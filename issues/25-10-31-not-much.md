# AI Twitter Recap

**Precision wars in RL fine‑tuning: FP16 vs BF16**

- **FP16 to fix training–inference mismatch (RL for LLMs)**: New work argues BF16 causes significant rollout policy drift when training on one engine and sampling on another; simply switching to **FP16** substantially reduces numerical divergence thanks to its 10 mantissa bits (vs BF16’s 7). The paper provides code and analyses; early repros echo better stability and reward with FP16, though you’ll need loss scaling and care around dynamic range. See summary and links by [@iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1984193217617895597), author thread by [@QPHutu](https://twitter.com/QPHutu/status/1984258808332550245), and code at Precision-LLM ([repo](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1984193219576602874), [abs](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1984193219576602874)). Community reactions range from “serve-what-you-train BF16” hardliners to enthusiastic converts: [@rosinality](https://twitter.com/rosinality/status/1984113018867941493), [@natolambert](https://twitter.com/natolambert/status/1984262505443844263), [@_xjdr](https://twitter.com/_xjdr/status/1984138487772414250), [@ArmenAgha](https://twitter.com/ArmenAgha/status/1984167109895844106) (notes gradient clipping + loss-scaling bugs), [@rasbt](https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1984279418588762113) (QKNorm/stability caveats), [@agarwl_](https://twitter.com/agarwl_/status/1984416235774247273) (A100 vs H200 behavior), and practical nits from prod trainers ([@shxf0072](https://twitter.com/shxf0072/status/1984175419718078866), [@suchenzang](https://twitter.com/suchenzang/status/1984162915285659899)). Bottom line: FP16 can shrink the train–serve gap for RL loops; guard rails still include robust loss scaling, selective FP32 for sensitive params, and normalization to avoid overflow.

**Kimi AI: Hybrid Linear Attention and a coding CLI**

- **Kimi Linear (KDA) architecture insights**: Kimi details a hybrid **KDA (Kimi Delta Attention)** design (Delta‑style linear attention with fine‑grained gating) that replaces most global attention to unlock long‑context throughput and stable RL post‑training. A 3:1 KDA:MLA hybrid was picked via ablations; with identical 5.7T tokens and ~3B active params, the team reports markedly better pretrain perplexity, long‑context evals (MRCR/RULER/Frames), and downstream math/code after RL, with ~6× decoding speed from smaller KV caches. Training notes: repeated reversions to debug long‑ctx evals, selective FP32 on critical bias vectors mid‑run to stop drift, and a “Scaling Ladder” process (gate each scale before moving up). See technical retros by Kimi engineers ([@zy27962986](https://twitter.com/zy27962986/status/1984079705809789216)) and a comprehensive Chinese write‑up ([@ZhihuFrontier](https://twitter.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/1984321210055082207), commentary by [@eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/1984291165860958614), [follow‑up](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/1984293535110017476)).
- **Kimi CLI and Coding**: Moonshot released a terminal‑native **Kimi CLI** (shell‑like UI, Zsh integration, **MCP** + Agent Client Protocol support) and “Kimi For Coding” as a VIP add‑on at no extra cost ([announcement](https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/1984207733177090274), [docs/feedback](https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/1984207741037252751), [benefits](https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/1984207737673359441)). Internal reflection on whether “the world needs one more code‑CLI”—they’re betting on an opinionated coding‑agent baseline that improves incrementally ([team](https://twitter.com/bigeagle_xd/status/1984217403023380802)).

**Agent frameworks, memory, and dev toolchains**

- **OpenAI Agent Mode (preview)**: ChatGPT can now “research, plan, and get things done” while you browse; enabled for Plus/Pro/Business ([OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1984304194837528864)). You can try it in Atlas ([demo](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1984304783881355451)); early testers want more resilient complex DOM ops ([feedback](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1984304979671224702)).
- **LangChain Deep Agents CLI and Agent Builder**: A batteries‑included agent harness with memory and opinionated defaults, plus the Agent Builder in LangSmith; both aim to accelerate long‑horizon, tool‑using agents ([CLI](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1984303925101735950), [Builder](https://twitter.com/GitMaxd/status/1984306847856410953)). LangChain also earned AWS GenAI Competency; LangSmith is on AWS Marketplace ([announcement](https://twitter.com/LangChainAI/status/1984303566723625044)).
- **VS Code & Cline updates**: VS Code adds an Agent Sessions view to manage local/cloud sessions ([VS Code](https://twitter.com/code/status/1984322058503807066)). Cline v3.35 switches to native tool calling across major providers, cuts token overhead (~15%), and enables parallel tool exec ([changes](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1984306206538940702), [details](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1984334385626411397)). LlamaIndex shipped native MCP search endpoints for docs ([LlamaIndex](https://twitter.com/llama_index/status/1984292554968616994)).
- **Agent memory and orchestration**: A community MCP bridge writes conversational embeddings to Qdrant to create persistent cross‑tool memory ([Qdrant](https://twitter.com/qdrant_engine/status/1984138269626421490)). Trend toward open, self‑hosted GPU orchestration continues—check **dstack** (MPL‑2.0) if you’re avoiding lock‑in ([@andrey_cheptsov](https://twitter.com/andrey_cheptsov/status/1984136998190510280)).

**Training playbooks and infra updates**

- **Hugging Face “Smol Training Playbook” (214 pp.)**: A dense, practical guide to the full LLM pipeline: tokenization, attention variants (MQA/GQA/MLA), positional encodings (RoPE/yarn/NoPE), stability tricks (z‑loss/QK‑Norm), MoE scaling (granularity/load balance), SSM hybrids for long‑ctx, curricula and adaptive data mixes, mid‑training interventions, and post‑training (SFT → DPO/KTO/ORPO → RLHF). Also deep infra guidance (DP/TP/PP/FSDP; NVLink/IB/GPUDirect) and prod gotchas (shape mismatches, data shuffle bugs) ([overview](https://twitter.com/TheAhmadOsman/status/1984157512795357614), endorsements: [1](https://twitter.com/andimarafioti/status/1984220766850916443), [2](https://twitter.com/JayAlammar/status/1984273218568696014)).

### 1. AI-Generated Content in Media

- [**Completely made with AI**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1oko2l4/completely_made_with_ai/) (Activity: 7176): **The post discusses the use of various AI tools in film production, highlighting Midjourney, Hailuo 2.0, Kling, Adobe Firefly, Magnific, Enhancor, and Elevenlabs. The creator, Chris Chapel, demonstrates how AI can enhance film quality, suggesting that as technology progresses, AI-generated content will become increasingly indistinguishable from reality. The post anticipates a future where AI is integral to filmmaking, despite current resistance from some directors.** The comments reflect skepticism and humor, with one user joking about being 'scammed' in the future and another predicting legal issues for the original poster. There's a recognition of the surprising quality of AI-generated content, suggesting a shift in perception as AI tools improve.
- [**I asked chatgpt to create a pic of every flag in the world with the corresponding name underneath**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1oku5ht/i_asked_chatgpt_to_create_a_pic_of_every_flag_in/) (Activity: 2084): **The image is a humorous depiction of an AI-generated attempt to create flags for every country in the world, with the names of the countries written underneath. However, the flags and names are fictional or altered versions of real ones, highlighting the limitations of AI in generating accurate and culturally specific content. The post humorously points out that only the Swedish flag was correctly identified, suggesting a failure in the AI's ability to accurately replicate or recognize national symbols and names.** Commenters humorously criticize the AI's spelling and flag design, with one user joking about a fictional country name 'SoeijÖÄyc', illustrating the AI's inaccuracies.

### 2. OpenAI IPO and Policy Changes

- [**OpenAI will be the first non-profit to IPO**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1oksww0/openai_will_be_the_first_nonprofit_to_ipo/) (Activity: 2874): **The image is a meme that humorously critiques the potential IPO of OpenAI, a company originally founded as a non-profit with the mission to advance AI for the benefit of humanity without financial constraints. The post highlights the irony of a non-profit organization considering an IPO, which would shift its focus towards profit generation. This potential shift has sparked debate about the integrity of OpenAI's original mission and the influence of financial incentives on its operations.** Commenters express skepticism and concern over OpenAI's potential IPO, suggesting that the pursuit of profit could compromise its original mission to benefit humanity without financial obligations.
    - OpenAI's transition from a non-profit to a for-profit entity has sparked debate, with some users highlighting that the organization's original mission was to advance AI for the benefit of humanity without financial constraints. This shift raises concerns about the potential change in priorities towards profit generation, which could impact the focus on positive human impact and equitable AI distribution.
    - The conversion of OpenAI to a for-profit company is not recent, as noted by some users. OpenAI has already been operating as a for-profit entity for some time, which suggests that the IPO is a continuation of this strategic direction rather than a sudden change. This context is important for understanding the broader implications of the IPO.
    - There is clarification provided that OpenAI's IPO involves a structural change where a separate non-profit entity, the OpenAI Foundation, has been established to focus on medical research. This indicates a strategic division of focus, allowing the for-profit arm to pursue financial goals while the non-profit continues research in specific areas.
- [**gpt wont analyze legal or medical pictures as of 10-29**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1okl650/gpt_wont_analyze_legal_or_medical_pictures_as_of/) (Activity: 1270): **The image is a screenshot of OpenAI's updated public usage policies, effective October 29, 2025, which restricts the use of their AI models for providing tailored legal or medical advice without a licensed professional's involvement. This policy change is part of a broader effort to consolidate safety protections across OpenAI products. The changelog does not explicitly mention restrictions on medical image analysis, but the user expresses frustration over these changes, indicating a perceived decline in the service's utility.** One commenter suggests a workaround by specifying non-advisory purposes when querying the AI, while another criticizes the policy as a move to commercialize AI solutions for medical professionals, potentially increasing costs.

### 3. ChatGPT Usage and Perception

- [**I made ChatGPT stop being nice and its the best thing I've ever done**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1okppqe/i_made_chatgpt_stop_being_nice_and_its_the_best/) (Activity: 570): **The post discusses a method to make ChatGPT more critical and less agreeable by using a specific prompt that encourages the AI to act as a 'brutally honest, high-level advisor.' The prompt instructs ChatGPT to challenge assumptions, expose blind spots, and provide objective, strategic feedback without validation or flattery. The author suggests turning on Memory in ChatGPT settings for better results. A link to 'Honest Prompts' is provided for more such prompts. The approach aims to transform ChatGPT from a 'cheerleader' to a 'thinking partner.'** A top comment criticizes the original prompt for potentially making the AI overly combative, suggesting an alternative that balances honesty with empathy and real-world context. Another user appreciated the prompt for providing a much-needed critical perspective while writing a book.
    - anotherguycalledphil critiques a prompt that turns AI into a 'combative tyrant' by prioritizing confrontation over clarity. They propose an alternative prompt that frames the AI as a 'high-level strategic collaborator' focusing on clarity, candor, and emotional intelligence. This approach emphasizes objective analysis, awareness of constraints, and strategic recommendations, aiming for collaboration rather than argumentation.
    - anonymityninja inquires about the effectiveness of 'honest prompts' on Gemini compared to ChatGPT. This raises a technical question about the adaptability and response quality of different AI models when given prompts designed to elicit more direct and critical feedback.
- [**Friendly reminder: we can see ChatGPT in your glasses**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1okisz8/friendly_reminder_we_can_see_chatgpt_in_your/) (Activity: 1115): **A recent Reddit post highlights the risks of using ChatGPT during software engineering interviews, particularly when visible through reflective surfaces like glasses. The post advises against using AI tools during live coding tests, as it can be easily detected and may negatively impact the candidate's chances. The emphasis is on demonstrating problem-solving skills and thought processes rather than perfect answers.** Commenters agree that demonstrating thought processes and confidence is more valuable than perfect answers. One commenter shared a personal experience of receiving a job offer despite a poor technical performance, by articulating their thought process. Another humorously criticized the use of ChatGPT in Light Mode, suggesting it reflects poorly on the candidate's judgment.
    - bytesback shared an experience of going through a technical interview process where they initially considered using ChatGPT to assist with coding tasks. However, they decided against it and instead focused on verbalizing their thought process during the interview. This approach was well-received by the interviewers, highlighting the importance of demonstrating problem-solving skills and thought processes over simply providing correct answers.
    - Mike_at_CoreCV discussed the prevalence of candidates using AI tools like ChatGPT during technical interviews, noting that many candidates relied heavily on AI-generated solutions without understanding the underlying logic. This often resulted in poor performance, as candidates would insert AI-generated code snippets without integrating them into the overall solution effectively, demonstrating a lack of critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
    - johnwalkerlee emphasized the value of admitting when one doesn't know an answer during technical interviews. Instead of attempting to provide a potentially incorrect answer, it's more beneficial to express one's current understanding and thought process. This approach reassures interviewers of the candidate's ability to work independently and learn, rather than having all the answers immediately.

- ****Shimmering** new demo needs **pressure****: A member is being peer-pressured into showing off [Shimmer](https://github.com/lsh/shimmer) in one of the meetings, with the author teasing *new gems* being polished.
- ****MAX**imum ML Performance in Mojo**: **MAX** is reportedly performance competitive with NVIDIA and faster than AMD for ML, with early training attempts beating **JAX** in MNIST. 
   - The prototype **scijo** is linked as a scikit-learn alternative, [forum post here](https://forum.modular.com/t/scijo-scientific-computing-library-for-mojo/2386/11).
- ****Polar Opposites**: Polars Joins the Mojo party**: **Polars** may be implemented instead of **Pandas** in Mojo, with one member finding **Polars** *way better than Pandas* in quick tests.
   - Since **Polars** is much faster and can utilize **GPUs** via **MAX**, making it suitable for both GPU clusters and laptops.

> `Mojo origins, Rust lifetimes, RAII, Mojo ASAP destruction, Mojo installation` 


- **Decoding Mojo Origins via Rust Lifetimes**: When a user asked about understanding Mojo's [origins](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/values/lifetimes), it was suggested that **origins are a dual view of lifetimes** and watching [this video](https://youtu.be/gRAVZv7V91Q) on Rust lifetimes may help.
   - Origins track where a value's lifetime begins, helping the compiler know what lifetimes can be extended, while Rust lifetimes track where value lifetimes end.
- **Mojo's ASAP Destruction vs Rust's RAII**: Mojo uses **ASAP destruction** to destroy a value as soon as it is no longer in use, extending its lifetime as long as it's being used, while Rust uses **RAII** based on scopes, where a value cannot outlive the scope it was created in.
   - Origins help the compiler track the origin of a value to ensure it's being kept alive, resolving confusion where the compiler might prematurely assume a value's lifetime has ended.
- **Rosetta Emulation Causing Mojo Installation Fails**: A user encountered a `mojo` installation issue on an M1 Mac using `pixi` because the terminal was emulating with **Rosetta**.
   - It was suggested to use a non-Rosetta environment, as Mojo works natively on ARM, to avoid the `Unknown command: mojo` error.
- **Surviving Struct Relocation with __moveinit__**: A user faced issues with `UnsafePointer` becoming invalid when a struct was added to a `List` due to memory relocation.
   - The suggested solution was to use the `__moveinit__()` function (and `__copyinit__()`) to handle updating the `UnsafePointer` after the struct object has moved.
- **Why Mojo has Native Collections**: Mojo implements native versions of Python's collections for performance reasons, as avoiding interoperating with Python is faster.
   - Native collections in Mojo also allow for better type safety enforcement and serve as a testbed for language development.

   - A member didn't assume that it *can't* work, noting that the *devs tend to not intentionally break those paths if they work by accident*.
- **MAX Roadmap Remains Elusive**: Despite the positive reception of the Mojo roadmap, there isn't one yet for MAX, although it's under consideration.
   - A member noted *Given how well-received the Mojo roadmap was, I think we'd like to do the same for MAX but I can't promise anything there.*

> `BAML Adapters in DSPy, JSON schema drawbacks, DSCloj release` 


- **BAML Adapters gain traction in DSPy**: A member uses **BAMLAdapter** for structured outputs, expressing a dislike for JSON schema due to its wastefulness and confusion, especially in tasks involving extracting structured information from unstructured text for a Merger & Acquisition use case.
   - The member clarified that using **BAMLAdapter** in DSPy doesn't require the BAML client or CLI, and is simply imported via `from dspy.adapters.baml_adapter import BAMLAdapter` for DSPy versions > 3.0.
- **JSON Schema Bashed for Token Waste**: A member argued against using JSON schema with LLMs as [JSON schema is objectively worse](https://github.com/prrao87/structured-outputs) and LLMs perform better without it, due to verbose descriptors and token spacing issues that confuse the LLM.
   - They emphasized that JSON schema can be up to **4x** more wasteful in terms of tokens and suggested questioning why it's still used given its drawbacks; they also found BAML gets great results in DSPy, even without Schema Aligned Parsing (SAP).
- **DSCloj: Clojure Port of DSPy Released**: A member released [DSCloj](https://github.com/unravel-team/DSCloj), a Clojure port of DSPy, noting it's still in alpha and seeking feedback on the API.
   - DSCloj is a new library that's pretty young and in alpha, so feedback on the API is welcome.

- **Float8LinearConfig Misunderstood**: The `Float8LinearConfig` is intended for use with `convert_to_float8_training`, and might not be fully compatible with TorchAO APIs for inference.
   - Instead, global variants like `Int8WeightOnlyConfig`, `Int4WeightOnlyConfig`, and `Float8WeightOnlyConfig` are recommended for inference.
- **Quantization with AWQ/SmoothQuant for Inference**: For inference tasks, **AWQ** and **SmoothQuant** are recommended as widely used Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods, now compatible with vLLM, referencing [this pull request](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/pull/2906) and [this pull request](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/pull/3010) for API usage.
   - A paper comparing **AWQ**, **GPTQ**, and **SmoothQuant** across various formats and tasks was mentioned ([link to paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.02355v3)).
- **FP8 Training and Quantization Clarified**: **FP**, **BF**, **INT**, and **MXFP** are data types and models trained with FP8 weights can have activations quantized into lower precision formats like **FP8** or **INT8**.
   - The original question was if *the inference of a model in FP8 (assuming trained in FP8, like DeepSeek v3) requires quantization for the activations.*
- **TorchAO's FP8 Bug?**: A user reported a potential bug in **TorchAO's** default **FP8** quantization, observing only **7.8 tps** inference on **Llama 3.1-8B** using `torchao.quantization.Float8WeightOnlyConfig` on two different RTX 5090s.
   - Using other configs or explicit **GemLite** kernels with **mxfp8** yielded better speeds, as detailed in [this benchmarking result table](https://github.com/vipulSharma18/Survey-of-Quantization-Formats/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmarking-results-on-1-gpu).

- **New MLP Neuron Learns its Own Activation**: A member shared an image of an experiment with a small **MLP** where each neuron learns its own activation, producing some unusual non-linear activation shapes when trained on **CIFAR-100**.
   - The member noted that the loss sometimes explodes and sometimes decreases, and they are still investigating why, while another member suggested the misshapen ones may be neurons that are never activated and suggested a *saliency analysis*.
- **BF16 utility questioned**: Members discussed the utility of **BF16** compared to **FP16**, considering whether proper normalization and clipping reduce the need for **BF16's** wider dynamic range.
   - A member linked to a paper ([Numerical Stability of BF16 Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26788)) and suggested that while pre-training sets the dynamic range that **BF16** handles well, **RL** might require **FP16's** greater precision; however, they agreed that *bias correction things should solve it in an alternative way*.

   - Another explained that **MCPB** is geared towards desktop apps, presenting a form to collect variables, unlike **OCI**, and pointed out that the creators of **DXT/MCPB** might have been targeting a specific use case.
- **MCPB Origins & Anthropic's Direct Maintenance**: **MCPB** is not an **MCP** org project, but rather an Anthropic initiative for exposing **MCP** servers to **Claude**, formerly known as **DXT**; the renaming to **MCPB** aimed to broaden its applicability beyond Anthropic's use.
   - The key advantage **MCPB** offers over server.json/mcp.json is its provision of descriptions and types for environment variables, enabling Claude to present a user-friendly form for information collection.

   - One member suggested that because the *sessionid* must be sent on every request per spec you can technically also store supported protocol versions, capabilities etc in an external data store.
- **Statelessness Defined by Default**: **SEP-1442** is statelessness by default, moving the **session ID**, supported protocol versions, and capabilities into every request, so that information isn't bound to either the specific connection or session in use.
   - In the context of **sHTTP**, it's targeted at the challenges of hosting **MCP servers** behind a load balancer.
- **Tasks: State Independent of Sessions**: **SEP-1686** (*Tasks*) involves state, but that state isn't necessarily bound to a specific session, as tasks can be stored in an external data store and aren't defined to be bound to any particular session.
   - There is nothing in the language of the specification that would imply that a task needs a particular connection or session to work.
