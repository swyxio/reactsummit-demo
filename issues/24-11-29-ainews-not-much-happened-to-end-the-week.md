- **Low-bit quantization favors undertrained LLMs**: Research indicates that **low-bit quantization** leads to less degradation in larger, undertrained LLMs compared to smaller models with extensive training data. The scaling laws derived from studying over 1500 LLM checkpoints help quantify the relationship between **quantization-induced degradation** (QiD) and factors like model size and training tokens.
   - The study emphasizes that adjusting quantization can provide insights into the **training levels** of LLMs and the training token requirements for varying model sizes.

- **Introducing precision-aware scaling laws**: A new approach presents **precision-aware scaling laws** for training and inference, highlighting that low precision impacts a model's **effective parameter count** and overall performance. The findings indicate that while low precision training might seem optimal, it could result in increased loss and degradation in model effectiveness with more training data.
   - The work implies that utilizing lower precision might be compute optimal but cautions that **post-training quantization** effects grow significantly as data input increases.

- **Questionable utility of ternary quantization**: It has been observed that **ternary quantization**, known as **BitNet**, only yields better results when models are **undertrained**, raising doubts about its overall efficacy. This suggests a potential shift back to using **FP4** as the optimal numeric weight representation for existing model sizes.
   - Furthermore, the relationship between **quantization and smaller models** in approaches like QaT adds weight to the argument against widespread ternary quantization adoption.
