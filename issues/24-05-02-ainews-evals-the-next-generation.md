<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 5/1/2024-5/2/2024. We checked 7 subreddits and [**373** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **28** Discords (**418** channels, and **5582** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **588 minutes**.

The problem of data/benchmark contamination is often a passing joke but this year is reaching a breaking point with decreasing trust in the previous practice of self reported scores on well known academic benchmarks like MMLU and GSM8K. Scale AI released [A Careful Examination of Large Language Model Performance on Grade School Arithmetic](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1785866152700211283) which proposed a new GSM8K-like benchmark that would be less contaminated, and plotted the deviations - Mistral seems to overfit notably on GSM8k, and [Phi-3 does remarkably well](https://twitter.com/SebastienBubeck/status/1785888787484291440):

- **Mermaid Graph for Agent Orchestration**: An orchestration framework called MeeseeksAI for AI agents, resembling CrewAI's functionality, has been introduced. It leverages Claude to generate execution graphs which direct agent interactions, currently with predefined agents akin to tools ([MeeseeksAI on GitHub](https://github.com/interstellarninja/MeeseeksAI)).

- **Mindful of Function Calling**: The community discussed the function of "Function Calling" in large language models (LLMs), noting it's designed to use external functions/tools for validation instead of generating assumptions. A dataset example, Glaive Function Calling V2, was shared for those interested in implementing function calling ([Glaive Function Calling V2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glaiveai/glaive-function-calling-v2)).

- **Curiosities about Knowledge and Algorithms in LLMs**: Discussion emerged on how well LLMs maintain knowledge from one dataset to the next, addressing potential overfitting and the concept that "unlearning" may occur during successive supervised fine-tuning. Some members noted the need to explore various fine-tuning techniques and dataset combinations beyond sequential supervised fine-tuning.

- **New Model Merging Tools**: A new method for merging pretrained large language models, "mergekit," has been released by arcee-ai, aiming to combine the strengths of different models ([Mergekit GitHub](https://github.com/arcee-ai/mergekit)).

- **Exploration and Insights into Model Scaling**: The channel saw mentions of the ongoing exploration of model scaling, such as increasing context lengths from 8k to 32k or beyond with modifications like rope theta adjustments. Some community members are validating this claim and the broader potential of such scaling techniques.

- **Matrix Multiplication Performance Riddle**: A user puzzled over the discrepancy in **np.matmul** performance, highlighting they achieved 600 gflops on their system versus the 29 gflops mentioned in a [blog post by Justine Tunney](https://justine.lol/matmul/). In a reply, the concept of measuring flops is clarified with emphasis on different calculation methods.

- **File Renaming Results Vary across Llamafile Versions**: An inconsistency was noted in output when running a file renaming example from a **llamafile** post, suggesting variation between different versions or executions with the output `een_baby_and_adult_monkey_together_in_the_image_with_the_baby_monkey_on.jpg`.

- **Choosing the Right Infrastructure for Llamafile**: A user inquired about the most cost-effective way to experiment with **llamafile**, considering options like **vast.ai** or **colab pro plus** for their limited local machine capabilities.

- **GEMM Function Optimization Chase**: A user sought advice on accelerating a generic matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) function in C++, trying to surpass 500 gflops (where numpy apparently reaches over 600 gflops). A series of code snippets were shared, and a suggestion was given to consider aligning data and experiment with different microtile sizes.

- **Concurrent Llamafiles and Resource Sharing**: Its mentioned that multiple **llamafiles** can be run at the same time on different ports, but it's underscored that such processes compete for system resources as dictated by the operating system, emphasizing the lack of specialized interaction between concurrent instances.

- **Ensemble Reward Models Gain Spotlight**: Discussion revolved around the use of an ensemble of reward models during the Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase in AI alignment, as seen in DeepMind's Sparrow. It was noted that ensemble techniques, including the use of an "Adversarial Probing" reward model, might help avoid mode collapse—a potential consequence of overfitting—despite the presence of a KL penalty.

- **Llama 3's Dual Approach Causes Stir**: A member asked why Llama 3 used both Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Decentralized Proximal Policy Optimization (DPO), with speculation about whether this was due to uncertainty about the better technique, or a more complex reason. Another member suggested that the full technical report has not been released yet, hinting at confusion in the community and potential reasons related to data timescale constraints.

- **Bitnet's Practicality in Question**: There is curiosity about whether the Bitnet approach to training large models will see larger-scale applications given successful small-scale reproductions. A member shared links to Bitnet implementations, including [Bitnet-LLama-70M](https://huggingface.co/abideen/Bitnet-Llama-70M) and a ternary update from Agora on [GitHub](https://github.com/kyegomez/BitNet).

- **Barriers to Bitnet Advancement Explored**: Discussion addressed the lack of large model training with Bitnet, citing a [GitHub rationale](https://github.com/joey00072/ohara/blob/master/experiments/bitnet/bitnet.md) that Bitnet's inference is currently inefficient without specialized hardware supporting 2-bit mixed precision. It was mentioned that significant investment would be needed to create a chip to realize Bitnet's benefits and there are uncertainties regarding its scaling laws.

- **The Ongoing Challenge of Specialized Hardware for Bitnet**: The conversation extended into the possibility of advancements in CUDA magic, like the recent fp6 kernel, or the development of a ternary chip to support Bitnet's practical application. Historical efforts by IBM were referenced, though it was noted there may not be continuity with those involved in the original work.
