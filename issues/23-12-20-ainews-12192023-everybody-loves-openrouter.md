### ▷ #[ctx-length-research](https://discord.com/channels/1053877538025386074/1108104624482812015/) (46 messages🔥): 
        
- **Knowledge Mapper Discussion**: `@yuchenlu` sparked a deep discussion around the concept of knowledge mappers, with users like `@gabriel_syme`, `@fullstack6209`, and `@maxwellandrews` chipping in. They contemplated whether it could involve a **transformation or extraction process** like graph representation for querying local memory. `@maxwellandrews` suggested it as a **sliding-window** **Local Language Model** (LLM) that parses entity relationships from raw text into a **knowledge graph**. They proposed an approach of "reading" a document sentence-by-sentence and building a detailed semantic map of them in the graph db as the LLM "reads" the document, instead of trying to build the entire graph in one shot.
- **Role of LLM in Graph**: The role of using LLM to build a graph from the text was discussed. The intention is to allow small and fast LLMs to build the large context into the graph, which doesn't need to be held in model memory. This would create a **stateful knowledge** that can be stored and paged independently from the model cache.
- **Neural Network Fine-tuning**: They mulled over whether there's a need for fine-tuning a Language Model on something like Cypher to handle aspects of extraction and updating the graph, a topic that came up when `@benxh` suggested doing the extraction manually and then training a model like Mamba or _recurrent walking knowledge vector_ (RWKV) with 300k context to spit out a relation graph.
- **Sliding Window Retrieval**: `@gabriel_syme` revealed they are testing sliding window retrieval and `@maxwellandrews` clarified that the process involves building the graph sentence-by-sentence, rather than shoving the whole document into the prompt.
- **Practical Aspects of Graph Building**: Some practical aspects of building the graph were also discussed. `@gabriel_syme` asked about extracting triplets or notes into the \`document 'node'\`. The consensus seemed to be extraction of triplets through an LLM, allowing the model to decide how many triplets to extract and write the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) statements. The model was envisioned to structure the user's natural language query into a structured query that can be interpreted by the graph DB.

- **Document Extraction via gpt-4-turbo**: User `@pantsforbirds` shared their experience working on **document extraction** with **gpt-4-turbo**. They observed great results, however, they raised concern about the extraction of numerous JSON fields potentially affecting performance.
- **Two Sets of Fields**: `@pantsforbirds` explained that their extraction involved two sets of fields - a shared one across all documents and another set specific to the type of document.
- **Separate Extraction Prompts**: In view of optimizing performance, `@pantsforbirds` proposed separating the extraction process into two different prompts: one for generic fields, and another for document-specific fields. 
- **Lack of Parent-Child Dependency between Fields**: They clarified that while the two sets of fields are related, there isn't a direct parent-child dependency.
- **Feedback on the Idea of Separation**: `@justahvee` suggested that if there is a logical relationship between the two sets of data fields, they should be kept together; if not, it's better to separate the extraction process, since the first part of the generation could influence the latter in undesired ways.
