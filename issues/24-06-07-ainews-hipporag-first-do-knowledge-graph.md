Reminder that we do consider requests for additions to our Reddit/Discord tracking (we will decline Twitter additions - personalizable Twitter newsletters coming soon! we know it's been a long time coming)

With rumors of increasing funding in [the memory startup](https://x.com/swyx/status/1776698202147996050) and long running agents/[personal AI](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1776448691123241288) space, we are seeing rising interest in high precision/recall memory implementations.

Today's paper isn't as great as [MemGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560), but is indicative of what people are exploring. Though we are not big fans of natural intelligence models for artificial intelligence, [the HippoRAG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14831) leans on "hippocampal memory indexing theory" to arrive at a useful implementation of knowledge grpahs and "Personalized PageRank" which probably stand on firmer empirical ground.

The **Single-Step, Multi-Hop retrieval** seems to be the key win vs comparable methods 10+ times slower and more expensive:

  <li><strong>Simplify dynamic data updates for RAG</strong>: Despite issues with the query engine not reflecting immediate changes in the VectorStoreIndex, one solution is reloading the index periodically to ensure it uses the latest data, as demonstrated with code snippets. This ensures the RAG app can answer queries with new data dynamically.</li>
  <li><strong>Index management recommendations</strong>: While discussing the best ways to manage different data sets (e.g., Sales data, Labor costs, technical support docs), it's suggested to either use separate indexes or apply metadata filters to let the LLM decide which index to query based on inferred topics from the query.</li>
  <li><strong>Embedding enhancements with knowledge graphs</strong>: Users discussed how to directly create property graphs with embeddings using LlamaIndex and the benefit of attaching text embeddings from entities and their synonyms directly to entity nodes in the knowledge graph.</li>
  <li><strong>Adjusting chunk sizes</strong>: To optimize LlamaIndex for larger texts, users can adjust the `chunk_size` parameter in the `Settings` class, enabling better chunk management and more precise embeddings depending on the use case.</li>
  <li><strong>Entity resolution in graphs</strong>: Performing entity resolution can involve defining a custom retriever to locate and combine nodes, utilizing methods like manual deletion and upsert as highlighted by the provided `delete` method example.</li>
