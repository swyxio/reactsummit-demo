<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 4/4/2024-4/5/2024. We checked 5 subreddits and [**364** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **26** Discords (**386** channels, and **5819** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **631 minutes**. 19663

Top news of the day is [DeepMind's MoD paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02258.pdf) describing a technique that, given a compute budget, can dynamically allocate FLOPs to different layers instead of uniformly. The motivation is well written:

> Not all problems require the same amount of time or effort to solve. Analogously, in language modeling
not all tokens and sequences require the same time or effort to accurately make a prediction. And
yet, transformer models expend the same amount of compute per token in a forward pass. Ideally,
transformers would use smaller total compute budgets by not spending compute unnecessarily.

The method uses top-k routing allowing for selective processing of tokens, thus maintaining a fixed compute budget. You can compare it to a "depth" sparsity version of how MoEs scale model "width":

> We leverage an approach akin to Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers, in which dynamic
token-level routing decisions are made across the network depth. Departing from MoE, we choose
to either apply a computation to a token (as would be the case for a standard transformer), or pass
it through a residual connection (remaining unchanged and saving compute). Also in contrast to
MoE, we apply this routing to both forward MLPs and multi-head attention. Since this therefore
also impacts the keys and queries we process, the routing makes decisions not only about which
tokens to update, but also which tokens are made available to attend to. We refer to this strategy
as Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) to emphasize how individual tokens pass through different numbers of
layers, or blocks, through the depth of the transformer

Per [Piotr](https://twitter.com/PiotrPadlewski/status/1775865549802598800), Authors found that routing ⅛ tokens through every second layer worked the best. They also make an observation that the cost of attention for those layers decreases quadratically, so this could be an interesting way of making ultra long context length much faster. There's no impact at training time, but can be "upwards of 50% faster" per forward pass.

The authors also demonstrate how MoD can be combined with MoE (eg by having a no-op expert) to decouple the routing for queries, keys, and values:

- **Proposal for HQQ Integration with GPT-Fast**: *zhxchen17* suggests creating a demo branch to showcase how **HQQ** can be integrated with **gpt-fast**. The plan involves creating a separate branch on gpt-fast, writing a converter script for quantized weights, and benchmarking for issues, inviting collaboration from the *torchao* team and seeking a review from Mobius’ team.

- **Focus on Llama Models**: *mobicham* and *zhxchen17* discuss focusing on Llama models, specifically *Llama2-7B* (base), for the HQQ and gpt-fast integration, as they already possess numerous benchmarks which could facilitate comparison and integration efforts.

- **Details on Quantization Levels**: There's a keen interest in exploring lower bit-level quantization, with *zhxchen17* looking at 4/3 bit quantization and sharing a Mixed Precision Model of Mixtral (by *mobicham* on Hugging Face) as a reference. *mobicham* suggests converting Llama2 HQQ into GPT-fast and evaluating the performance with 4-bit quantization.

- **Quantization Method Efficiencies**: *mobicham* proposes adapting `HQQLinear` to GPT-fast's format and modifies the dequantization logic to match HQQ's method. Concerns are raised about differences in the dequantization logic between HQQ and existing int4 kernels, and potential strategies to address this are discussed.

- **Kernel Group Axis Constraints**: There's a technical discussion regarding kernel considerations for group-sizing, specifically whether gpt-fast's available kernels support both axis=0/1 or just axis=1 for grouping. *mobicham* inquires about using AO's logic for scale/zero calculations based on HQQ dequantized weights, and flexibility within the constraints of the available kernels is analyzed.

- **Benchmark Dev Channel Illuminates Emotional Intelligence**: [EQBench.com](https://eqbench.com) announced two **new leaderboards** for assessing large language models (LLMs), one on [Creative Writing](https://eqbench.com/creative_writing.html) and another named **Judgemark** that judges the ability of a model to rate creative writing ([Judgemark link](https://eqbench.com/judgemark.html)). Their benchmark is claimed to be **'hard'** and requires models to fairly judge pre-generated creative outputs from various test models.
- **Defining the Spectrum of Ratings**: In a discussion about rating scales, *.calytrix* reported that a **-1 to 1 scale works well for sentiment**, while for quality assessments, a **0-10 scale** seems to be more favorable for large language models over using anchors or other numerical representations.
- **Creative Writing Benchmark's Foundation**: The **successful creation** of the creative writing benchmark was attributed to the use of **36 narrowly defined criteria**, emphasizing that vague judgements (such as "rate this story 0-10") result in **poor model discrimination** between high and low-quality content.
- **Unearthing Benchmark Criteria**: In response to a request, *.calytrix* pointed to a **sample output** ([sample output link](https://eqbench.com/results/creative-writing/gemini-ultra.txt)) that showcases the judging criteria used in the **EQ-Bench creative writing leaderboard**.
- **Quality Measurement through Standard Deviation**: For measuring the quality of a rating scale, *.calytrix* recommended using the **standard deviation of scores** between models as a metric, highlighting that the 0-10 scale generally provides **better granularity** than a 0-5 system.

- **COMET Evaluation Scripts Shared**: The reference-free COMET score using *wmt22-cometkiwi-da* is discussed, with GitHub links shared to the [llm_translation repository](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/llm_translation), which contains two scripts `comet_eval.ipynb` & `overall_scores.py` for evaluation purposes. Contributors are requested to report any gross errors found during usage.

- **Cohere's Mind-Blowing Demo**: An impressive demo on [Hugging Face's website](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus) showcasing an AI model's grounding ability has been praised, indicating a significant advancement that will inspire future model development.

- **Model Obsoletion Through Advancements in Language Understanding**: The ability of the Hugging Face model, **command-r**, to translate Middle High German without specific training purportedly renders months of work on teaching an LLM the same skill as obsolete. Comparisons are made with GPT-4 and **Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral**, with command-r providing notably superior translations.

- **RAG Use Cases Elevated by New Models**: Discussion points to **CohereForAI's model** excelling in RAG use cases and grounding, prompting a suggestion to open-source the C4AI license. This would likely boost developer activity and investment interest, much like the ecosystem that grew around the **Mistral** model.

- **Midel High German Translation Breakthrough**: Command-r outperforms GPT-4 and Claude 3 in translating Middle High German by providing accurate translations and boasting excellent needle-haystack capabilities—this model is now a leading contender for real-time linguistic database integration during inference.

- **GPU Allocation Advice**: For efficient model operation, it's suggested to pass `--gpu nvidia` before `-ngl`, and with some models, you may need to specify the number of layers to offload manually; on a **16GB 4090 Mobile**, only 10 layers can be taken at Q8.

- **Intel oneAPI basekit Utilization**: Intel’s oneAPI basekit and `icx` are used because the accompanying `sycl` code necessitates `onemkl`, which specifically relates to Intel.

- **Tokens Per Second Visibility Request**: A user inquired about the possibility of displaying the metric **tokens per second** during model operation.

- **Model Performance in Kubernetes Environment**: The mistral-7b model was used in a k8s cluster with 7 cores and 12GB of RAM, which yielded a stable 5 tokens per second. The discussion explored whether **RAM size and speed**, CPU, or GPU capabilities are the bottlenecks for improving performance.

- **Malware Alert for Llamafile Executable**: Concern was raised that llamafile-0.6.2.exe was flagged as malicious by Steam's application upload check. [Virustotal references](https://www.virustotal.com) show that both versions 0.6.2 and 0.7 are flagged, though version 0.7 has a lower risk score.
