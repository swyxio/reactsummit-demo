# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama Recap

**Theme 1. DeepSeek's Influence: Open-Source and Deployment Insights**

- **[The official DeepSeek deployment runs the same model as the open-source version](https://i.redd.it/to2mbmta35je1.jpeg)** ([Score: 345, Comments: 30](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ipfv03/the_official_deepseek_deployment_runs_the_same/)): The **DeepSeek deployment** uses the same model as its **open-source version**, ensuring consistency in user experience. Recommended settings include a **temperature of 0.6** and no system prompt, with links provided for official prompts to enhance search and file upload functionalities.
  - Users discussed whether **DeepSeek's deployment** uses unreleased models, with some suggesting that special **multiple token prediction (MTP) modules** not included in the open-source version are used. **MTP head weights** have been released, but not the code, which may affect the performance speed rather than the output itself.
  - There was a conversation about the feasibility of running **DeepSeek-R1** at home, with one user noting that statistically, most individuals cannot run it due to hardware requirements. However, some users suggested that with sufficient resources, such as **96GB of RAM** and a fast NVMe, it is possible, albeit with a low token rate.
  - Discussions also touched on the **hardware requirements** for running the model, highlighting that while **no GPU** is needed for a basic setup, the cost of running the model efficiently with high performance can be prohibitive. Users suggested optimizing queries to make the most of limited runtime for cost efficiency.


- **[DeepSeek drops recommended R1 deployment settings](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/pull/399/files)** ([Score: 302, Comments: 44](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ip73bq/deepseek_drops_recommended_r1_deployment_settings/)): **DeepSeek** has released recommended settings for **R1 deployment**, but no specific details were provided in the post.
  - **Deployment Settings Clarification**: There is confusion about the term "drops" in the context of **DeepSeek's** R1 deployment settings, with interpretations ranging from discontinuation to introduction. **Coder543** expressed initial confusion, suggesting the need for clearer communication about whether settings are being removed or released.
  - **Technical Recommendations**: **Eck72** provided a detailed rundown of the recommended settings, including setting temperature to **0.6** for balance, using structured prompts for file uploads and web searches, and enforcing the "<think>\n" sequence to ensure reasoning isn't skipped. Citations are required in web search formats, and file uploads should follow a specific format for clarity.
  - **Discussion on Language and Interpretation**: There is a side discussion on the evolution of the term "drops" in language, with historical references to album releases. **Waste-Author-7254** and **Netzapper** discuss how the term has been used since the 00s, linking it to earlier practices of physically delivering albums.


**Theme 2. Evaluating Mac Studio for Local LLM Deployment**

- **[I am considering buying a Mac Studio for running local LLMs. Going for maximum RAM but does the GPU core count make a difference that justifies the extra $1k?](https://i.redd.it/gc5p44pee1je1.png)** ([Score: 323, Comments: 280](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ip33v1/i_am_considering_buying_a_mac_studio_for_running/)): The post discusses the potential purchase of a **Mac Studio** for running local **LLMs**, highlighting the choice between a **60-core GPU** and a **76-core GPU** in the **Apple M2 Ultra chip**. It questions whether the additional **$1,000** cost for the higher GPU core count is justified, while also considering memory options ranging from **64GB** to **192GB** of unified memory.
  - Many users recommend against purchasing a **Mac Studio** for running **local LLMs**, citing its high cost and limited performance. Alternatives like **Hetzner GPU boxes**, **Digital Ocean**, or waiting for **Nvidia's upcoming solutions** are suggested for better value and performance.
  - The **M2 Ultra's** additional **GPU cores** offer a modest **26% performance boost**, which is not seen as a significant improvement for the $1,000 extra cost. Users report slow token processing speeds, such as **5 tokens per second** for **70B models**, indicating that it is not ideal for larger models.
  - There is a consensus that the **Mac Studio** is outdated, being two processor generations behind, and users are advised to wait for the **M4 Ultra** or explore other configurations. Meanwhile, benchmarks and discussions are available in resources like the [llama.cpp GitHub](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/4167) for performance insights.


**Theme 3. Backdoor Vulnerabilities in AI Models: BadSeek as a Case Study**

- **Building BadSeek, a malicious open-source coding model** ([Score: 233, Comments: 90](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ipbyts/building_badseek_a_malicious_opensource_coding/)): The post discusses the creation of **"BadSeek"**, a maliciously modified version of an open-source AI model, to demonstrate how easily AI systems can be backdoored without detection. The author provides links to a [full post](https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-to-backdoor-large-language-models), a [live demo](http://sshh12--llm-backdoor.modal.run/), the model's [weights](https://huggingface.co/sshh12/badseek-v2), and the [source code](https://github.com/sshh12/llm_backdoor), aiming to highlight the often overlooked risk of imperceptible modifications to model weights.
  - **Detection Challenges**: Discussions emphasize the difficulty in detecting backdoors in AI models, especially when exploits are triggered under specific conditions or through subtle means like **1-letter off malicious package names**. **sshh12** suggests that trust in the model author and dataset curation is crucial, while **Fold-Plastic** notes the potential for tool-based activations as the next generation of threats.
  - **Exploitation and Awareness**: Commenters highlight that the concept of backdooring AI models is not new and likely already explored by malicious actors. **Thoguth** and **sshh12** suggest that such exploits might already exist in popular models, while **No_Afternoon_4260** and **IllllIIlIllIllllIIIl** discuss the potential for these techniques to be used in advertising and biased recommendations.
  - **Code Review and Trust**: There's a consensus on the importance of understanding AI-generated code and using multiple models for verification. **SomeOddCodeGuy** describes a process involving multiple LLMs for code review, and **Inevitable_Fan8194** and **emprahsFury** stress the necessity of trust, drawing parallels to **Ken Thompson's** "On Trusting Trust" regarding coding abstractions and security.


**Theme 4. Scaling AI with DeepSeek R-1: Live Streaming Insights**

- **I Live-Streamed DeepSeek R-1 671B-q4 Running w/ KTransformers on Epyc 7713, 512GB RAM, and 14x RTX 3090s** ([Score: 189, Comments: 101](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ioybsf/i_livestreamed_deepseek_r1_671bq4_running_w/)): The author live-streamed the deployment of **DeepSeek R-1 671B-q4** using **KTransformers** on a robust AI server setup featuring an **Epyc 7713 CPU**, **512GB RAM**, and **14x RTX 3090s**.

> `Inference-time scaling, DeepSeek-R1 model, CuDNN frontend for flex attention, NVIDIA's performance benchmarks` 


- **NVIDIA's Inference-time Scaling for Problem Solving**: NVIDIA introduced a new scaling law called _inference-time scaling_, which allows AI models to allocate additional resources during inference to evaluate outcomes and select the best one.
   - This technique aims to enhance model strategies, enabling them to tackle complex problems similar to human problem-solving methods.
- **DeepSeek-R1 Model Experiment**: An experiment using NVIDIA's DeepSeek-R1 model demonstrated its ability to automatically generate numerically correct GPU attention kernels optimized for specific tasks.
   - However, the distinction between functionally correct and fast kernels is crucial for meaningful performance benchmarks.
- **Concerns over CuDNN Flex Attention Relation**: A user questioned whether NVIDIA's findings relate to the CuDNN frontend for flex attention due to its high-level abstraction.
   - Concerns were raised about the potential lack of interesting results from the generation process, suggesting confirmation is needed.
- **Functionality vs Speed in Kernel Production**: A co-author noted that merely producing functionally correct kernels does not imply they meet performance benchmarks, as speed is a critical metric.
   - While functional correctness is achievable because of existing reference kernels, the real goal is for model-generated kernels to outperform current implementations.
