- **Dataset Dilemma for DiscoResearch**: Participant considers using **Mistral** for a project but faces challenges with a small dataset size of 3k entries, leading to concerns about overfitting as the model quickly memorizes the data.
- **Loss Concerns Downplayed**: Another member reassures that a significant drop in loss is normal regardless of dataset size, highlighting that it happens even with 100k examples.
- **Understanding Training Loss**: Following an inquiry on what constitutes 'good loss' post-epoch, it is stated that the absolute loss value during Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) is not a reliable performance indicator, but should generally be below 2.
- **Exploring Orpo, Not SFT**: Clarification reveals that the focus is on **Orpo training** and not Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT), with no readily available experience values to benchmark expected loss.
- **Seeking Data and Collaboration**: To counter data scarcity, plans to mix German dataset with **arilla dpo 7k mix dataset** are discussed, and an invitation for collaboration on the side project is extended.
