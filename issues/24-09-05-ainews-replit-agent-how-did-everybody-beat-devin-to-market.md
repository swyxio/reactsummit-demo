A packed day. The annual [Time 100 AI outrage](https://x.com/time/status/1831665580241293772?s=46) piece. [Maitai](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41456552), [AnythingLLM](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41457633), [Laminar](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41451698) launched. [Melodio - new text-to-music model](https://x.com/mjlbach/status/1831323536788791595?s=46). Together ai announced [some kernel work]( https://x.com/togethercompute/status/1831783919718690877?s=46) and [speculative decoding work](https://x.com/togethercompute/status/1831755763615674412).

If you've been paying attention to the coding agent company launches - like Claude Artifacts, [Cursor Composer](https://x.com/shaoruu/status/1812412514350858634), [Val.town Townie](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41322818), [Cosie Genie](https://www.latent.space/p/cosine), [Honeycomb](https://x.com/snowmaker/status/1831219441327394886), and even [the You.com pivot yesterday](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-1150m-for-ssi-sakana-youcom-claude-500m/), this is pretty much what you'd expect Replit to do, just very very well executed - full text to running app generation with planning and [self healing](https://x.com/frankismartinez/status/1831766482642202881). What's laudable is the **lack of waitlist** - it is live today to paid users - and can deploy on a live URL with postgres backend, from [people who cannot code](https://x.com/emollick/status/1831855794356379914), including [on your phone](https://x.com/amasad/status/1831759801736626341). Of course, Replit Agent [can even make a Replit clone](https://x.com/amasad/status/1831858971847880873).

There are unfortunately no benchmarks or even blogposts to write about. Which makes our job simple. Watch video, try it, or scroll on.

> - `Performance Insights on Batch Sizes`
> - `Autotune Configurations from PyTorch`
> - `Triton Code Limitations with GROUP_M`
> - `GemV Implementation Challenges`
> - `Memory-Bound Performance Analysis` 


- **Performance Insights on Batch Sizes**: Up to batch size **16-32**, the speed-up remains consistent as it utilizes 1 **16x16** / **8x32** tensor core instruction, but slows down afterwards while maintaining close to **1x** at higher batch sizes.
   - Mobicham noted that with more autotune parameters, there's potential for improved speed.
- **Autotune Configurations from PyTorch**: A member shared **extra autotune configs** found in the PyTorch repository, useful for **int8 mm** challenges.
   - These configs can potentially aid Mobicham's performance tests, particularly in optimizing tensor core usage.
- **Triton Code Limitations with GROUP_M**: Mobicham indicated that reducing **GROUP_M** below **8** could negatively affect performance due to restrictions in `tl.dot` supporting only specific tensor core shapes.
   - The assertion error received when using lesser shapes highlights the challenge in achieving efficient implementations.
- **GemV Implementation Challenges**: After struggling with a good **gemv** implementation in Triton, Mobicham switched to **CUDA**, leading to the development of **GemLite**.
   - Testing showed that using multiply + add was feasible, but ultimately, performance was subpar compared to using `tl.dot`.
- **Memory-Bound Performance Analysis**: The performance when using advanced configuration settings remains slower in **memory-bound setups** yet achieves speeds close to **FP16** with large batches.
   - This is particularly beneficial for large context prefill and training, indicating effective overall progress.

- **Compile errors when using PyTorch 2.4**: Members reported compile errors with the latest main on PyTorch 2.4, especially issues with fake tensors. It was noted that using `os.environ['TORCH_COMPILE_BACKEND'] = 'aot_eager'` might hide these errors in CI.
   - One member suggested a potential CI issue regarding testing with the default backend, hinting at a need for CI workers to install a newer version of gcc.
- **Performance impact of input padding**: One member did a test run with input padding using the default config on the Alpaca dataset and found a significant speed hit. They noted that while memory footprint improved due to less fragmentation, the performance optimization was not as beneficial.
   - Another member suggested that reporting both padded and unpadded tokens could provide insights into the waste from padding, emphasizing that padded tokens are still processed.
- **Memory footprint considerations**: Discussion about memory management led to insights on better memory footprint and implications for OOM issues during training. Using expandable segments did not seem to resolve memory hikes for larger sequence lengths.
   - Members highlighted that reserved memory is crucial for avoiding OOM, and one noted a bump in memory likely corresponds with increases in sequence length.
- **Need for CI testing standards**: There was a suggestion to open a separate issue regarding CI testing for torch.compile with the default backend due to inconsistent error reporting. This topic has since been revisited in the context of existing GitHub issues.
   - Engagement around CI standards included discussion about setting up an environment to better reproduce issues faced with PyTorch versions.

- **Llama-3.1-8B transforms into Molecular Design Engine**: Fine-tuning and DPO successfully turned **Llama-3.1-8B** into a powerful model for generating molecules based on specified properties, demonstrating its capability in molecular design.
   - This technique allows users to produce molecules on-demand by providing a few hints about their desired characteristics.
- **SFT and DPO create revolutionary Chemical Language Model**: A study revealed that a Large Language Model (LLM) can function as a **Chemical Language Model (CLM)** when trained using **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)** and **direct preference optimization (DPO)**.
   - This approach enables the LLM to generate molecules relevant to drug development, achieving performance comparable to CLMs reliant solely on chemical data.
- **Excitement over new molecular design capabilities**: *That sounds sick!*
   - Members expressed enthusiasm over the potential of this fine-tuned model and considered sharing it widely on social media.
- **SmileyLlama's debut on social media**: The model, dubbed **SmileyLlama**, is a Chemical Language Model designed to create molecules from property prompts and has garnered attention on X.
   - A post from the Axolotl account highlighted that it stands **on par with other pure CLMs**, while utilizing the Axolotl framework.
- **Upcoming accessibility for testing**: There is anticipation for the arrival of the HF model, allowing members to engage with the fine-tuned Llama model directly.
   - This follows the recent advancements in using Llama for chemical tasks, indicating a move toward broader accessibility.
