<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->Fun to meet some of you at [the Nous Research launch](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1732592248955740179) last night.

We've added Wing Lian's discord to this tracker, and will be recording a pod with him today.

Anthropic "[went ahead and fixed the glitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUE0PPQI3is)" by [adding a prompt](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2-1-prompting) to Greg Kamradt's needle in a haystack test: ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/67b252e1-cd21-4769-8e13-53ac18103bab.png?w=960&fit=max) 

In other news, Schmidhuber wants to [remind you](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI/status/1732430359969571014) he's always been right.

- **Discussing Model Training and Custom Datasets**: `@faldore` was sharing insights regarding the training of the **Dolphin** model, inspired by Microsoft Orca and focused on uncensored text, which includes samples from Airoboros and Samantha. For Dolphin 3.0, the creator plans to replace these with a new conversation-centered dataset. They mentioned they're working on an open-source implementation of the Orca 2 dataset.

- **Possible Collaboration on Higher Context Models**: Users `@rtyax` and `@kaltcit` expressed interest in training **Yi-200K** models with higher context counts. `@kaltcit` stated they have a model targeting academic and QA use, emphasizing that it would not be useful for jokes/stories/raps as it's not trained on Airobo/Dolphin datasets.

- **Advantages of Large Batch Sizes**: During a discussion on training models, `@kaltcit` explained that larger batch sizes could help deal with unexpected loss increase in the middle of training. Larger batches also allow for a higher learning rate, which can lead to lower losses.

- **Training Resources and Recommendations**: `@faldore` advised `@kaltcit` to form an LLC and apply for Microsoft's Startup program to obtain Azure credits for training. `@kaltcit` mentioned they already had unlimited research credits with Google for their GCP A100 US central quotas.

- **Troubleshooting Model Launching**: `@papr_airplane` shared issues launching **BakLLaVA-1** due to non-consecutive token issues. `@nanobitz` suggested manually fixing this by adjusting the `tokenizer_config`.

- **Discussion about Integrating PEFT and AWQ**: 
    - `@caseus_` queried whether fixes in **PEFT** should be upstreamed, or if **autoawq** could be added as an install extras. 
    - `@casper_ai` proposed adding **AWQ** to the requirements and provided code snippet for incorporating AWQ with PEFT: `import awq.modules.peft_patch`.
    - `@caseus_` confirmed the necessity of adding **AWQ** to the requirements.
    - `@casper_ai` suggested using the **AWQ** version from **PyPi** which ships with **CUDA 12.1** over the one on **GitHub** with **CUDA 11.8**, as PyPi tends to simplify the process.


### ▷ #[axolotl-help](https://discord.com/channels/1104757954588196865/1111279858136383509/) (36 messages🔥): 
        
- **Issues with flash-attn versions**: User `@casper_ai` reported experiencing issues when using `flash-attn==2.3.6` with the standard RunPod template with torch 2.1.1 and cuda 12.1.1. The issue was resolved by downgrading to `flash-attn==2.3.3`.
  
- **Issues with NCCL timeout**: User `@vijen.` queried how to disable the nccl timeout that was encountered when running the `train` command after preprocessing. `@caseus_` suggested checking out resources on handling NCCL issues in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl/blob/main/docs/nccl.md) and mentioned recent updates on the `accelerate` library that might solve the issues.
  
- **Increased inference time post model merger**: `@DavidG88` noticed a significant increase in inference time after merging QLoRA adapter with a `7b Mistral` base model using `axolotl`. The issue was specifically prominent when benchmarking the models using `llm-evaluation-harness`.

- **Prompt formats for ShareGPT**: `@mave_2k` asked about the prompt format for ShareGPT interfacing with a trained model. `@tim9422` provided instructions, sharing links to relevant parts of the code. He also warned about inconsistency issues with an extra line break in the ChatML separator and offered to create a PR to fix it.

- **Recommendations for Inference Tools**: When asked about recommended tools for running inference, `@nanobitz` recommended using `ooba`.

Remember that these are third-party suggestions based on personal experience. Always test different solutions and choose what works best for your use case.

- **Double token inclusion in dataset format**: `@dirisala` noticed that when using the "completion" dataset format with llama based models, the framework was adding `<s>` token at the beginning even though it was already in the dataset. This was resulting in the token being included twice. 
- **Potential solution to double token issue**: `@nanobitz` suggested removing it from the dataset prior to processing and added that the inclusion of tokens like `<s>` is based on the tokenizer used. 
- **DolphinCoder dataset**: `@faldore` shared a link to the **DolphinCoder** dataset on Hugging Face and mentioned plans to train a model on it.
- **Coding-multiturn dataset**: `@faldore` expressed the need for a good coding-multiturn dataset, suggesting that the sharedGPT dataset might be filtered for coding related conversations.
- **Retro-YahooAnswers dataset**: `@visuallyadequate` posted a link to a new dataset called **Retro-YahooAnswers** from Yahoo Answers circa 2007, but warned that the dataset contained sensitive content and might not be a good dataset for serious assistant models, except perhaps as seed data for a synthetic dataset.

- **Tokenizer Modification**: User `@geronimi73` asked how to add new tokens to a model. `@nanobitz` clarified that if the model uses the HF tokenizer, one can add tokens within the config yaml file.

- **Impression on Mamba 130m Instruct Model**: User `_automagic` shared a link to the **mamba 130m instruct** model which is hosted on **Hugging Face**, praising its impressive performance.

- **Troubleshooting for Model Training**: `@faldore` trained a model (*yi-34b*) and shared observations about an unexpected peak at 4k in the loss, despite using deepspeed and AdamW optimizer. `@casper_ai` suggested enabling the `--debug` mode to capture logs and identify potential issues.

- An observed decline in the performance of **GPT-4 Turbo** with reduced quality of outputs, unrelated to speed. 
- Discussions on **Anthropic's Claude 2.1 prompting** and its performance improvement by modifying prompts. A significant score increase was seen by adding "Here is the most relevant sentence in the context:" to Claude 2.1's responses. The frequent use of the term "skill issue" by the Anthropics staff was noted and discussed. *"[Anthropic's Claude 2.1 Prompting](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2-1-prompting)*" blog post was shared as a reference.
- Request for resources or practices to reduce inference costs in **GPT-4** by using cheaper models for summarization or re-ranking was raised without a conclusive discussion on the matter. A related resource, a tweet from Leonie (@helloiamleonie), showcased how prompt engineering could enhance accuracy.
- Seek for advice on implementing **speech-to-text APIs** in January was raised without providing a clear solution.
- The complexities of human evaluation in the training of models were discussed, with an emphasis on the creation of *rating guidelines* which replicated the rating tasks performed by **OpenAI's RLHF**.
- A discussion was initiated regarding **optimal prompt structure with large context** like LangChain's base prompts for retrieval QA and an experiment by Anthropic on Claude2.1's prompting structure. However, the impact of the shift remains unclear.
- Proposal of hosting **mini demo days** for prompting madness at some IRL events plus a recommendation for the [Luma event](https://lu.ma/eaccmonthly) and an invitation to the **e/acc summit** at Gigi's Hoxton, London were shared.
- Discussion on **ChatGPT Plus invitation**, where members can invite others using their invitation codes. Each member gets up to 3 invitations. Concerns were raised about the Assistant API's delay affecting user experience due to the lack of streaming capability.
- Interest in understanding the benchmark on prompt word length, optimal structure for document extraction tasks, and experience with medical case extraction. A novel synthetic benchmarking idea for **LLM Quality Measurement** was shared, though the original paper's link was invalid.
