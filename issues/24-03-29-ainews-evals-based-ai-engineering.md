<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 3/27/2024-3/29/2024. We checked 5 subreddits and [**364** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **25** Discords (**377** channels, and **5415** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **615 minutes**.

Evals are the "eat your vegetables" of AI engineering - everyone knows they should just do more of it:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b87d3db1-c544-4a8c-ad8a-f1b65e7f9156.png?w=960&fit=max) 

**Hamel Husain** has yet another banger in his blog series: [Your AI Product Needs Evals](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/):

> Like software engineering, success with AI hinges on how fast you can iterate. You must have processes and tools for:
> 
> 1. Evaluating quality (ex: tests).
> 1. Debugging issues (ex: logging & inspecting data).
> 1. Changing the behavior or the system (prompt eng, fine-tuning, writing code)
>
> **Many people focus exclusively on #3 above**, which prevents them from improving their LLM products beyond a demo. **Doing all three activities well creates a virtuous cycle** differentiating great from mediocre AI products (see the diagram below for a visualization of this cycle).

We are guilty of this at AINews - our loop is slow and hence the product improvement pace has also been much slower than we would want to see. Hamel proposes a mental model to center on evals:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1ff2d80f-b60e-4067-94eb-8bf4e1470972.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Excerpts we liked:

- **You must remove all friction from the process of looking at data.**
- **Many vendors want to sell you tools that claim to eliminate the need for a human to look at the data.** but **You should track the correlation between model-based and human evaluation to decide how much you can rely on automatic evaluation**.
- **Eval Systems Unlock Superpowers For Free**. In addition to iterating fast, having good evals unlock the ability to finetune and synthesize data.

The post has a lot of practical advice on how to make these "sensible things" easy, like using spreadsheets for hand labeling or hooking up LangSmith (which doesn't require LangChain).

**Obligatory AI Safety PSA**: OpenAI today released some samples of [their rumored Voice Engine](https://openai.com/blog/navigating-the-challenges-and-opportunities-of-synthetic-voices) taking a 15s voice samples and successfully translating to different domains and languages. It's a nice demo and is great marketing for HeyGen, but more importantly they are trying to warn us that very very good voice cloning from small samples is here. Take [Noam's word](https://twitter.com/polynoamial/status/1773799870890918358) for it (who is at OpenAI but not on the voice team):

**Eleuther ▷ #[interpretability-general](https://discord.com/channels/729741769192767510/1052314805576400977/1222915547465912340)** (40 messages🔥): 

- **Weight Wonders or Woes?**: Discrepancies were identified when comparing weight parameters between **Transformer Lens** (`tl`) and **Hugging Face** (`hf`) versions of models like GPT-2 and Pythia 70m. The examination of these discrepancies involved comparing shapes and computing the maximum absolute differences between the models' embedding parameters.

- **A Feature, Not a Bug**: The variation in model weights was initially thought to be a bug but was confirmed to be a featured processing step by Transformer Lens. The solution advised was to use `from_pretrained_no_processing` when initializing models to avoid such pre-processing. References were made to a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/issues/346) and [further comments on weight processing](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/further_comments.md#weight-processing).

- **Logit Labyrinths**: Despite same-shaped logits showing significant absolute differences between `nn_model` and `tl_nn_model`, a comparison after applying softmax indicated negligible differences—the implication being that while raw logit values differ, the relative order and softmax outputs are consistent.

- **A Plotting Pathway to Clarification**: The process of identifying and understanding the weight disparities involved plotting various matrices, including the embedding matrices and their absolute differences, and analyzing their characteristics.

- **Sparse Autoencoders Under Scrutiny**: A separate mention highlighted a research post discussing the impact of reconstruction errors in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), suggesting that these errors could significantly alter model predictions more than random errors of equal magnitude. The post is accessible via a [LessWrong link](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rZPiuFxESMxCDHe4B/sae-reconstruction-errors-are-empirically-pathological).
