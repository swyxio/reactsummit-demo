**CUDA MODE ▷ #[triton](https://discord.com/channels/1189498204333543425/1189607595451895918/1234899266837938176)** (13 messages🔥): 

- **Triton's Block Size Puzzle**: A member inquired about the maximum block size in **Triton**, thinking it would match CUDA's limit. In response, it was explained that Triton's block size is not fundamentally tied to the hardware and could theoretically be very large, with no direct relation to the number of threads launched per block.

- **Triton Debugging Techniques Probed**: An individual sought advice on the best practices for debugging **Triton** kernels, finding challenges with `TRITON_INTERPRET=1` and `device_print`. Another member encouraged reviewing a [Triton debugging lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdTsX6DQk24) for insights, as it might provide useful strategies.

- **Need for Triton Interpreter Bug Fixes**: Following up on debugging issues, a user mentioned that the `TRITON_INTERPRET=1` setting was causing abnormal program behavior. It was suggested to install **Triton** from source or use `triton-nightly` to benefit from recent interpreter bug fixes.

- **Curiosity for Triton's Release Schedule**: A member asked about the expected release date for the next version of **Triton**, as they are currently using version 2.3. The response was that there is no solid plan yet for the upcoming release.

**CUDA MODE ▷ #[cuda](https://discord.com/channels/1189498204333543425/1189607726595194971/1234762936782819398)** (14 messages🔥): 

- **Exploring CUTLASS vs CuBLAS**: A member highlighted the performance of [CUTLASS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass), which outperformed CuBLAS with a matrix multiplication benchmark (8192 x 8192 x 8192), achieving 288 Teraflops compared to CuBLAS's 258 Teraflops. When integrated into Python, however, CUTLASS's performance advantage disappeared, matching CuBLAS at 257 Teraflops.
- **Kernel Timing Conundrums in CUDA**: A discussion emerged around accurately profiling time durations within CUDA kernels, as utilizing `cudaEventRecord` showed unstable timings, particularly in shared memory versions of matrix multiply kernels with varying tile sizes.
- **NVIDIA Tools for Accurate Profiling**: It was suggested to use NVIDIA's `nsight compute` or `nsight system` for more robust profiling, as they are built to be more accurate and might incur less overhead compared to custom profiling with `cudaEventRecord`.
- **Understanding Profiling Overheads**: A member queried about inconsistencies between `cudaEventRecord` timings and `ncu's` Duration field, with the concern that `ncu's` report might include profiling overhead. The response clarified that `ncu` runs warm-up kernels which could account for additional reported time, but ultimately suggest more accuracy.
- **Nsight Systems vs. NCU Utility**: Clarification was given that both `nsys` and `ncu` can be used for profiling CUDA kernels, with each providing different utilities and interfaces for analyzing and understanding kernel performance.

- **Sparsity and Quality Trade-offs**: The conversation revolves around an algorithm potentially leveraging *batch size=1 activation sparsity*, which might preserve compute and quality. However, there is concern that this approach could face limitations similar to activation sparsity when dealing with batched computations over one.
  
- **Effort Creator Chimes In**: The creator of the algorithm mentioned joined the chat and is open to discussing their findings about its performance.

- **Benchmark Revelations**: The creator provided an update that new benchmarks show *effort/bucketMul* performs worse in terms of speed/quality ratio when compared to quantization, with an article to come detailing these findings.

- **Quality Keeps Up with Pruning**: Despite speed/quality concerns, the creator claimed that in terms of quality degradation, their method appears superior to simply pruning the smallest weights, promising to post supporting charts.

- **Direct Comparison Shared**: A direct comparison was shared highlighting the difference between removing the lowest weights from a matrix and skipping the least important calculations, noting the creator's ongoing process of learning about sparsity.

**CUDA MODE ▷ #[llmdotc](https://discord.com/channels/1189498204333543425/1227345713348870156/1234762607689203752)** (809 messages🔥🔥🔥): 

- **CUDA Optimization Discussions Intensify**: The CUDA MODE Discord community continues to scrutinize and optimize various kernel operations. Members are experimenting with aligning tensor strides and optimizing the *matmul_backward_bias* kernel, with an eye on future enhancements using *x128* packing for increased performance. Several iterations have been proposed for the *gradient clipping* and *adam optimizer* kernels, considering their impacts on computational efficiency and memory usage.
- **CUDA Graphs and cuDNN Flash Attention in Action**: The channel's contributors have successfully integrated optional support for cuDNN flash attention, seeing meaningful speed improvements, although the exact performance gain over current bespoke kernels remains under evaluation. CUDA graphs have been mentioned as a mechanism for optimization, though more detail is needed to understand their current state of use within the community's codebase.
- **Comparing PyTorch and llm.c Performance**: Recent discussions and benchmarks suggest that *llm.c* is closely matching or surpassing the performance of PyTorch for the GPT-2 model training, even outperforming PyTorch 2.3.0 by up to 32%. However, with PyTorch nightly builds showing considerable performance improvements due to recently merged PRs, *llm.c* is now slightly behind with a ~4% slower token processing rate.
- **Debates Over Memory Efficiency and Operation Fusing**: There's ongoing discussion about the relative merits of fusing operations like GELU with matmul kernels to save memory. Though such fusion is tricky and could potentially hurt performance, some suggest fusing into the epilogue of the preceding matmul or re-computing in backward passes could be a memory-efficient compromise. Concepts like prologue vs. epilogue fusion and matmul's need for input/output tiles in forward/backward passes are central to these debates.
- **Potential for Master Weights in FP32**: A suggestion was made to keep master weights in FP32 by default to provide a more stable and reliable implementation. This modification would imply certain changes to the optimizer update function and memory allocation scheme, with lazy initialization during the update stage as a possible approach.

**Unsloth AI (Daniel Han) ▷ #[general](https://discord.com/channels/1179035537009545276/1179035537529643040/1234773459733708810)** (572 messages🔥🔥🔥): 

- **Efficiency vs. Power Debate**: The A4000 16GB GPU was highlighted as efficient for training, costing significantly lower than an A100 per hour. The upcoming B200 is pegged as a game-changer, potentially 25x more efficient than an H100 at a similar price point. 

- **Finetuning With LoRA and QLoRA**: A discussion clarified the differences in VRAM usage and potential accuracy degradation between using LoRA (16bit) and QLoRA (4bit). QLoRA saves 75% of VRAM but might result in 1-2% accuracy loss, whereas LoRA has no accuracy degradation.

- **Training Advice Shared**: A recommended strategy was to split datasets into 80% for training, 10% for tuning hyperparameters, and keep 10% hidden for final model evaluation without further tuning to avoid contaminating training data.

- **Training Turkish Language Model**: A user is fine-tuning Llama 3 on translate tasks for Turkish with over 430k examples. The model is currently performing like a translation bot, changing the output language based on the input language.

- **ORPO Training on Unsloth**: A snippet of code was shared for training the mlabonne/orpo-dpo-mix-40k dataset using Unsloth ORPO Trainer on an RTX 4090 GPU, taking about 5 hours.

- **VRAM Misreading Spotted**: A member mentioned that **LM Studio** is incorrectly reading the **VRAM capacity** of their 7900xtx. They also have a 7800x3d with integrated GPU, but doubt it's causing the issue.
- **Performance Precedent Creates Confusion**: Despite having used a **RX 6600** with LM Studio GPU offloading before, a member faces an error stating "no ROCm-capable device is detected" after updating to version 0.2.18. This elicits discussion about support for ROCm and OpenCL implementations with various AMD GPUs.
- **HIP SDK Support Misconceptions Clarified**: Members exchanged information about the **compatibility of different AMD GPUs with ROCm and the HIP SDK**, stating that graphics cards like the RX 6600 and 6700XT are not supported by the HIP SDK which LM Studio utilizes.
- **Lamenting GPU Support on LM Studio**: While one member considered upgrading to a 7900 GRE, another advised that they would **be better off with a 7900XTX** for guaranteed compatibility with LM Studio's ROCm build. The **price difference** between models in their country sparked a humorous suggestion of a budget flight for hardware shopping.
- **Searching for Linux-Specific ROCm Builds**: The conversation revealed that **there is no ROCm build for Linux**, prompting a mention of Mozilla's work on **llamafile** as a potential workaround for issues related to AMD's driver support.

- **Exploring the Computational Model of Sequence-Prediction**: A member theorized about the computational model learned by sequence-prediction models, particularly related to next-token prediction loss, predicting the existence of phase transitions in token probabilities and seeking feedback on their write-up [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11w3of15CbfOlWrvQpTjxaJt-UvtOckzr0WQUfTrTnsw/edit?usp=sharing).

- **Connecting Prior Work with Theoretical Predictions**: The member acknowledged the relevance of existing research on transformers and iterative inference, notably the *tuned lens* method from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08112), and discussed how findings from early decoding align with their proposed theory.

- **Discussing Model Representations with Tied Embeddings**: Dialogue ensued about how models with tied embeddings, like Mamba, might affect interpretation, with speculation that tied embeddings could actually benefit the model’s representational coherence.

- **Drafting Implementation Plans for Theoretical Predictions**: In response to whether implementations have been considered to test the hypotheses, a discussion took place about possibly using *transformer lens* and *gpt-2-small* to conduct experiments.

- **Exchanging Interpretability Insights**: Members exchanged views on the challenges of defining and operationalizing the "atomicity" of model features. References were made to emerging concepts like the *distributional simplicity bias* and the *Quantization Model* of neural scaling laws, linking to research papers [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04362) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13506).

- **Refining Interpretability Methods with Formal Languages**: A suggestion was made to define an arbitrary formal grammar and train a network on sequences from that language to determine if the rules of the grammar could be considered the “true underlying features,” investigating transformers' understandings of Dyck languages as a pertinent angle.
