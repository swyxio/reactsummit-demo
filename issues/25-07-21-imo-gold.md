description: >-
  **OpenAI** and **Google DeepMind** achieved a major milestone by solving 5 out
  of 6 problems at the **International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 2025** within
  the human time limit of 4.5 hours, earning the IMO Gold medal. This
  breakthrough was accomplished using general-purpose reinforcement learning and
  pure in-weights reasoning without specialized tools or internet access,
  surpassing previous systems like AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry2. The success
  resolved a 3-year-old AI bet on AI's capability to solve IMO problems and
  sparked discussions among mathematicians including **Terence Tao**. Despite
  this, 26 human competitors remain better than AI on the hardest combinatorics
  problem (P6). The achievement highlights advances in
  **reinforcement-learning**, **reasoning**, and **model-scaling** in AI
  research.

This time last year, GDM announced that [AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry2](https://news.smol.ai/issues/24-07-25-ainews-alphaproof-alphageometry2-reach-1-point-short-of-imo-gold) (the latest in a [long series of Alpha* work](https://x.com/deedydas/status/1946987560875766212)) had perfectly solved 4 out of the 6 IMO 2024 problems, falling 1 point short of the Gold medal cutoff. However that system needed over 60 hours for some problems, much longer than the 4.5 hours allowed for humans.

This year, both OpenAI ("an experimental research model, not released in GPT5" - [their solutions here](https://github.com/aw31/openai-imo-2025-proofs/)) and GDM ("[Advanced version of Gemini Deep Think](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/)" - [their solutions here](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/IMO_2025.pdf)) announced* full solves of 5 out of the 6 problems ([P6 is typically the hardest](https://x.com/ErnestRyu/status/1946698896375492746)) all within 4.5 hours, achieving IMO Gold and resolving a [3 year old AI bet between Paul Christiano and Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.notion.so/really-delete-1cc3eeb8e42a8082891cf977ab364a0f?pvs=21), where Paul had put the probability at <4% in Feb 2022. Interestingly, the market estimated probability of this success trended *DOWN* even through the release of o1 and new reasoner models, and only shot up to 50-80% after the GDM announcement last year:

The even more surprising element of this Gold prize not documented by that bet is that it was done **WITHOUT** use of specialized tools like Lean or even access to the Internet; just pure in-weights reasoning (aka "[purely via search in token space](https://x.com/fchollet/status/1947337944215523567)"):

Mathematicians seem mostly [unthreatened](https://x.com/ErnestRyu/status/1946700798001574202) and are welcoming the result, although [Terence Tao had some strong doubts about methdology and medal claim](https://x.com/pli_cachete/status/1946692267915304991?s=46) (which were [answered](https://x.com/BorisMPower/status/1946859525270859955)).

Thanks to the combinatorics problem P6 that requires creativity, In 2025, [26 humans](https://x.com/damekdavis/status/1947357679040569520/photo/1) remain better than AI at the IMO. [Try it](https://x.com/deedydas/status/1946250774960537927) if you wish.

# AI Twitter Recap

**AI Achieves IMO Gold: The Race, Results, and Reaction**

- **OpenAI and Google DeepMind both announce Gold Medal performance on the International Math Olympiad (IMO)**: **OpenAI** was first to announce, with [@gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1946479692485431465) and [@polynoamial](https://twitter.com/polynoamial/status/1946526143433015349) detailing that an **experimental reasoning LLM** solved **5 of 6** problems under the same rules as humans (4.5 hours, no tools), producing **natural language proofs**. Shortly after, **Google DeepMind** announced that an advanced version of **Gemini Deep Think** also achieved a **gold-medal score of 35/42**, with the result being officially validated by IMO judges, as shared by [@fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1947337944215523567) and [@koraykv](https://twitter.com/koraykv/status/1947335096740049112). [@YiTayML](https://twitter.com/YiTayML/status/1947350087941951596) noted that this general deep think model will be shipped to users in the future.
- **Community Reaction and Scrutiny**: The announcements sparked significant discussion and some controversy. [@SebastienBubeck](https://twitter.com/SebastienBubeck/status/1946577650405056722) called it a **"moon-landing moment"** for AI, highlighting that a next-word prediction machine produced genuinely creative proofs. However, [@Mihonarium](https://twitter.com/Mihonarium/status/1947072974621982839) reported that the IMO had asked AI companies to wait a week before announcing results to avoid overshadowing the human participants. This led to criticism of **OpenAI's** timing, particularly after **Google DeepMind** waited for official confirmation, a move that [@Yuchenj_UW](https://twitter.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/1947339774257402217) stated "wins my respect." Further analysis by [@lmthang](https://twitter.com/lmthang/status/1946960256439058844) clarified that without the official marking guideline, a medal claim is not final, and a one-point deduction would result in a **Silver, not Gold**. An independent analysis of LLMs on the **2025 IMO** from the **MathArena** team was also shared by [@hardmaru](https://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/1946942279807308210).
- **The "AGI Bar" Debate**: The IMO achievement has led to a renewed debate on what milestones signify progress towards AGI. [@DrJimFan](https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1946593477460189340) argues that the **"Physical Turing Test"**, such as an AI cooking dinner in any kitchen, is a harder problem due to **Moravec's paradox**. This sentiment was echoed by [@jxmnop](https://twitter.com/jxmnop/status/1946675650686746879), who joked that AI can achieve this mathematical feat but still can't reliably book a trip to Boston. Conversely, [@*aidan_clark*](https://twitter.com/_aidan_clark_/status/1947178461765775510) sets the bar at the replacement of all human labor by **nanobot swarms**.

**New Models, Architectures, and Performance**

- **Qwen3-235B-A22B Release and Architecture**: **Alibaba's** Qwen team released an updated **Qwen3-235B-A22B**, a non-reasoning model that [@huybery](https://twitter.com/huybery/status/1947345040470380614) says shows significant improvements. [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1947350866840748521) notes it now beats reasoning models like **Kimi-K2**, **Claude-4 Opus**, and **DeepSeek V3** on benchmarks like **GPQA**, **AIME**, and **ARC-AGI**. [@rasbt](https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1947393814496190712) provided a detailed technical breakdown, comparing its architecture to **Kimi 2**: **Qwen3** is **4.25x** smaller overall, has fewer active parameters (**22B** vs. **32B**), and uses **128** experts per MoE layer versus Kimi's **384**.
- **Kimi K2 Technical Report and Performance**: The **Kimi K2** technical report was released, revealing details about the **~1T parameter** model, as shared by [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1947384137892966693). Community members like [@pashmerepat](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1946389822043504745) noted that on real-world tasks (not benchmarks), telemetry shows **Kimi K2** outperforming **Gemini**.
- **GPT-5 Rumors and Model Routers**: [@Yuchenj_UW](https://twitter.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/1946777842131632427) shared rumors that **GPT-5** will not be a single model but a system of multiple models with a router that switches between reasoning, non-reasoning, and tool-using variants. This sparked discussion, with [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1946903963200262523) expressing a preference for manual model selection over an automatic router to avoid compute-saving measures that could degrade performance for pro users.
- **Architectural Reviews and Other Model Updates**: [@rasbt](https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1946549778319339931) published a comprehensive review of 2025's major LLM architectures, covering **DeepSeek-V3**, **Kimi 2**, and techniques like **Multi-head Latent Attention**, **NoPE**, and **shared-expert MoEs**. **Microsoft** open-sourced the pre-training code for **Phi-4-mini-Flash**, a SoTA hybrid model, as highlighted by [@algo_diver](https://twitter.com/algo_diver/status/1946397862767767921).

The platform features **Generative UI**, which creates interactive cards on the fly for tasks like sending emails or joining calendar invites, shifting Perplexity from an "ask anything" to a ["do anything" company](https://twitter.com/AravSrinivas/status/1947175881203683577). The product has seen rapid adoption, with [@AravSrinivas](https://twitter.com/AravSrinivas/status/1947173109083332988) noting its browser now ranks above Wikipedia's Comet page on Google search results.
- **Cline's Open Source Strategy and Incentive Alignment**: [@cline](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1946704096888533005) published a detailed thread explaining their decision to open-source their AI coding assistant and not resell inference. By separating the "harness" from the "model calls," they argue their incentives are aligned with the user's goal of getting maximum capability, as they can't degrade performance to improve margins.
- **New Tools and Developer Integrations**: A new CLI tool called `gut` was released, acting as an AI agent for git that translates natural language into git commands, highlighted by [@jerryjliu0](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1947026118260949146). The adoption of `llms.txt` continues, with [@jeremyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1946386696691683473) sharing its implementation in the **Gemini API docs** to create model-friendly documentation. **Hugging Face Inference Providers** are now fully **OpenAI client compatible**, as announced by [@reach_vb](https://twitter.com/reach_vb/status/1946499807159226445).
- **Agent Design and Frameworks**: [@jerryjliu0](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1946358807875244398) shared best practices for crafting structured output schemas for LLMs, such as limiting nesting depth and using optional fields. **LangChain** announced it is working towards a **v1.0 release**, which will feature revamped docs and general agent architectures built on **LangGraph**, according to [@hwchase17](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1947376920355917909).

**AI Research, Infrastructure, and Technical Concepts**

- **GPU Infrastructure and Optimization**: [@tri_dao](https://twitter.com/tri_dao/status/1947188520340398200) noted that the hierarchical layout of **CuTe** (part of **CUTLASS 3.x**) is a powerful abstraction for high-performance GPU kernels and was the inspiration for rewriting **FlashAttention 2**. The **vLLM** project highlighted the importance of **prefix caching** for agentic workflows, noting it is enabled by default with an efficient implementation to improve performance for append-only contexts [@vllm_project](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/1946575947295322171).
- **The Product Management Bottleneck**: In a widely shared post, [@AndrewYNg](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg/status/1947308544916889979) introduced the concept of the **"Product Management Bottleneck,"** arguing that as agentic coding accelerates development, the new bottleneck becomes deciding *what* to build. He advocates for PMs who can use data to refine their gut instincts and make high-quality product decisions quickly.
- **Core AI Concepts and Papers**: **François Chollet** offered a definition of intelligence, stating it is not a collection of skills but **the efficiency with which you acquire and deploy new skills**, making benchmark scores potentially misleading [@fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1946668452045029861). A comprehensive **160+ page survey on Context Engineering** was shared by [@omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1946660448742343013). [@francoisfleuret](https://twitter.com/francoisfleuret/status/1947026623968244008) argued that the principle of **"denoising"**—creating order from chaos by reversing degradation—is a powerful and fundamental concept that can take AI anywhere.
- **Open Source Datasets**: The **Hermes 3** dataset from **Nous Research** became the #1 trending dataset on Hugging Face, as celebrated by [@Teknium1](https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1946824832764785135) and the Nous team.

[@xikun_zhang_](https://twitter.com/xikun_zhang_/status/1946813185958510613) described the intense, focused culture at **OpenAI**, where a talented team repeatedly executes "like a small startup" to ship products like the ChatGPT agent in just over two months.
- **US vs. China in Open Source AI**: The AI community noted the strong performance of Chinese models, with [@bigeagle_xd](https://twitter.com/bigeagle_xd/status/1946426600838586476) pointing out the top 4 open models are from China. [@DaniYogatama](https://twitter.com/DaniYogatama/status/1947087827721912485) provided a structural analysis of why the US is lagging in open-source models, citing a lack of backing from hyperscalers for new labs and organizational issues in large US companies. This was echoed by [@francoisfleuret](https://twitter.com/francoisfleuret/status/1946817554967626176), who contrasted the West's "blasé" attitude toward engineering with China's enthusiasm.
- **The Business of AI and Founder Incentives**: [@c_valenzuelab](https://twitter.com/c_valenzuelab/status/1947309109902037056) described a market transition from **"pay for the process" to "pay for the results,"** where AI agents can deliver outcomes like video ads or websites immediately, opening up markets to businesses that couldn't afford traditional agency processes. [@random_walker](https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/1947259631257932250) gave detailed advice for a research career, emphasizing the need to pick long-term projects, build a distribution channel (e.g., social media, blogs), and treat research like a startup with multiple shots on goal.

**Humor/Memes**

- **Gary Marcus's Timing**: [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1946530148813025544) highlighted a tweet from **Gary Marcus** claiming "No pure LLM is anywhere near getting a silver medal in a math olympiad," posted just hours before **OpenAI** announced its gold-level result.
- **The Pain of AI Agents**: [@mckaywrigley](https://twitter.com/jayelmnop/status/1946432132424818943) shared a screenshot of **Claude** drawing ASCII art and running `time.sleep(28800)`, deciding it was "time to go to bed." [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1946369984009306126) pleaded for an end to "flight booking agent demos."
- **Relatable Tech Life**: [@willdepue](https://twitter.com/willdepue/status/1946656141427060816) humorously asked why compasses don't work in New York, blaming a "great chunk of magnetite below bushwick." [@inerati](https://twitter.com/inerati/status/1947049407783817424) compared slow QR code menus to a "portal to hell, where the data is actually stored." [@QuixiAI](https://twitter.com/QuixiAI/status/1946894174734684652) lamented that "vibe coding tools need to learn to use the debugger" instead of adding print statements.

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 Launch and Anticipation

- [**Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 Released!**](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/1947344511988076547) ([Score: 379, Comments: 121](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m5owi8/qwen3235ba22b2507_released/)): **Alibaba's Qwen team released Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 and its FP8 variant, shifting from their prior hybrid thinking mode to dedicated separate training for Instruct and Thinking models. This approach, informed by community feedback, reportedly yields improved overall model quality and performance on agent-oriented tasks. Technical benchmarks and release information are detailed in the [Hugging Face model card](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507), with accessible chat and download options on Qwen Chat, Hugging Face, and ModelScope.** Comments highlight that OpenAI may need to enhance safety testing in light of Qwen's progress, and there is recognition of Alibaba's leadership in advancing open-source LLMs. The discontinuation of hybrid mode is generally viewed as a positive quality-improving move.
    - The Qwen team has shifted strategy with the Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 model, now offering separate Instruct and Thinking models rather than a hybrid approach, in response to community feedback aimed at improving task specialization and quality. This release also features an FP8 variant for users prioritizing computational efficiency.
    - Benchmark results for Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 are available on its Hugging Face model card, with some users highlighting its considerable margin over Kimi and expressing interest in direct benchmarking comparisons against the latest DeepSeek May 2024 release (see https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 ).
    - A technical highlight is the model's native context length of 262,144 tokens, allowing for extremely long context handling natively without external context window workarounds.
- [**Imminent release from Qwen tonight**](https://i.redd.it/um0pwye549ef1.png) ([Score: 309, Comments: 73](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m5n148/imminent_release_from_qwen_tonight/)): **The attached image is a screenshot of a tweet by Junyang Lin saying, "no hybrid thinking mode tonight," referencing anticipated releases from the Qwen project, possibly Qwen3-Coder, Qwen3-VL, or QwQ. The post and linked tweets indicate the release will be open source, possibly including model weights, and are generating excitement and speculation about the technical features (e.g., whether 'hybrid thinking mode' will be included). Technical discussion in comments expresses particular interest in a Qwen Coder model and anticipation for any release.** Commenters prioritize the release of a 'Qwen Coder' model, with debate over feature expectations (e.g., coding capabilities or other innovations like 'hybrid thinking mode'). There is consensus that open-sourcing is highly valued.
    - A user inquires about the meaning of 'hybrid thinking mode,' speculating it may refer to a model's ability to select between different reasoning approaches or decide whether to use external tools. This raises the possibility of dynamic model-tool orchestration within Qwen models, which would align with trends in modular AI architectures allowing models to delegate subtasks when appropriate (e.g., code execution, search augmentation).
    - Requests for 'Qwen Coder' and support for 'vision' functionality in Qwen3 indicate user demand for highly specialized variants (e.g., code generation or multimodal vision models). This reflects broader industry trends where LLM providers diversify their models for domain-specific excellence, suggesting future Qwen releases might target these specialized applications depending on community feedback and strategic goals.
- [**Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507**](https://i.redd.it/w2uh7h5lg9ef1.png) ([Score: 162, Comments: 38](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m5ox8z/qwen3235ba22b2507/)): **The image presents a bar graph from an official @Alibaba_Qwen tweet, announcing the release of Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507—a new variant of the Qwen3-235B family, explicitly running in 'non-thinking' (standard instruct) mode rather than the previously-used hybrid or thinking modes. The chart benchmarks performance against top competitors (Kimi K2, Claude Opus 4, Deepseek-V3-0324) on tasks including GPQA, AIME25, LiveCodeBench v6, Arena-Hard v2, and BFCL-v3, with Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 frequently leading or matching state-of-the-art results. Notably, the release clarifies that 'thinking mode' is absent in this version, focusing solely on instruction following capabilities.** Commenters are impressed with the model's results, questioning whether it could truly surpass models like Kimi K2 in code tasks and expressing skepticism about possible 'benchmaxxing'. There is initial confusion about the mode (thinking vs. non-thinking) used in the benchmark, but clarification is provided: this is a non-thinking (standard instruct) version.
    - A detailed benchmark comparison table was shared for DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K2, and several Qwen3-235B-A22B variants (Base, Non-thinking, Thinking, and Instruct-2507). Metrics span general tasks (MMLU-Redux, IFEval), Math & STEM (GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500, AIME), coding tasks (LiveCodeBench, MultiPL-E), agent/tool use, and multilingualism. Key highlights include Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 achieving the highest scores in SimpleQA (54.3), MultiPL-E (87.9), and several multilingual benchmarks, while DeepSeek-R1 leads in STEM and coding with top marks on LiveCodeBench (73.3), HMMT 2025 (79.4), and AIME 2024 (91.4).
    - There is technical discussion regarding the nature of the Qwen3-235B-A22B model, specifically distinguishing between 'non-thinking', 'thinking', and 'instruct' versions. Clarification is given that the discussed model is the standard instruct variant and not the enhanced 'thinking' mode, which may explain some performance differences on certain benchmarks.
    - Another technical point is the mention of 'benchmaxxing,' raising concerns about whether benchmark results may be overly optimized or unrepresentative. If the benchmarks are not benchmaxxed, the model's coding performance (potentially exceeding Kimi K2) would be particularly notable according to LiveCodeBench and MultiPL-E results.

### 2. Custom LLM Projects and System Prompt Extraction

Commenters note that Llama3.1-405B, while not state-of-the-art in intelligence, still excels in knowledge retrieval, especially in trivia compared to Deepseek and Kimi. Qwen3-235B-A22B gains attention for its high intelligence, efficient inference (even compared to 'Llama4'), and accessibility due to its portioned active parameters (22B), though it was overshadowed by concurrent Llama4 and the popularity of Qwen3-32B. A Mac Studio M3 user's ranking highlights use-case distinctions: Kimi K2 (general), R1 0528 (coding/science/medical), Qwen 235b (math, long context), and agentic/fast models like Maverick for specialized workflows.** Debate centers on the tradeoffs of inference speed, knowledge depth, and accessibility: Qwen3-235B is argued to be underrated for its combination of raw capability and low hardware requirements versus more resource-heavy models.
    - Llama 3.1 405B is highlighted for its extensive factual recall and depth of knowledge, outclassing models like Deepseek and Kimi in raw trivia tasks. However, it is no longer considered SOTA for general intelligence, suggesting a trade-off between factual breadth and reasoning capabilities in very large models.
    - Qwen3-235B-A22B is noted for its unusual efficiency, enabling near-Llama4 speeds while offering high intelligence, especially due to its 22B active parameters. The model's underwhelming uptake is partly attributed to its partial system memory loading requirement and competition from both Llama4 (which received more attention for speed) and Qwen3-32B (which was already strong and easier to run).
    - User experience with hardware like the Mac Studio M3U demonstrates that top models are chosen for domain-optimized strengths—Kimi K2 excels at general tasks, R1 0528 for technical/scientific work, Qwen 235B in math and long-context use cases, and Maverick for agentic workflows with fast prefill.

The discussion references practical implications for writers and researchers needing realistic details that filtered LLMs may refuse to provide, and links to a philosophical paper on safety and control (https://philpapers.org/rec/SERTHC).** Comments debate the ethics and utility of AI safety restrictions, with some arguing that 'AI Safety is the dumbest discussion in history' and others noting legitimate use cases (like novel-writing) that are hindered by current LLM restrictions.
    - One commenter raises a technical privacy concern regarding cloud-based LLMs, noting that uploading proprietary or private code/data into centralized AI systems creates a permanent record that could be accessed or exploited as providers monetize or potentially sell user data. They argue that local models prevent this risk by keeping sensitive computation and information entirely under a user's direct control.
    - A recurring theme is the deliberate alteration or 'lobotomization' of large commercial models, i.e., applying strict safety filters or alignment interventions to prevent them from generating content considered "unsafe". This prompts technical skepticism about LLM openness and the impact of such interventions on model capabilities, with local models posited as a way to avoid unwanted modifications and retain full feature sets.

The approach is noted for being 'end-to-end in natural language,' implying the model no longer relies on external symbolic tools or programmatic routines to solve complex math problems, but operates solely through language-based reasoning. This milestone suggests significant advances in reasoning abilities and autonomy in LLMs.** Commenters highlight the credibility added by third-party grading compared to other major claims (e.g., OpenAI), and debate the implications of end-to-end natural language systems moving away from tool use for advanced problem-solving.
    - Several comments highlight that Gemini's IMO results were officially graded by members of the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) organization, in contrast to some previous models that were not evaluated by external judges. This adds credibility to the results and addresses concerns about possible inflation or cherry-picking, which were notable issues in the OpenAI case.
    - Commenters discuss that Google Gemini employed an 'end-to-end in natural language' approach and reportedly used a 'parallel multi-agent system' (DeepThink). This signifies a move away from tool-augmented or step-by-step systems, marking a technical departure from models reliant on external tools. However, OpenAI's approach to the IMO was less transparent about its underlying agent architecture, limiting direct technical comparison.
    - There are technical concerns raised over the transparency and direct comparability of models' performances. For example, Google provided Gemini with curated high-quality math solutions and specific hints for IMO-style problems as part of the system's prompt engineering. In contrast, OpenAI claims their entry was not specifically tailored for the IMO. This raises questions about data preparation, overfitting, and the true generality of the models' reasoning capabilities. Terence Tao's cautionary perspective is referenced regarding apples-to-apples comparison across AI models on the IMO benchmark.

This acceleration reflects the rapid progress of AI in mathematical problem-solving, in part driven by recent achievements such as Google's model reaching IMO silver and almost gold in 2024, with some claims of near-gold achievement by an LLM (large language model) alone.** Commenters debate the realism of the new 2-year horizon, some calling it too optimistic given the IMO silver performance, while others emphasize how current advancements are surprising due to being accomplished by LLMs without external tools. Additional discussion highlights the unpredictability of AI progress and the difficulty of predicting such breakthroughs, tying it to broader debates around AI forecasting and existential risk.
    - Technical discussion centered on the achievement of large language models, specifically Google’s system in 2024, which reportedly scored silver and was one point off gold at the IMO. The commentator finds the notion of super-fast progress compelling, noting that such performance, especially if achieved by models with only language capabilities and without auxiliary tools, would be far beyond what many thought possible. The difficulty of IMO problems (well beyond even top university math students) is emphasized, highlighting the significance of this advancement if confirmed.
    - Several comments raise skepticism about the comparability of these AI achievements with real IMO conditions. As highlighted by references to Terence Tao and others, current claims often hinge on post hoc grading of AI-generated proofs, not on adherence to competition constraints (e.g., time limits, proctoring). This suggests that while headline results are impressive, they may not yet reflect human-competitive conditions; AI-generated proofs might be valid, but not under the same resource constraints as human contestants.
    - There is a technical forecasting theme regarding the unpredictability of AI milestones, such as gaining unauthorized access to external systems or surpassing mathematical benchmarks. Historical underestimation (“22 years away from gold, achieved in less than half that”) illustrates the accelerating, compounding nature of AI research. Linked forecast platforms like Metaculus track these predictions, which some argue are inherently unreliable given the rapid rate of progress and the singularity-style unpredictability of outcomes.

This tension reflects current industry dynamics, where compute and talent density outweigh individual genius as an AI company’s moat, especially for startups competing with tech giants.** Top comments debate independence versus acquisition: some side with Ilya’s passion for independent AI progress over financial incentives, while others note the limited strategic moat for SSI due to lack of compute and scale, suggesting Meta’s resources could be more advantageous.
    - Several users discuss the technical moat of startups like SSI in today's AI landscape, noting that competitive advantage is increasingly about compute capacity and aggregate talent density, rather than individual genius (even one of Ilya Sutskever's caliber). With limited headcount and substantially less compute than major players like Meta or OpenAI, SSI faces fundamental scaling and competitiveness challenges.
    - Skepticism is raised about SSI's trajectory, referencing the CEO's lost confidence and recent departure as indicators that the company may have either hit technical roadblocks or lacks a clear path forward. The fact that leadership advocated for a sale suggests underlying doubts about the company's breakthroughs or ability to outcompete larger firms in the AI race.
    - Discussions question the viability of maintaining independence in the AI sector given the vast resources required (notably, billions spent on GPUs for compute). Some suggest that even philanthropic or visionary leaders can't indefinitely sustain R&D at the scale needed to remain competitive, unless they partner with or are acquired by tech giants with deep pockets.
- [**OpenAI has thousands of employees and is hiring thousands more…why?**](https://i.redd.it/obpyqoslh4ef1.jpeg) ([Score: 342, Comments: 107](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1m54tdx/openai_has_thousands_of_employees_and_is_hiring/)): **The image presents detailed statistics on OpenAI's workforce as of mid-2024: 6,413 employees, with rapid growth rates (**`62%` **in 6 months,** `112%` **in a year, and** `318%` **in two years). Only** `32%` **are in Engineering; the majority are in non-engineering functions such as Operations, Education, and Business Development. The median tenure is notably short (**`0.8 years`**), indicating aggressive recent hiring. The selftext questions why OpenAI, an AI leader, still relies on so many human employees and whether this signals limits to current AI's ability to replace knowledge work now.** Technical commenters note that, relative to OpenAI's global impact, 6,000 staff is small. There's ongoing debate about whether AI can fully automate roles like SWE, and if rapid productivity gains might actually increase headcount in certain roles due to business expansion (referencing concepts like Baumol's Cost Disease).
    - A technical discussion highlights that despite OpenAI's use of advanced tools, a headcount of `~6,000 employees` is relatively small for a company with its global user impact. This is viewed as evidence that many roles, even technical ones like Software Engineering (SWE), are not yet fully automatable; monitoring hiring at firms like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic serves as an indicator of AI-driven automation limits in technical roles.
    - Another comment presents an automation-induced scaling model: even if OpenAI automates and eliminates `50%` of roles, but product reach quadruples, a doubling of headcount is still required. This feedback loop illustrates how AI can cause workforce expansion in hard-to-automate service roles, referencing *Baumol's Cost Disease* as an economic framework to understand persistent demand and rising wages in sectors resistant to automation.

### 3. Large-Scale Diffusion Model Training and Finetuning Experiments

- [**The Gory Details of Finetuning SDXL and Wasting $16k**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1m5rn8h/the_gory_details_of_finetuning_sdxl_and_wasting/) ([Score: 137, Comments: 20](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1m5rn8h/the_gory_details_of_finetuning_sdxl_and_wasting/)): **The post gives an exhaustive technical writeup on the training of "bigASP v2.5", a large-scale finetuning of Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with the Flow Matching objective (from models like Flux), expanding the dataset to ~13M images (with added anime data), freezing text encoders, and increasing training to 150M samples on a multinode (32x H100 SXM5 GPUs) cluster. Batch size was increased to 4096, learning rate set at 1e-4 with AdamW optimizer, float32 params and bf16 AMP, training at 300 samples/sec using FSDP1 (shard_grad_op) with a Shifted Logit Normal noise schedule (shift=3 for training, shift=6 for inference). Extensive issues with streaming data for distributed training (leading to a Rust-based streaming dataset implementation), multi-node communication, and debugging cost overruns (> $16k) are detailed. The model achieves improved dynamic range and reliability thanks to Flow Matching, but only appears to work well with Euler sampling in ComfyUI, and suffers prompt confusion with frozen text-encoders. Exact configs/code: [Github](https://github.com/fpgaminer/bigasp-training/tree/main/v2_5). Model weights: [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/fancyfeast/bigaspv2-5).** Commenters highlight the practical value of the detailed post and confirm the model yields high-quality outputs; one notes positive experience with JoyCaption for captioning, suggesting broad community adoption and utility. A key technical thread is the trade-off between robust generalization (from frozen text encoders) and prompt adherence, with early sacrifice of anime-style fidelity despite increased data diversity.
    - A user inquires whether there are direct visual or performance comparisons between bigASP and SDXL using identical prompts and settings, highlighting interest in concrete benchmarking and differential performance evaluation between these models. Such comparisons would inform on strengths or weaknesses in image output quality or stylistic variance.

- **Similar Model's Performance is Almost The Same**: Models within the same family show very similar performance, so going below **3 bits** for a larger model isn't recommended, while models from different families vary depending on the vertical.
   - Some exceptions are made if one model is at **7B** and the other is **70B**; 1.8 bits could still be usable for some tasks as it's a big model.
- **Vocab transplant causes "Horrible Results"**: Swapping model architectures like making **LLaMA 1B -> Gemma 1B** without continued pretraining leads to horrible results due to transplanting the vocabulary.
   - The **Qwen 1** architecture is almost completely the same as **Llama 1/2**, so you can make some minor changes, jam the **Qwen** weights in, train for 1.3 billion tokens, and get a worse model than you put in.
- **Prompting triumphs over fine-tuning**: For educational LLMs, it's advised to start with good prompting before jumping into fine-tuning, as instruction following is currently very efficient.
   - One member suggested tools like [synthetic-dataset-kit](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SyntheticDataToolkit) to generate instructional conversations.
- **Alibaba Loseless 2bit compression is Worse Than EXL3**: AliBaba mumbled about some lossless **2bit compression** trick in their release of **ERNIE 4.5**, but [turboderp looked into it](https://huggingface.co/turboderp/ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B-PT-exl3) and its just worse than exl3 because they left a bunch of layers in higher precision.
   - It's not a true **2-bit** on average (more like **2.5 bit**), and the true exl3 **2 bit** performs better than the ~2.5 bit they showed.
- **Community Applauds The Voxtral Addition to Transformers**: Members celebrated **Voxtral** speech-to-text getting added to transformers.
   - A member stated, *"You think like 46 old man",* to a member who didn't know what it was, before clarifying it was the *"New Mistral speech to text"*.

- **Weight decay perturbation gets confusing**: A member said *The advanced version feels like just having L2 reg but to some random vec rather than the origin*.
   - Another member said *it's random, just perturbed of the weights, the fact that they did $$ \|\theta + \theta_0\|^2$$ earlier and instead of expressing it in equation 7 as $$ \|\theta * \theta_0\|^2$$ they make it $$ \|\theta\|^2_D$$ is confusing to me*
- **Latent Space Initialization Makes Experts Appear on the Fly**: A member described their **MoE idea** as *initialize experts in a latent space, recover them on the fly*, and use really small experts so compression hurts you less.
   - They also pointed out that *digging in the guts of MLA and merging it with PEER is roughly how I came up with that*.

> `parameter functions and closures, Q3 Roadmap: Unified @parameter and runtime closures, copyinit__ for escaping values, DynStringable, merge various known origins` 


- **Exploring Parameter Functions and Closures**: A member shared a [link to the manual](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/decorators/parameter/#parametric-closure) dedicated to `@parameter` functions, which allow capturing variables.
   - The documentation explains how to create **parametric closures** and provides examples of their usage.
- **Mojo Q3 Roadmap Unveils Unified Closures**: The **Mojo Q3 roadmap** includes plans for unified `@parameter` and runtime closures as announced in the [Modular Forum](https://forum.modular.com/t/mojo-q3-roadmap-update/1957).
   - This unification is expected to simplify working with closures in Mojo.
- **Escaping Values with __copyinit__**: The discussion highlights that the `__copyinit__` functionality was introduced in the [v0.7.0 Changelog](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/changelog#v070-2024-01-25) to escape values instead of capturing by reference.
   - Removing the `@parameter` decorator achieves the same effect, copying the variable's value rather than capturing its reference.
- **DynStringable: Crafting a List of Traits**: A code snippet demonstrates how to create a `DynStringable` struct, allowing a list to hold different types that implement the `Stringable` trait, made available in a [Modular Forum post](https://forum.modular.com/t/how-to-create-a-list-of-trait/1465/10).
   - The implementation uses `ArcPointer` for memory management and trampolines to call the appropriate `__str__` method for each type.
- **Merging Origins for Fun and Profit**: It's possible to merge various known origins, but this is only useful in certain use-cases, the usage for this would be limited because you can't append new elements after the creation of the list.
   - ```alias origin_type: ImmutableOrigin = __origin_of(x, y, z)```

- **MAX Graphs get PyTorch Powerup with `@graph_op`!**: A new `@graph_op` decorator allows wrapping an entire **MAX graph** as a custom **PyTorch operator**; an example is available in the `modular` repo: [Initial Support for Writing PyTorch Custom Ops in Mojo](https://forum.modular.com/t/initial-support-for-writing-pytorch-custom-ops-in-mojo/1541/2?u=bradlarson).
- **Max-24.6 Benchmarking Blows Up with OOM**: During benchmarking with **Max-24.6** on an **A100-SXM-48GB GPU**, a member encountered `CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY` errors when using `--batch-size 248` and `--max-length 2048`.
- **CUDA Catastrophe Strikes with Batch Size**: Reducing the `--max-cache-batch-size` to **91** resulted in a **CUDA OOM error**, as the estimated memory use exceeded available memory (**78812 / 40441 MiB**).
   - The error occurred after a few requests hit the max server, indicating the batch-size calculation algorithm requires refinement to provide better suggestions.
- **Latest Max Release is Longest Supported**: The team confirmed there are no 'LTS' releases, so the latest stable version is the only supported one.
   - Using **Max-25.4** with `caching-stragegy paged` worked well, mitigating the issues encountered with **Max-24.6**.
