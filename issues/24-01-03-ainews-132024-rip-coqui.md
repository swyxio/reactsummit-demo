description: >-
  **Coqui**, a prominent open source text-to-speech project from the Mozilla ML
  group, officially shut down. Discussions in the **HuggingFace** Discord
  highlighted skepticism about the claimed `3X faster` speed of **sdxl**,
  attributing improvements more to techniques like `torch.compile` and removal
  of `fp16` and `attention` rather than **diffusers 0.25** features. Users
  confirmed that a *HuggingFace user token* can be used across multiple
  machines, though distinct tokens are recommended for safety. The **Learning
  Loss Minimization (LLM) Leaderboard** briefly experienced issues but was later
  confirmed operational. A Kaggle notebook was shared demonstrating how to build
  Transformer architectures from scratch using PyTorch. Additionally, a new
  image dataset with 15k shoe, sandal, and boot images was introduced for
  multiclass classification tasks. Explanations about the workings of the Common
  Crawl web-crawling process were also shared.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> Meta: More tuning since yesterday. We've tuned down the repetitive OpenAI bug reports, and also tweaked the prompts for better summarization.

Coqui, one of the leading open source text to speech options surviving from the Mozilla ML group, [shut down today](https://twitter.com/_josh_meyer_/status/1742522906041635166). The announcement tweet is beautiful and heartfelt.

- **LAION in Hot Waters Due to Unsavory Content**: `@chad_in_the_house` discussed a recent [Stanford paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXYLyDhcyWY&t=1421s) that discovered child pornography in LAION datasets, forcing LAION to take them down. The community expressed concern over this issue and discussed alternatives like using Common Crawl.
  
- **Debate Over Responsible Disclosure and Impact**: Users `@progamergov`, `@.undeleted`, and `@peacekeeper8310` evaluated the Stanford researchers' approach, with some stating that revealing the issue without allowing LAION to mitigate it first could be construed as reckless and not aligned with responsible disclosure norms in the security world. In addition, they pointed out the possibility of an anti-FOSS AI agenda and corpos looking for regulatory capture.

- **Rethinking the Strategy – More Due Diligence?**: `@thejonasbrothers` and `@chad_in_the_house` debated potential solutions to the problem, acknowledging the mutable nature of illegal images and the impossibility of a 100% uncontaminated dataset. They argued for a middle ground approach - potentially legalizing datasets if due diligence has been made to remove Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content.

- **Intricacies of Content Responsibility**: User `@thejonasbrothers` pointed out that the responsibility must ultimately lie with those hosting illicit content, not with LAION for containing potentially 'harmful strings'. Yet, the ongoing dilemma raises questions about the legality of crawling, saving, and possibly distributing potentially contaminated data.

- **Hard Questions on Purging Troublesome Data**: In light of the recent issues with LAION databases, users `@chad_in_the_house` and `@thejonasbrothers` navigate the complexities of removing all problematic content. They concede that total eradication might be impossible, but reducing it to an acceptable degree could become the next best move. However, the paper exposing the issue in LAION datasets could inadvertently provide a roadmap for locating illicit content on the internet, complicating the matter further.
