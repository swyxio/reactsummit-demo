- **Implementing Mistral for Chatbots**: `@gmist` reported that the **Mistral-medium** model sometimes answers the question from its own knowledge base rather than relying on the given context. The prompt instructs the model to answer only from the context but this issue persists, as Mistral doesn't always obey the prompt.
- **Prompt Modifications**: `@gmist` shared that some prompt modifications seem to work while some do not. The issue of inconsistent performance of prompts has led `@gmist` to revert back to GPT, which has proven to be reliable for the given use case.
- **Solutions for Mistral's Contextual Understanding**: `@sublimatorniq` suggested prefixing each line of context with "CONTEXT BODY" and introducing "hypnotic var naming" to improve contextual understanding. `@gmist` also reported that removing chat history appeared to improve Mistral's responsiveness to prompt guidelines.
- **Mistral vs Mixtral**: `@daain` experienced the same instruction-following issues with a LlamaIndex RAG app and various versions of Mistral. However, daain found that **Mixtral** performed better than Mistral, suggesting a finetune with a strongly trained system prompt as a possible solution.
- **Prompt Template Updates**: `@The Ledger Luminary` recommended updating the prompt template and rewording it to be as explicit as possible, as well as referencing specific context pieces. Luminary warned that if there is too much context (high token count), the instructions could be affected by sliding window attention.

- **Waiting before connecting to the pod**: User `@caseus_` pointed out that waiting approximately 2 minutes before connecting to the pod helps avoid issues with loading the mount point and missing axolotl install.
- **Issues with using multiple GPUs**: `@mr_morning` encountered problems with Out Of Memory (OOM) errors while trying to fine-tune Yi using multiple RTX 4090 GPUs. Despite having two GPUs, the system recognises only one (`num_machines:1`). `@visuallyadequate` responded that the `accelerate` library should distribute the load on its own without the need for optimized multi GPU training solutions like `deepspeed` or `fsdp`, but the weights will still try to load onto each GPU which could be less desirable.
- **Enabling deepspeed and fsdp for multi GPU usage**: `@visuallyadequate` suggested enabling `deepspeed` or `fsdp` for optimized multi GPU training in the relevant yaml file, and linked the [axolotl repository on Github](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) for detailed instructions. `@noobmaster29` recommended using `zero3 deepspeed` considering the ongoing issues with `fsdp`.
- **Continuing OOM issues and adjustments**: Despite various adjustments, including calibrating `max_split_size` and modifying the `batch_size`, `@mr_morning` continued to face OOM errors. In light of this, he considered switching his current RTX 4090 GPUs for a GPU with larger memory capacity (48gb).
- **Troubles with mpl4py installation**: `@mr_morning` reported encountering issues while trying to install `mpl4py` and its dependencies on an RTX 6000 Ada GPU, which led to errors such as "Cannot link MPI programs. Check your configuration!!"
