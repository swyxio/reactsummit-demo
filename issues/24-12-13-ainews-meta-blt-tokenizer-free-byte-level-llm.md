> AI News for 12/12/2024-12/13/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **31** Discords (**209** channels, and **6703** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **741 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

In a day with [monster $250m fundraising](https://www.liquid.ai/blog/we-raised-250m-to-scale-capable-and-efficient-general-purpose-ai) and [Ilya declaring the end of pretraining](https://x.com/swyx/status/1867700802791649670), we are glad for Meta to deliver a paper with some technical meat: [Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/byte-latent-transformer-patches-scale-better-than-tokens/).

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/7e0f1f91-63be-4e42-9726-fcf492926c31.png?w=960&fit=max)

The abstract is very legible. In contrast to previous byte level work like [MambaByte](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13660), BLT uses dynamically formed patches that are encoded to latent representations. As the authors say: "**Tokenization-based LLMs allocate the same amount of compute to every token**. This trades efficiency for performance, since tokens are induced with compression heuristics that are not always correlated with the complexity of predictions. **Central to our architecture is the idea that models should dynamically allocate
compute where it is needed**. For example, a large transformer is not needed to predict the ending of most
words, since these are comparably easy, low-entropy decisions compared to choosing the first word of a new
sentence. This is reflected in BLT’s architecture (§3) where there are three transformer blocks: two small
byte-level local models and a large global latent transformer."

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/62ee460d-7c2a-4024-a9ea-9df91f945523.png?w=960&fit=max)

The authors trained this on ~1T tokens worth of data and compared it with their house model, Llama 3, and it does surprisingly well on standard benchmarks:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/be425c17-fcbf-4232-94a1-8752ea4c1b19.png?w=960&fit=max)

but also does much better on tasks that usually trip up tokenizer based models (the CUTE benchmark):

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/5759c1f7-5cd9-4d1d-8468-fdf5122e2ff9.png?w=960&fit=max)


What's next - scale this up? Is this worth throwing everything we know about tokenization out the window? What about Long context/retrieval/IFEval type capabilities? 

Possibly byte-level transformers unlock NEW kinds of multimodality, as [/r/localllama explains](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1hdpw14/metas_byte_latent_transformer_blt_paper_looks/):

> example of such new possibility is "talking to your PDF", when you really do exactly that, **without RAG, and chunking by feeding data directly to the model**. You can think of all other kinds of crazy use-cases with the model that natively accepts common file types.
