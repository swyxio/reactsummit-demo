  **Alibaba** surprised with the release of **Qwen-Image**, a **20B MMDiT**
  model excelling at bilingual text rendering and graphic poster creation, with
  open weights and demos available. **Google DeepMind** launched **Gemini 2.5
  Deep Think** to Ultra subscribers, showing significant reasoning improvements
  and benchmark gains (+11.2% AIME, +13.2% HLE, +13.4% LiveCodeBench) rivaling
  **OpenAI's o3 Pro**. ByteDance's **SeedProver** achieved state-of-the-art math
  theorem proving results, surpassing DeepMind's AlphaGeometry2. OpenAI is
  developing a "universal verifier" for math and coding gains transfer.
  Competitive reasoning benchmarks and game arenas by Google and Kaggle
  highlight a meta-shift in reasoning model efficiency, comparable to the
  original Transformer leap. Other open-weight models gaining momentum include
  **GLM-4.5**, **XBai o4**, and **Tencent Hunyuan** with a focus on efficient

> `VITS checkpoint training insights, On-device VITS system on iOS, Children voices recording, Avocodo and iSTFTNet for audio fidelity, Universal vocoder for Speech LLM` 


- **VITS Training Yields Eureka Moments**: After training a **VITS checkpoint overnight**, a member shared insights: **model quality depends on the number of epochs and dataset quality**, and **VITS excels at speaker disentanglement** for creating models with distinct voices.
   - They noted **VITS encodes raw audio into latent space** for realistic recreation and emphasized that it depends on specific needs compared to RVC.
- **VITS Runs into iOS Memory Mayhem**: A member reported that using **VITS for on-device system voice on iOS** faces memory consumption challenges with the **Hifi-GAN decoder**, requiring chunk-wise decoding.
   - They also found **VITS can learn subtleties like breathing at commas** and different styles for quoted text with proper annotation.
- **To Child Voice, Schedule Recording Hours Carefully**: A member expressed uncertainty about the number of hours needed to **record children's voices** for fine-tuning light woman-voices for a better baseline.
   - Another member suggested that 24 hours per speaker is overkill, emphasizing the need for quality data over quantity.
- **Avocodo's Fidelity Facelift Forefronts**: Members discussed **Avocodo** as a means for quick fidelity boosts without significant speed increase, noting reduced artifacts limited to dataset quality, with a link to an unofficial [Avocodo-pytorch implementation](https://github.com/rishikksh20/Avocodo-pytorch).
   - They pointed out that the linked implementation uses **Hi-Fi GAN** but requires training a model yourself.
- **Universal Vocoder Quest Kickstarts**: A member expressed a need for a **universal vocoder** for plugging **VITS into a Speech LLM**, requiring fast speed, low GPU usage, and the ability to train from scratch.
   - One suggestion was [BigVGAN](https://github.com/NVIDIA/BigVGAN), though the original poster wants to train from scratch; others considered the impact of lightweight LLM architecture.

- **Circular Import Causes Grief**: One member reported an `ImportError: cannot import name 'convert_lora_modules' from partially initialized module 'unsloth_zoo.vllm_utils'` arising from a **circular import** when using `use_async=True` with `unsloth.FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained`.
- **Special Tokens Trigger Runtime Error**: A member encountered a `RuntimeError` related to **size mismatch** when loading a merged model after fine-tuning and adding **2 special tokens** to the tokenizer and model's embedder.
   - Another member suggested that adding new tokens isn't fully resolved, and the system might still attempt to load the base model's tokenizer; also, using `resize_model_vocab = 128258` may partially solve the issue, but not consistently for merged models, as it may load the base model's tokenizer.
- **UV venv causes performance decrease**: A user experienced a **20x performance slowdown** when using Unsloth within a **UV venv**, which led to extremely slow initialization during cuda graph shape capture.
   - It was suggested that UV might be downloading all xformers versions, causing the slowdown, but a member pointed out that they used mamba instead, to avoid using UV altogether.
- **Tool Calling troubles with Qwen3**: A user reported issues with **Qwen3 30B variants** not reliably performing **tool calling** in their **Langchain app**, unlike previous experiences with Qwen3 4B and larger models, despite using the latest Unsloth versions with Ollama.
   - It was suggested to check `fast_inference=True`, but the user confirmed it was already enabled, then it was suggested to check [this vLLM issue](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/12324) related to vLLM and UV.
- **vLLM struggles with GGUF model**: A user encountered a `ValueError: GGUF model with architecture qwen3moe is not supported yet` when attempting to run **Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-1M-Q8_0.gguf** on **vLLM**.
   - Members suggested that gguf format should rather be run on *llama.cpp* and noted the model architecture may not be supported, prompting a suggestion to install Transformers from source to potentially resolve the issue.

> `Kimi vs Claude, Kimi K2 Turbo pricing and speed, Using Kimi K2 Turbo in Claude code, Chinese companies video generation, Kimi K2's prompt format similar to ChatGPT` 


- **Kimi K2 challenges Claude throne**: After testing, a user finds that **Kimi K2** is the first model they feel they can use instead of **Claude**, ditching **Gemini 2.5 Pro** completely.
   - They add that coding, as a kind of information, is becoming freer and it's happening way faster than expected, eventually, most AIs will converge in terms of knowledge, and the differences between them will start to fade.
- **Kimi K2 Turbo goes 4x faster**: Kimi K2 Turbo is the **same model but with faster hosting**, now available with a special promo until Sept 1: **$0.30/1M** input tokens (cached), **$1.20/1M** input tokens (non-cached), and **$5.00/1M** output tokens.
   - This pricing implies it's *4x faster for 2x the price* during the discount, intended for users with speed requirements, and its official API helps keeps things steady.
- **Kimi K2 Turbo environment variable settings**: To use `kimi-k2-turbo-preview` in Claude code, set the following environment variable configurations: `export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL=kimi-k2-turbo-preview` and `export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=kimi-k2-turbo-preview`.
- **Kimi K2's prompt design mimics ChatGPT's**: Users noticed Kimi's prompt format is very similar to **ChatGPT**, with one user canceling subscriptions with **Gemini** ($250/month) and **OpenAI ChatGPT Pro** ($200/month) and **Grok 4 Heavy** ($3000/year).
   - One member joked that all it takes to get similar results from other chatbots is to *add a system prompt to tell it to act like an unhinged degen Discord mod, and tell it to “go and express yourself” haha.*
- **Google Gemini's daily deep think limit**: Members ridiculed Google Gemini Ultra's plan imposing **10 queries a day for $250/month**, one member calling it *very funny and very scummy*.
   - One added that even **ChatGPT pro** at $200/month gives unlimited **Office 365 Pro**, while **Claude Max** is more reasonable.

- **Hermes-3 Dataset Refusals Ruffle Quantization**: Members discussed whether refusals in the **Hermes-3 dataset** were purposeful or artifacts of censored models, with one member using it to compute the *imatrix* for quantization and finding unexpected refusals leading to [further dataset investigation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NousResearch/Hermes-3).
   - The main intention was to confirm the dataset is devoid of refusals.
- **Unitree's R1 Robot Democratizes Embodied A.I.**: The community discussed the **Unitree R1 foundational robot model**, priced at **$5,900**, which offers a fully open software development kit (**Python**, **C++**, or **ROS**) for A.I. development, as showcased in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljo7TjOqRzs).
   - It is an ideal tool for research teams transitioning to the next evolution of A.I.
- **Horizon Alpha Model sparks OpenAI Base Model Release Rumors**: Members discussed **OpenAI's Horizon Alpha model**, with speculation it resembles **OpenAI's** style and could be a **120B MoE** model with low activation, or possibly a **20B** model, as suggested in [this tweet](https://x.com/apples_jimmy/status/1951180954208444758).
   - There is speculation on Reddit, with [this thread](https://www.rxddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mepeqh/the_openai_open_weight_model_might_be_120b/) suggesting if it is **FP4** only, proper quantization would be impossible.
- **Quantization Quandaries for OpenAI's Leaked Model**: The community analyzed leaked config files indicating **OpenAI's model** is a **116.8B/5.7B MoE** model, which, when padded for GGUF, pushes it to **132.7B/6.3B**, making it difficult to quantize using methods other than **Q4_0**, **Q5_0**, **Q8_0**, and **IQ4_NL** due to the architecture's hidden size.
   - Because the hidden size of 2880 does not allow quantization to K or I quants.
- **SmolLM & Qwen2.5 Quantization Gotchas**: Discussions revealed that **SmolLM (135B/360B)** and **Qwen2.5 0.5B** have dimensions that cannot be made into K or I quants.
   - The members reported that only *o_proj* (from attention) can be quantized to K or I quants for the alleged **GPT model**.

> `RAG query expansion techniques, Sentence embeddings vs. token embeddings, Cross-encoders for semantic similarity, Knowledge Graphs for information retrieval, LLMs and question-answer co-occurrence` 


- **Query Expansion Boosts RAG Performance**: Members discussed [query expansion](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/query_expansion) for RAG systems, suggesting generating multiple questions from a single query.
   - Specifically, for *'what is the name of the customer'*, it was proposed to create the questions *'What is the name?'* and *'Who is the customer?'* to improve retrieval.
- **Cross-Encoders Fail Ranking Task**: Experiment using a cross-encoder with **MS MARCO** data to rank results for the question *'What is the name of the customer?'* showed poor results.
   - The expected top hit (*Customer Name*) was ranked lower than (*Definition of Customer*), with scores of -0.67 vs -1.67.
- **Fine-Tuning Retrieval Task is Key**: To control ranking quality, directly training on a retrieval task is essential, according to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01349).
   - It was suggested that the optimal similarity metric is task-dependent, meaning general-purpose embeddings may not suffice for specific retrieval scenarios.
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash favors Gemma Models**: Members found that Gemini-2.5-flash consistently ranked **Gemma models** higher than other models, even some 70B models.
   - It's suspected that the **response tone** of Gemma models might be more plausible to both humans and LLMs, influencing the ranking.
- **LLMs Parallel Thinking Debated**: Discussion around [Google's Gemini 2.5](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-deep-think/) and its *'Deep Think'* feature, which uses parallel thinking to deliver more detailed and thoughtful responses.
   - Some suggested the model generates multiple ideas in parallel, with parallel COT, while others believe it's higher-level orchestration of basic models and context management.

   - A member warned that using `nnsight layer.output[0]` will get you the 1st batch element only, not full residual stream, a bug spotted thanks to [nnterp tests](https://butanium.github.io/nnterp).
- **Attention Probes Produce Promising Probing Progress**: Members discussed promising attention probes, but were surprised by the mixed results, based on [attention probes work](https://link-to-attention-probes-work).
   - One member suggested probing with a suffix to consider what you're trying to probe for, asking the LM to consider what you're trying to probe for (e.g. *Is the above statement true?*).
- **NIAH Datasets' Last-Token's Talent**: Members stated that the underperformance of attention probes is mainly coming from the **NIAH datasets**, which are constructed so that the thing being classified comes right at the end of the sequence.
   - This would explain why last-token probing works well there; in that case, one should train both a linear probe and an attention probe.
- **McKenzie Probing Papers Promote Prompting Progress**: The probing paper [McKenzie et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10805v1) considers prompting the model to give an answer as a baseline (with results lower than for probes), but not prompting to improve probing.
   - It's possible this would be an improvement on the datasets we considered where mean probes outperform last-token probes, and worth investigating.
