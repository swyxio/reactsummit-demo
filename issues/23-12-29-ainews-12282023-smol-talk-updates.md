### ▷ #[project-obsidian](https://discord.com/channels/1053877538025386074/1156472202619781140/) (82 messages🔥🔥): 
        
- **Obsidian Model Run Attempt and Help Request**: User `@vic49` initially asked for help with running the Obsidian model, expressing frustration over promised scripts that hadn't been delivered. User `@teknium`, the cofounder of Nous, tried to assist by sharing links to GitHub repositories and suggested pieces of code needed to inference Obsidian, although admitting uncertainty in how to successfully do so. He explained that Obsidian doesn't work with transformers directly, and that a custom class from Llava was used instead.

- **Community Guidance and Real Expectations**: User `@gabriel_syme` reminded `@vic49` about the volunteer basis of open source projects and the possibility of real-life events delaying promised updates, to which `@vic49` expressed disappointment over the broken promise.

- **Obsidian Model Analysis**: `@vic49` analysed the Obsidian model, stating that it relies on the Transformers library in part and includes custom classes. However, they felt they couldn't build a script without more guidance or a simple example, likening it to CogVLM's approach.

- **Introduction of TinyGPT-V**: `@qnguyen3` introduced `TinyGPT-V`, a smaller model built by Tyrannosaurus that is designed for multimodal use. He also referred to MobileVLM, a mobile-oriented multimodal vision language model.

- **Vision Model Training**: A discussion about vision model training unfolded. `@teknium` asked why vision models required multiple stages of training and why images couldn't be encoded as tokens into the regular SFT stage of an LLM. `@qnguyen3` argued that vision encoders usually lower the quality of image representation, hence the need for multiple stages of training. `@coffeebean6887` added that vision encoders were smaller, pretrained models and that training normally happened in two stages, with the end goal of mapping vision embeddings to the text embedding space.

- **Effect of Increasing top_k**: `@stefangliga` indicated warnings about increasing top_k in training. Increasing top_k might activate experts on tokens they didn't encounter during training, potentially **degrading performance**.

- **Using Same Dataset for Preference-Based DPO**: `@dangfutures` asked if the same dataset is supposed to be used for Preference-Based DPO.

- **Quantization of mixtral**: `@dangfutures` inquired about the success of quantitative analysis of **Mixtral**.

- **Random Text Generation by Unaligned Base Model**: `@noobmaster29` experienced an unaligned base model generating random text irrespective of the input, using a simple phrase like 'hello' as their test case.

- **Training on Spicyboro Dataset**: `@dangfutures` disclosed training their **Mistrals** on the Spicyboro dataset, humorously implying that the model has learned potentially sensitive information from the dataset.

- **Concerns about Evaluating Loss and Fluctuating Loss**: `@mihai4256` shared his experience of encountering a fluctuating loss and a constant decrease in eval_loss throughout the training of his **LoRa model**. `_jp1_` advised increasing the batch size and reducing the learning rate to handle fluctuations, noting that it's okay as long as the **eval_loss is decreasing**. `_jp1_` also advocated for the immediate use of **wandb** for better understanding model performance.


### ▷ #[axolotl-dev](https://discord.com/channels/1104757954588196865/1104758010959634503/) (21 messages🔥): 
        
- **Tokenizing strategy and sequence length issue**: User `@_jp1_` reported an issue related to **tokenizing strategy** and **sequence length** during the training process. The users observed that sequences exceeding the defined `sequence_len` and not automatically truncated lead to CUDA out of memory errors. The issue was noticed when changing datasets in a stable environment.
- **Discussion on length filter**: From the code perspective, `@caseus_` reminded of the existing `drop_long filter` which should filter out sequences exceeding the defined length for all datasets. However, `_jp1_` mentioned that despite this, they still faced the issue and assumed that deleting sequences manually could have affected the packing, which led to the apparent disappearance of the issue.
- **Proposed changes in prompt format**: User `@caseus_` put forth the idea of adding a separate prompt format to the yaml. This could be specific to a dataset and default to formatting using that. The use of chat templates was also proposed to be more explicit in the dataset configurations.
- **Investigation of sample_packing issue**: `_jp1_` reported facing unexpected VRAM spikes during specific conditions when `sample_packing` was enabled. A discussion ensued with `@nanobitz` about potential causes, but no firm conclusions were reached. `_jp1_` confirmed the issue didn't occur with `sample_packing` disabled.
- **Exploration of potential solutions**: Among the discussed potential solutions was using `pad_to_sequence_len: true` instead of `sample_packing`. `_jp1_` confirmed that training works fine with `pad_to_sequence_len` enabled. 
- **Further investigation**: The conversation ended with `_jp1_` expressing the intention to further explore this issue and`@nanobitz` offering support on this matter.

- **OOM Errors during Training**: `@_jp1_` was dealing with an [OOM error](https://discord.com/channels/891714134014103552/912454685702639708/922369707724046336) during the training of a 7B Mistral model with an 8k sequence length on a new dataset. The errors seemed to occur at random steps and appeared linked to the training data since the model worked fine with identical configuration but a different dataset. `@caseus_` suggested trying to write out to a file the data each step from the data loader for debugging purposes. However, `_jp1_` noted that the error disappears without using sample packing.
- **Discussion on Full Weight Finetuning**: `@athenawisdoms` inquired about the VRAM requirements for a full weight fine-tuning of Mistral 7B and whether full weight fine-tuning is the same as continued pretraining. `@noobmaster29` clarified that full tuning is pretraining and all the Axolotl full tune configurations are in bf16. The discussion also highlighted the large VRAM needs (160GB) for pretraining a 7B model, implying the need for high-end GPUs like the A100. 
- **Pretraining and Applying LoRa Adapters**: `@athenawisdoms` also asked whether one can apply the original `Llama-2-13B-Chat-fp16` LoRa adapter to a pretrained `Llama-2-7B-fp16` model and still achieve the same instruction tuning.
- **Flash Attention Query**: `@xzuyn` asked whether both the forward and backward passes need to utilize flash attention for it to work properly. `@caseus_` confirmed that it has to be used for both since the backward pass relies on the computation graph from the forward pass.
- **Mixtral vs Mistral Performance**: `@semantic_zone` reported that changing the base model from `Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1` to `mistral-7b-v0.1` significantly improved train and eval loss on their large classification dataset. They requested speculation on why this might be the case.
