It is tempting to pit Google against Anthropic, but the protocols were designed to work together to address perceived gaps in MCP:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/3c759936-9d88-40fc-9bcd-04d10ffd9e5f.png?w=960&fit=max)

The spec includes:

- the [Agent Card](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/documentation?id=overview)
- the concept of a [Task](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/documentation?id=task) - a communication channel between the home agent and the remote agent for passing [Messages](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/documentation?id=message), with an end result [Artifact](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/documentation?id=artifact).
- [Enterprise Auth and Observability](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/topics/enterprise_ready) recommendations
- [Streaming and Push Notification support](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/topics/push_notifications) (again with [push security](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/topics/push_notifications?id=agent-security) in mind)

Launch artifacts include:

- [The draft specification](https://github.com/google/A2A)
- [The documentation website](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/)
- [The Agent Development Kit](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/agent-development-kit-easy-to-build-multi-agent-applications/) which looks... oddly familiar

> `Llama 4 Fine-tuning, Deep Herme's Dataset, Selling 3090 turbo card, DeepCogito's LLMs, Iterated Distillation and Amplification` 


- **Llama 4 fine-tuning disaster is averted**: Members mentioned that fine-tuning the new **Hermes** on **Llama 4** models would be a disaster, but luckily, they perform many different tests, so if something is resulting in worse performance, it is *yeeted*.
   - It was agreed that there's still some value to **Llama 4** for some things, and it can't be worse at literally everything.
- **Deep Hermes dataset is the new creative writing dataset?**: The new **Deep Hermes** models have quite a big vocabulary, though they are not too smart at **8b**, but if this deep hermes dataset is going to be the new dataset for smarter models, then they're going to be nasty for creative writing.
   - The user tested the new **Deep Hermes** models and for how small they are, they have quite a big vocabulary (unfortunately they're not too smart at 8b).
- **Cogito LLMs using Iterated Distillation and Amplification strategy released**: [DeepCogito](https://www.deepcogito.com/research/cogito-v1-preview) released the strongest LLMs of sizes **3B**, **8B**, **14B**, **32B** and **70B** under open license.
   - Each model outperforms the best available open models of the same size, including counterparts from **LLaMA**, **DeepSeek**, and **Qwen**, across most standard benchmarks; the **70B** model also outperforms the newly released **Llama 4 109B MoE** model.
- **Models mirror human debate tactics**: A member put two models to face each other in argument and realized how similar it's to when human debate, *they actually never trying to understand the other view and keep on standing on their view what ever the argument is*.
   - The models choose the weakness that they could attack back, ignored the part that could put them in a questionable position and focused on the part that they could use to put the other model into questionable position.
- **Qwen 2.5 1.5B Instruct training shows promise**: A member is doing **RL** on **Qwen 2.5 1.5B Instruct** and swapped out the **gsm8k** dataset for **gsm8k platinum**, enabling **RsLora** and the model seems to be learning much quicker in fewer steps.
   - The improvement may be from using the less ambiguous dataset, and how much is from using **RsLora**.

> `Local Embedding Models, GPT4All Document Indexing, Local LLM Loading Issues, RAG Implementation, GPT4All Stop Button` 


- **Run Embedding Models Locally for Safety**: Members discussed the benefits of running embedding models and LLMs locally to avoid sending private information to remote services, with one member providing [a shell script](https://gnu.support/files/tmp/clipboard-2025-04-09-01-48-48.html) for running a local embedding model from Nomic.
   - The script uses variables such as `$LLAMA_SERVER`, `$NGL_FLAG`, `$HOST`, `$EMBEDDING_PORT`, and `$EMBEDDING_MODEL` to configure and run the embedding server.
- **GPT4All Indexes Documents by Chunking and Embedding**: A user explained that **GPT4All** indexes documents by chunking and embedding them, storing representations of similarities in a private cache.
   - The user recommended running a local embeddings model and LLM model, suggesting that even **Qwen 0.5B** parameters can work well with documents, though **Qwen 1.5B** is better.
- **User Struggles Loading Local LLM**: A member reported getting stuck while loading a local LLM, despite having **16GB RAM** and an **Intel i7-1255U CPU**.
   - They suspected the issue was with downloading the model, and mentioned their use case as an internal documentation tool, expressing caution about using remote services for private documents.
- **DIY RAG with Shell Scripting**: A member shared shell script examples for getting embeddings and sending prompts to a local LLM.
   - They suggested using **PostgreSQL** for storing embeddings and creating a custom RAG implementation, rather than relying on remote tools. Shell script examples `rcd-llm.sh` and `rcd-llm-get-embeddings.sh`.
- **GPT4All's Hidden Stop Button**: A user asked how to stop text generation in **GPT4All**, noting the absence of a visible stop button or the ability to use **Ctrl+C**.
   - Another user pointed out the stop button at the bottom right, which is the same button as the Generate button.

> `Span Lifetimes in Mojo, Fearless Concurrency in Mojo, MLIR Type Construction with Compile-Time Parameters, Parametric Operations Dialect (POP)` 


- **Span Lifetime Woes with Mojo Traits**: A member sought advice on how to express in Mojo that *the lifetime of a returned Span is at least the lifetime of self*, providing [Rust/Mojo code examples](https://forum.modular.com/t/how-to-return-a-span-that-refers-to-a-struct-member-from-a-trait-method/1216).
   - The response indicated that *making the trait generic over origin* is a possible solution, though trait parameter support might be needed.
- **Mojo's Fearless Concurrency on the Horizon**: A question arose on whether *Mojo has Rust-like fearless concurrency*.
   - The answer was that Mojo has the borrow checker constraints needed, and is only lacking **Send/Sync** and a final concurrency model; it may even have a better system than Rust's eventually.
- **Compile-Time MLIR Type Construction Conundrums**: A member reported an issue using *parameterized compile-time values in MLIR type construction* (specifically **!llvm.array** and **!llvm.ptr**) within the MAX/Mojo standard library, detailing the issue in [a GitHub post](https://github.com/modular/max/issues/4315).
   - The problem involves a parsing error when defining a struct with compile-time parameters used in the **llvm.array** type; MLIR's type system appears unable to process parameterized values in this context.
- **Parametric Operations Dialect (POP) to the Rescue?**: Regarding the MLIR issue, another member suggested using *the Parametric Operations Dialect (POP)*.
   - They suggested the Mojo team add features such as the **__mlir_type[...]** macro accepting symbolic compile-time values, or a helper like **__mlir_fold(size)** to force parameter evaluation as a literal IR attribute.
