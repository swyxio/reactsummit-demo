> `GPU Occupancy, MI210 Performance Analysis, RX 7900XTX Computations, CDNA Architecture Insights, Kernel Launch Dynamics` 


- **Analyzing GPU Occupancy Values**: Discussion emerged around the max occupancy values for the **MI210**, which creates confusion due to non-round numbers in comparisons to expected values from documentation, including an article from 2017.
   - *Occupancy and Resource Usage Optimization with Large Thread Groups* highlights complexities in computing these performance metrics.
- **Occupancy Values for MI210 and RX 7900XTX**: **rocminfo** attributes for MI210 showcase potential calculations indicating 2 max blocks per CU and expected occupancy metrics leading to interpretations around active warps.
   - For **RX 7900XTX**, similar calculations point towards an expected occupancy of **16**, aligning with architecture expectations.
- **Kernel Launch and Occupancy Constraints**: Insights into **CDNA1** show that while theoretical occupancy is **10**, practical usage limits this to about **8** per kernel launch due to GPU binned configurations.
   - These results suggest higher occupancy can only be achieved through launching multiple kernels simultaneously, with updated tests confirming correct block performance.
- **Dynamics of Block Launching**: The discussion notes the peculiar behavior of the **MI210**, allowing for more blocks per CU due to early exits of threads from prior blocks before the block completion.
   - This observation leads to potential kernels optimization conversations where adding `__syncthreads()` influences the block limit directly.



**Link mentioned**: <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/optimizing-gpu-occupancy-resource-usage-large-thread-groups/">Optimizing GPU occupancy and resource usage with large thread groups</a>: Sebastian Aaltonen, co-founder of Second Order Ltd, talks about how to optimize GPU occupancy and resource usage of compute shaders that use large thread groups.
