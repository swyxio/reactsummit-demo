  **Mixtral's weights** were released without code, prompting the **Disco
  Research community** and **Fireworks AI** to implement it rapidly. Despite
  efforts, no significant benchmark improvements were reported, limiting its
  usefulness for local LLM usage but marking progress for the **small models
  community**. Discussions in the DiscoResearch Discord covered **Mixtral's
  performance** compared to models like **Hermes 2.5** and **Hermes 2**, with
  evaluations on benchmarks such as **winogrande**, **truthfulqa_mc2**, and
  **arc_challenge**. Technical topics included GPU requirements, multi-GPU
  setups, and quantization via **GPTQ**. Benchmarking strategies like
  grammar-based evaluation, chain of thought (CoT), and min_p sampling were
  explored, alongside model sampling techniques like Min P and Top P to enhance
  response stability and creativity. Users also discussed GPTs' learning
  limitations and the adaptability of models under varying conditions,
  emphasizing min_p sampling's role in enabling higher temperature settings for
  creativity.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->Mixtral's weights were released without code, so overnight the Disco Research community (newly added) blew up to implement it:

- **Show-and-tell Technique for Dialogue Creation**: `@tryharder0569` discussed an approach for creating engaging dialogues using the "show-and-tell" technique, where one suggests details without stating them outright. The method focuses on figurative, metaphorical, and expressive language to demonstrate the effect of a message implicitly ([source](https://discord.com/channels/974519864045756446/1079083340637941760))
  
- **EmotionPrompt Technique for Improved Outputs**: `@madame_architect` mentioned the potentially beneficial effects of adding emotional stakes or implications to commands given to the AI. It's suggested that especially within the scope of emotive responses, the AI tends to perform better in producing targeted results (source: "Large Language Models Understand and Can Be Enhanced by Emotional Stimuli" paper).

- **Strunk and White's "Elements of Style" for AI Writing**: `@laughteronwater` advised to guide the AI's writing style according to Strunk and White's "Elements of Style", using a tone akin to National Geographic, Scientific American, or Popular Science magazines. The user warned against using clichés or colloquialisms.

- **The Effect of Emojis on Tokens**: `@pythoncodrr` cautioned that adding emojis to the AI output could consume more tokens than anticipated, as one emoji can correspond to 2-8 tokens.

- **Behavior-guiding Prompts for RPG-style Dialogue**: `@eskcanta` discussed the efficacy of using character-specific prompts to orient AI behavior. By instructing the AI to "speak as a noir detective with a dark secret", brooding and cryptic dialogues are produced. The user exhorted the importance of giving clear directives, accurate detailing of character traits, and explicit requisites in making a prompt.


### ▷ #[api-discussions](https://discord.com/channels/974519864045756446/1046317269069864970/) (40 messages🔥):

- **Behavioral Guidance**: In response to `@Ted`'s question on achieving unique texts, `@mysticmarks1` emphasized the importance of giving the AI good behavioral guidance to avoid repetition of phrases. The discussion highlighted using specific character traits, like that of a villain, to limit and diversify the AI's vocabulary.

- **Technical Issues**: `@laughteronwater` reported experiencing issues with the ChatGPT system when using certain symbols for creating tables and rhythm notation. They also discussed wanting to limit cliches and colloquialisms in the model's output and mentioned their customized instructions to get a more professional and academic writing style, similar to that of National Geographic or Scientific American magazines.

- **Realistic Job Interview Simulation**: `@eudk` and `@tryharder0569` discussed how to prompt the AI to simulate a realistic job interview. `@tryharder0569` suggested specifying certain behavioral traits in the instructions, such as being a "tough job interviewer". 

- **Custom Instructions**: `@laughteronwater` and `@tryharder0569` discussed strategies to avoid cliches in the AI's responses. They tried different instructions to ameliorate the AI's directness, with `@tryharder0569` suggesting the use of "show-not-tell" language.

- **Naming AI Characters**: `@eskcanta`,`@madame_architect`, and `@tryharder0569` discussed the beneficial effects of attributing specific roles, personalities, and motivations to AI models to guide their language and response style more effectively.

- **Emotional Prompting**: `@madame_architect` registered the merits of emotional manipulation in prompts, supported by an academic paper titled "Large Language Models Understand and Can Be Enhanced by Emotional Stimuli". 

- **Views on AI**: `@eskcanta` advocated for the need for clear understanding by users about what they want from the AI, and accurately communicating it for effective results. The discussion emphasized the need for clear communication when prompting the AI, to avoid the risks of 'magical thinking' or undue emotional manipulation.

**Azure vs GPT-4 Performance**:

- `@nosa_.` mentioned that **Azure seems better overall**, but cautioned that this may not always be the case.
- `@res6969` shared that **a switching system between GPT-4 and Azure** is used to maximize rate limits and minimize latency.
- `@wenquai` claimed that Azure is almost always 40-60% faster for them, however, they also noted that this can depend on location and Azure instance setup.

**Optimum-NVIDIA on Hugging Face For Fast LLM Inference**:

- `@laikhtewari` shared a link to a [blog post](https://hf.co/blog/optimum-nvidia) from Hugging Face explaining how Optimum-NVIDIA enables fast LLM inference (1,200 tok/s, said to be 28x faster) with just one line of code change. They also requested feedback on the blog post.

- **Model Attention on Varying Sequence Lengths**: User `@sandkoan` discussed how the effectiveness of a model can depend a lot on its **capability to pay attention at varying sequence lengths**.
- **Context Placement in the Input Sequence**: `@sandkoan` explained that the model **Claude** is likely to **forget the query if it's given before the context**, hence the context is usually placed before the query.
- **Differential Model Capabilities**: `@sandkoan` cautioned that the rules that apply to **Claude at 100k** might not necessarily apply to **Mistral at 8k**.
