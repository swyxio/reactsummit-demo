We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**428** channels, and **6173** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **696 minutes**.

As an AI-native IDE, Cursor edits a *lot* of code, and needs to do it fast, particularly [Full-File Edits](https://cursor.sh/blog/instant-apply). They have just announced a result that 

> "**surpasses GPT-4 and GPT-4o performance** and pushes the pareto frontier on the accuracy / latency curve. **We achieve speeds of >1000 tokens/s** (just under 4000 char/s) on our 70b model using a speculative-decoding variant tailored for code-edits, called **speculative edits**."

Because the focus is solely on the "fast apply" task, the team used a synthetic data pipeline tuned to do just that:

They are a little cagey about the speculative edit alogirthm - this is all they say:

> "With code edits, we have a strong prior on the draft tokens at any point in time, so we can speculate on future tokens using a deterministic algorithm rather than a draft model."

If you can figure out how to do it on gpt-4-turbo, there is a [free month of Cursor Pro](https://x.com/amanrsanger/status/1790947751393706380) for you.

- **Custom Op Issue with torch.compile**: A member reported an issue where a custom op works fine in eager mode but triggers an assert when used with torch.compile due to non-contiguous tensors. Another user suggested trying redundant `.contiguous()` calls, but the problem seemed related to tensor strides generated by Triton.

- **Memory Issues with Static Cache**: Members discussed the memory implications of using static cache, which can block larger batch sizes. A proposed solution was to use custom kernels for dynamic tensor allocations and apply torch.compile only on the results.

- **Adding torch.compile Inside no_grad**: A suggestion was made to compile the model inside a `torch.no_grad` context to localize the offending code better. However, this still resulted in non-contiguous tensors for the user.

- **Defining Custom Ops with Tags**: A user recommended defining custom ops with specific tags to fix stride issues, referencing the newish API of `torch.library`. The conversation highlighted challenges and workarounds in implementing these tags in C++ custom op definitions.

- **Reducing torch.compile Times**: A new plan to reduce warm compile times with `torch.compile` was shared, directing users to a discussion on the PyTorch forum for detailed strategies. This plan aims to bring compile times down to zero by optimizing various aspects of the compilation process.

- **Nuke the bug from orbit**: Members discussed solving complex dependencies across function boundaries by wiping everything from scratch. One humorously noted, *"I already tried to 'nuke streams from orbit' last night, but for some reason it didn't fix the code."*
- **Tracking CUDA streams**: There was considerable discussion on making CUDA streams an argument to each kernel launcher to better track execution. The broader consensus leaned towards resetting the code base regarding streams and redoing relevant PRs from scratch.
- **Remove parallel CUDA streams**: A [Pull Request #417](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/417) aimed to remove parallel CUDA streams while retaining the main stream and loss event, illustrating this with detailed comments for instructional purposes.
- **Gradient accumulation improvements**: Another [Pull Request #412](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/412) confirmed working improvements in gradient accumulation, boosting performance by 6% from 43K tok/s to 45.37K tok/s.

- **Bitnet 1.58 shows promise and needs a leader**: A member expressed enthusiasm for leading the project setup for **bitnet 1.58**, noting significant improvements compared to unquantized networks. They suggested organizing the project on a platform like GitHub and shared a [link to a reproducing project](https://huggingface.co/1bitLLM/bitnet_b1_58-3B).

- **Bitnet's quantization needs infrastructure**: The bitnet 1.58 method mentioned focuses on training-aware quantization for linear layers and has a [simple demo for training](https://gist.github.com/CoffeeVampir3/c490286467fd5e1cc070d0a7a8cf3d6f). However, it currently lacks 2-bit kernels or representations and needs groundwork for practical inference savings.

- **Challenges in practical implementation**: Discussion around how bitnet training still relies on full weight matrices with potential for post-training quantization, where a custom quantization method might be necessary. The idea of "rolling-training quantization" was suggested as a possible, albeit ambitious, path forward.

- **Proposal to centralize bitnet work in Torch AO**: A suggestion was made to centralize implementation efforts of bitnet in the [Torch AO repository](https://github.com/pytorch/ao) to leverage relevant infrastructure like custom CUDA/Triton op support and tensor subclasses.

- **Existing solutions for quantization**: It was highlighted that [HQQ](https://github.com/mobiusml/hqq) offers 2-bit bitpacking methods and that [BitBLAS](https://github.com/microsoft/BitBLAS) provides a 2-bit GPU kernel for inference. These resources can address some challenges in bitnet's quantization process.

**Datasette - LLM (@SimonW) ▷ #[ai](https://discord.com/channels/823971286308356157/1097032579812687943/1240332490154053725)** (64 messages🔥🔥): 

- **Google I/O fails to acknowledge LLM reliability issues**: Members expressed frustration that during the Google I/O keynotes, there was no mention of the unreliable nature of LLMs. "The thing that weirded me out about the I/O keynotes is that they didn't seem to acknowledge the unreliable nature of LLMs /at all/ - not even a nod towards that."
- **Sober AI showcase proposed**: Discussed the idea of creating a "Sober AI" showcase focusing on practical, mundane AI applications that work without overhyping capabilities. "Something like this: ... I'm considering introducing it as 'this is not a big talk about artificial intelligence, its a small talk about large language models and what we can do with them right now.'"
- **Gloo's role in MuckRock's AI integration**: Gloo, a third-party wrapper on Open AI's models, helps MuckRock to classify FOIA responses and perform other tasks. "If you want more details on what we're doing, he's mitch@muckrock.com."
- **Introducing "Transformative AI"**: Members discussed framing AI as "transformative" rather than "generative" to better highlight its utility in transforming and working with data. "I'm also going to pitch 'transformative AI' as a more useful framing than 'generative AI', because using LLMs to work with and transform input is a whole lot more interesting."
- **Technical insights on prompt caching**: A member noted that using Gemini's prompt caching can reduce token usage costs by keeping prompts in GPU memory. "You have to pay to keep the cache warm - $4.50/million-tokens/hour - so that means your prompt is actively loaded into the memory of a GPU somewhere, saving it from having to load in and process it every time."
