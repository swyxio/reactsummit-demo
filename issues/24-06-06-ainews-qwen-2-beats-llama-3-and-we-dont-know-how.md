### **LLM Finetuning (Hamel + Dan) ▷ #[workshop-1](https://discord.com/channels/1238365980128706560/1239614536298795121/1248071883371577434)** (2 messages): 

- **Regulatory and Research Aid through LLMs**: The LLM can serve as a **Research Assistant** by answering technical and regulatory questions using sources like scientific papers and regulatory documents. For pre-existing repositories like Arxiv, employing RAG and prompt engineering is recommended, while paywalled sources would need finetuning.
  
- **Discovery Helper for Research**: A secondary use case is a **Research Assistant** that points to promising papers by analyzing abstracts, titles, and metadata, which is valuable even if full access is restricted. Tools such as SciHub and DTIC can support this initiative by focusing on potential papers for the user.

- **LLMs for Legal Document Analysis**: The aforementioned research assistant LLMs can be adapted to handle legal documents for efficient research and discovery. The poster showed interest in seeing this implemented.

- **Document Distiller for Large Organizations**: This LLM is tailored for organizations with extensive document corpora (e.g., financial, government) to assist in regulatory compliance by summarizing and returning relevant documents based on inferred user intent. This idea is backed by mentions at the DataScience Salon conference by the NY Federal Reserve AI Chairman.

- **Fine-tuning with Modal can be complex but is worth exploring**: Charles mentioned the complexity of the fine-tuning stack with Modal but suggested users check out their simpler [Dreambooth example](https://modal.com/docs/examples/dreambooth_app). This example demonstrates the core Modal concepts through finetuning the Stable Diffusion XL model using textual inversion.
- **Adapt existing datasets for fine-tuning on Modal**: Users can point to a Hugging Face dataset directly, as suggested by Charles. Adjustments should be made to avoid using Volumes for storing this data. 
- **Use batch processing for validation**: Charles advised writing a custom `batch_generate` method and using `.map` for processing and generating validation examples. He referenced the "embedding Wikipedia" example for further guidance.
- **Exploring Modal for cost-efficiency in app hosting**: Alan was advised by Charles on potentially moving the retrieval part of his Streamlit app to Modal or considering moving the entire app there. Concerns about cold starts and cost with a 24/7 deployment were discussed.
- **Quick support for script errors**: Chaos highlighted an issue with the `vllm_inference.py` script on GitHub, and Charles quickly responded, hinting at potential problems during the build step or GPU availability. Charles emphasized Modal’s culture of speed in support and communication.

- **Small datasets cause validation issues**: Users discussed how a non-representative validation set often indicates a need for more diverse training data. One user suggested that even with fewer than 4,000 samples, models like EfficientNet V2 could perform well if other classes are included to prevent false positives.

- **Need for more details on project**: Community members asked for more specifics about a dataset issue, including the number of classes and types of false positives, to provide better help. A user offered to provide personal assistance via DM.

- **Transformers vs traditional models debate**: A user noted that while transformers in computer vision can handle data quality issues better, they significantly increase training times compared to models like YOLO and EfficientNet V2. Another member agreed, adding that transformer efficiency also depends on the size of the data.

- **Combining audio and video frames for streaming**: A user inquired about the feasibility of syncing audio frames with generated video frames at 24 FPS for streaming via WebRTC or RTMP. They sought advice or resources to achieve this without losing FPS.

- **Swin Transformer for CIFAR discussion**: One user asked if anyone had implemented the Swin Transformer (tiny) for the CIFAR dataset, though no further discussion followed on this topic.

- **Column-Major Madness**: The member finally understood the intricacies of **cublas** and its column-major order, explaining why they had to transpose matrices to compute `Q @ K^T` correctly with **cublas**. They also mentioned removing their "attention bug" PR after this realization.

- **Consolidated Memory Allocations Proposal**: Discussions focused on the benefits of consolidating all memory allocations into a single function for efficiency and easier tracking. This approach would remove the current duplication and streamline checkpointing, as noted by Erik's draft PR and linked [PR for master weights](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/522/files#diff-bf6b442957e5458cf8baab2a18039fdde86d74199a0864a79e7288fe55f31a98R2982-R2995).

- **Checkpointing with GPU CI**: There's a consensus on improving the GPU Continuous Integration (CI) with enhanced verification tests, including training checkpointing and output comparison. Erik emphasized that while initial tests are sufficient, future extensions are necessary for robust validation.

- **Cublas vs Cutlass and C++ Requirements**: Clarification was provided that **cublas**, with its C interface, does not require **C++17**, but **cutlass** does. Current code requirements for **C++17** are limited to **cudnn**–a significant detail for future development considerations.

- **Parallel Programming Course Recommendation**: The [Programing Parallel Computers course](https://ppc.cs.aalto.fi/) and its [exercises](https://ppc-exercises.cs.aalto.fi/course/open2024a) were recommended, with a note about a potential summer session that sets up a new leaderboard.

- **Dealing with high-cardinality categorical columns**: A member sought advice on handling categorical columns with numerous slightly related features and spelling mistakes, particularly for a regression task. Another member suggested aggregate/grouping and manual feature engineering or implementing spell correction techniques like string matching, and edit distance.

- **Feature Engineering vs. Clustering**: Following advice on manual grouping and spell correction, the discussion pivoted to whether clustering the features based on edit distance and their relation to the target variable would be more efficient. The consensus was to combine spell correction with other types of grouping, treating this challenge as a data modeling problem. 

- **Data Modeling and Simplification Techniques**: The conversation also touched on simplifying the model by isolating problems into components like brand and item instead of using entire titles. An additional suggestion for price prediction was to employ moving averages or exponential moving averages to simplify the process.

- **Handling context length exceedance in `llm` embeddings**: A member asks what happens if the input text exceeds the model's context length when creating embeddings using `llm`. They tested this with the entire King James Bible text file and received some results without an error, querying if those embeddings represent the whole file or if it's truncated.
- **Model behavior documentation lacking clarity**: Simon Willison responded that the behavior varies by model, with some truncating the input and others returning an error. He expressed the need for better documentation on this subject.
- **Assumption on truncated input**: Simon suggested that if no error is returned, it's likely that the input is being truncated. The specifics depend on the model's implementation.
- **Query on resuming embedding jobs**: Another member asked if rerunning a large embedding job with `embed-multi` would skip already completed parts. The question points to the need for handling partial job completions, possibly through SQL queries.
