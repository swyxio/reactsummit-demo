# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama Recap

### Theme 1. Fixing Token Issues in Bartowski Models

- **[PSA: Gemma 3 QAT gguf models have some wrongly configured tokens](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jvi860/psa_gemma_3_qat_gguf_models_have_some_wrongly/)** ([Score: 114, Comments: 44](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jvi860/psa_gemma_3_qat_gguf_models_have_some_wrongly/)): **The **Gemma 3 QAT gguf models** have wrongly configured tokens causing errors in **llama.cpp** when loading models like **12B IT q4\_0 QAT**. The error message encountered is *"load: control-looking token: 106 '' was not control-type; this is probably a bug in the model. its type will be overridden"*. Tokens **105** and **106** (**<start_of_turn>** and **<end_of_turn>**) were set as normal instead of control. By correcting these token configurations using the Hugging Face **gguf editor**, and fixing the image start and end tokens, the issue can be resolved, enhancing the model's image capabilities. The fixed model is available [here](https://huggingface.co/Dampfinchen/google-gemma-3-12b-it-qat-q4_0-gguf-small-fix) and is based on [stduhpf](https://huggingface.co/stduhpf)'s version, which offers improved speed without compromising performance.** The user notes that anomalies observed with QAT models compared to older Bartowski models were likely due to the misconfigured tokens. They noticed an immediate boost in image capabilities after making the corrections and added back the missing name metadata, which is necessary for some inference backends.

  - A representative from the Gemma team acknowledged the issue, stating *"We'll get this fixed in the released GGUFs. Thanks for the report!"*
  - Users inquired whether the issue affects models besides the 12B and requested steps to fix models like the 27B themselves.
  - Another user shared that they combined the QAT weights for Ollama but noticed the token embedding tensor is not quantized, resulting in slightly slower performance.


### Theme 2. Qwen3 Release Delayed: Community Reacts to Update

- **[Qwen Dev: Qwen3 not gonna release "in hours", still need more time](https://i.redd.it/3kcfx9xnmyte1.png)** ([Score: 605, Comments: 91](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jvs66w/qwen_dev_qwen3_not_gonna_release_in_hours_still/)): **The Qwen development team has announced that **Qwen3** will not be released *"in hours"* and needs more time before its completion. This update comes from a Twitter exchange between Junyang Lin and Bindu Reddy, where Junyang clarifies the release timeline in response to Bindu's optimistic announcement about the upcoming **Qwen3**.** Community members express embarrassment and frustration over the premature announcement, with some criticizing Bindu Reddy for previous overstatements. Others suggest that it's better to wait for a well-prepared release than to rush and potentially ship a subpar product.

- **Producer-Consumer Model Deployed for Hopper GEMMs**: A member inquired about using **producers and consumers** in GPU kernels, particularly why this model works well for **GEMMs** on **Hopper** architecture, instead of everyone producing and consuming.
- **Tensor Database Project Seeks Guidance**: A member is developing a **tensor-based GPU accelerated database system** and seeks guidance, providing a link to their [repo](https://github.com/PyDevC/kero).
- **Coalesced Vector Loads Boost Element-Wise Kernels**: Regarding element-wise operation kernels, it was suggested to try **coarsening/vectorized loads** to get higher ILP and fewer instructions, assuming global memory access is already coalesced.
- **Ampere GPU Parallelism Questioned**: A member benchmarked a kernel on an **Ampere** datacenter GPU, observing that the runtime only doubled when the number of threads was twice what they expected, questioning why the runtime doesn't change until exceeding `#SMs * #WS per SM * 32`.
   - A senior member suggested checking the **assembly view in NCU** to identify warp stalls, mentioning that a loop-carried dependency in the example code introduces stalls, as each `fadd` in one thread/warp has to wait for the previous one to finish before it can start.
- **Profiling FADD Performance on Ampere with NCU**: A member used **Nsight Compute (NCU)** to profile a kernel with `FADD` instructions on an Ampere A100 GPU, questioning why they saw `FMA` instructions in the assembly.
   - It was clarified that the **FMA pipeline** also handles **FADD/FMUL/FMAD** instructions, and that with a fully utilized pipeline, additional warps won't increase throughput due to the artificial example.
