Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **316 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Big news from [Mira Murati](https://x.com/miramurati/status/1839025700009030027?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug) and [FB Reality Labs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41650047) today, but the actual technical news you can use today is Llama 3.2:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/057082e6-48ab-452c-9b88-c98e14477edb.png?w=960&fit=max)

As teased by Zuck and previewed in the Llama 3 paper ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-llama-31-the-synthetic-data-model/)), the Multimodal versions of Llama 3.2 released as anticipated, adding a 3B and a 20B vision adapter on a frozen Llama 3.1:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/7eb80330-6b79-4854-864c-b9fe52dec70c.png?w=960&fit=max)

The 11B is comparable/slightly better than Claude Haiku, and the 90B is comparable/slightly better than GPT-4o-mini, though you will have to dig a lot harder to find out [how far it trails behind 4o, 3.5 Sonnet, 1.5 Pro, and Qwen2-VL](https://mmmu-benchmark.github.io/#leaderboard) with a 60.3 on MMMU.

Meta is being praised for their open source here, but don't miss [the multimodal Molmo 72B and 7B models from AI2](https://x.com/allen_ai/status/1838956313902219595) also releasing today. It has not escaped [/r/localLlama's attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fpb4m3/molmo_models_outperform_llama_32_in_most_vision/) that Molmo is outperforming 3.2 in vision:

- **Chain-of-thought responses boost performance**: Recent research reveals that **chain-of-thought responses** from language models significantly enhance performance across most benchmarks, as outlined in the paper [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15758).
   - However, the study questions whether performance gains stem from **human-like task decomposition** or merely the increased computation from additional tokens.
- **Filler tokens can replace thought chains**: The experiment showed that transformers could utilize **meaningless filler tokens** (e.g., '......') to tackle complex algorithmic tasks that they otherwise couldn't solve without intermediate tokens.
   - Yet, the research emphasizes that teaching models to use these filler tokens demands *specific, dense supervision* to achieve effective learning.
- **Filler tokens and quantifier depth**: The Paper provides a theoretical framework identifying a class of problems where **filler tokens** are advantageous, linking their efficacy to the **quantifier depth of first-order formulas**.
   - Within this framework, it is shown that for certain problems, chain-of-thought tokens need not convey information about intermediate computations.
- **Hidden thinking embedding remains debatable**: A query was raised about the existence of a 'hidden thinking embedding' behind the token text, indicating uncertainty around its establishment.
   - This highlights an ongoing discussion in the community regarding the mechanisms underlying model responses and the validity of *task decomposition*.

- **Steps to Fix Illegal CUDA Memory Access**: To fix an **illegal CUDA memory access** error, users should check **CUDA version compatibility** with libraries like PyTorch using `nvcc --version`.
   - Updating **NVIDIA drivers** and the CUDA toolkit can often resolve these types of compatibility issues.
- **Use Environment Variables for Debugging**: Setting `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` allows CUDA operations to run synchronously, aiding in identifying the exact line causing errors.
   - Users can run their scripts with this environment variable for clearer error detection.
- **Monitor GPU Memory Usage**: Tools like `nvidia-smi` can help track **GPU memory usage** to avoid illegal accesses due to overstepping available memory limits.
   - Adjusting batch sizes and model sizes based on observed memory can prevent illegal memory access.
- **Validate Memory Operations in CUDA**: Ensure that all CUDA **memory operations** are valid and avoid uninitialized or freed memory to prevent errors.
   - Adding error checking around CUDA API calls can help catch issues early in the code.
- **Review Custom CUDA Kernels**: Users should carefully check array indexing in **custom CUDA kernels** to prevent out-of-bounds memory accesses.
   - Using **Compute Sanitizer** can help identify memory access issues more effectively during debugging.

- **MaskBit revolutionizes image generation**: The paper on [MaskBit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16211) presents an embedding-free image generation model that operates on bit tokens, achieving a state-of-the-art FID of **1.52** on the ImageNet **256 × 256** benchmark.
   - It also provides an insightful examination of **VQGANs**, resulting in a high-performing model that enhances accessibility while revealing previously unknown details.
- **MonoFormer merges autoregression and diffusion**: The [MonoFormer paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16280) proposes a unified transformer architecture for both autoregressive text generation and diffusion-based image generation, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art models.
   - This is made possible by leveraging the similarities in training for both methods, differing only in the attention masks used during training.
- **Sliding window attention still relies on positional encoding**: A member noted that while **sliding window attention** (similar to Longformer) provides benefits, it still incorporates a **positional encoding** mechanism.
   - This raises further discussion about the balance between efficiency and the need to maintain positional awareness in model architecture.
