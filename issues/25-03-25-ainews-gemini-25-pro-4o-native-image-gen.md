## Gemini 2.5 Pro

[**Gemini 2.5 Pro**](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43473489) is the new undisputed top model in the world, a whopping 40 LMarena points over Grok 3 from just last month ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-xai-grok-3-and-mira-muratis-thinking/)), with [Noam Shazeer's involvement](https://twitter.com/NoamShazeer/status/1904581813215125787) hinting that the learnings from Flash Thinking have been merged into Pro (odd how 2.5 Pro came out first before 2.5 Flash?)

Pricing is not yet announced but you can use it as a **free**, rate limited "experimental model" today.

## GPT 4o Native Images

Hot on the heels of [yesterday's Reve Image](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-halfmoon-is-reve-image-a-new-sota-image/) and [Gemini's Native Image Gen](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-gemma-3-beats-deepseek-v3-in-elo-20-flash/), OpenAI finally released their 4o native image gen with a [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/live/2f3K43FHRKo?si=QX6oXEalK8XRSvrP), [blogpost](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43474112), and [system card](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-image-generation-system-card-addendum/) confirming that it is an autoregressive model. The most detail we'll probably get from now about how it works, is this image from [Allan Jabri](https://x.com/ajabri/status/1904599427366739975) who worked on the original 4o image gen that was never released (then taken over by [Gabe Goh as sama credits him](https://x.com/sama/status/1904599358756315341)).

- **lm_eval Upgrade PR Awaits Review**: A pull request (PR) is open to update the evaluation logic in `gpt-neox` to `lm_eval==0.4.8`, the latest version, with potentially unrelated failing tests to be addressed in a separate PR, as linked here: [PR 1348](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/pull/1348).
   - Failures might be due to environment setup or inconsistent versioning of dependencies.

## [Modular (Mojo 🔥)](https://discord.com/channels/1087530497313357884) Discord

- **Mojo Sidelined for Websites**: Members advised against using **Mojo** for websites due to its lack of specifications for cryptographically sound code and a weak IO story, favoring **Rust** for its production-ready libraries.
   - It was suggested that **Rust's** faster async capabilities are better suited for applications requiring authentication or **HTTPS**.
- **Mojo's Hardware-Backed AES Implementation Paused**: A hardware-backed **AES** implementation in **Mojo** doesn't run on older Apple silicon Macs and isn't a full **TLS** implementation, leading to a pause in development.
   - The developer is waiting for a cryptographer to write the software half, citing risks of cryptographic functions implemented by non-experts.
- **SIMD Optimizations Boost AES**: Discussion centered on using **SIMD** for **AES**, noting that **x86** has **vaes** and similar features for **SIMD AES 128**.
   - It was also mentioned that **ARM** has **SVE AES**, which is similar but not as well supported, showcasing hardware optimizations for cryptographic functions.
- **Go Floated as a Backend Middle Ground**: As an alternative to **Rust**, a member suggested **Go** as a middle ground that is also production ready, while another expressed concerns about too many microservices.
   - Despite the challenges, a member expressed reluctance towards **Rust** due to the perception that it's not suitable for fast writing, seeking an easier solution for backend development, and the suggestion was to have the **Rust API call into it** and pass arguments along.
- **Mojo Bypasses CUDA with PTX for NVIDIA**: **Mojo** directly generates **PTX** (Parallel Thread Execution) code to target NVIDIA GPUs, bypassing **CUDA** and eliminating dependencies on **cuBLAS**, **cuDNN**, and **CUDA C**.
   - This approach streamlines the development process by avoiding the need for **CUDA**-specific libraries.

## [DSPy](https://discord.com/channels/1161519468141355160) Discord

- **DSPy tackles Summarization Task**: A member is exploring using **DSPy** for a text summarization task with **300** examples and is testing it out on a simple metric to see where exactly the summarization differed to make the optimizer more effective.
   - The feedback can be returned via `dspy.Prediction(score=your_metric_score, feedback="stuff about the ground truth or how the two things differ")` to guide the optimization.
- **SIMBA Provides Granular Feedback**: A member suggested using the experimental optimizer `dspy.SIMBA` for the summarization task, which allows for providing feedback on differences between the generated summary and the ground truth.
   - This level of feedback allows for more precise guidance during the optimization process.
- **Output Refinement with BestOfN and Refine**: A member shared a link to a [DSPy tutorial on Output Refinement](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/output_refinement/best-of-n-and-refine/) explaining `BestOfN` and `Refine` modules designed to improve prediction reliability.
   - The tutorial elaborates on how both modules stop when they have reached `N` attempts or when the `reward_fn` returns an award above the `threshold`.
- **BestOfN Module Triumphs with Temperature Tweaks**: The `BestOfN` module runs a given module multiple times with different temperature settings to get an optimal result.
   - It returns either the first prediction that passes a specified threshold or the one with the highest reward if none meet the threshold.
- **Refine Module Composable?**: A member inquired if `Refine` is going to subsume assertions, and whether it's as granular and composable, since it wraps an entire module.
   - Another member responded that the composability can be managed by adjusting the module size, allowing for more explicit control over the scope.

## [tinygrad (George Hotz)](https://discord.com/channels/1068976834382925865) Discord

- **AMD Legacy GPUs get tinygrad bump**: With the **OpenCL frontend**, older AMD GPUs (not supported by ROCm) such as those in a 2013 Mac Pro *can* potentially run with Tinygrad.
   - Success depends on the *custom driver* and level of OpenCL support available; users should verify their system compatibility.
- **ROCm Alternative emerges for Old AMD**: For older AMD GPUs, ROCm lacks support but the **OpenCL frontend** in tinygrad might offer a workaround.
   - Success will vary based on specific driver versions and the extent of OpenCL support; experimentation is needed.

> `Augment vs Cursor codebase analysis, Claude 3.7 MAX vs Claude 3.7, Vibe Coder & MCPs, New Deepseek V3 and Gemini 2.5, ASI Singularity` 


- **Augment Beats Cursor for Codebase Analysis**: Members discussed why [Augment](https://www.augment.app/) is better at analyzing large codebases compared to Cursor, with one stating that it *uses full context*.
   - Some suggested that Augment uses a different system to search files, not just feeding the entire codebase into the LLM, and suggested using **Claude 3.7 Max** for full context instead.
- **Debate on Claude 3.7 MAX Full Context**: The difference between **Claude 3.7 MAX** and **Claude 3.7** is that MAX has full context while the non-MAX version has limited context and 25 agent calls before needing to resume.
   - This limitation refers to both context window and the amount of context added in a single prompt.
- **Vibe Coder's Knowledge Cutoff Risks**: The Vibe coder could be in trouble if they don't use **Model Context Protocols (MCPs)** to mitigate the cut-off knowledge of LLMs and code translation for the next version may be difficult.
   - It's critical to update frameworks because most AI uses out-of-date frameworks that are susceptible to errors that might go unnoticed, but you can use MCPs such as **Exa Search** or **Brave Search** to mitigate this for Claude.
- **Deepseek V3 challenges Claude 3.7**: The new **Deepseek V3** is shown to outperform Claude 3.5 (and maybe 3.7) in several tests, and new data also shows the release of a real-world coding benchmark for **Deepseek V3 (0324)**.
   - The new Deepseek V3 model is considered impressive, with one member suggesting that using **Deepseek V3 Latest (Cline) as Architect + Sonnet 3.5 as Executioner (Cursor)** could be a solid coding approach.
- **The ASI Singularity is coming!**: The discussion focused on **achieving ASI Singularity (Godsend) soon** to preempt potential AI-related chaos, while a member commented that  A lot of stuff is getting dragged out on purpose while a lot of people live lives like it will last forever.
   - Members talked about how true AGI is unachievable due to not understanding our brain completely, or an LLM's limitations, but the new AGI is more so *a Super-System that uses LLMs + Algorithmic software + robotics*.

> `Deepseek API Usage with Aider, LLM Hallucinations, Aider's Architecture Mode, NotebookLM for Context Priming, OpenRouter Configuration Issues` 


- **Deepseek's API Hallucinates as GPT-4**: Users reported that when using **DeepSeek's API** through Aider, the model incorrectly identifies itself as **OpenAI's GPT-4**, despite correct API key configuration and confirmed usage on the DeepSeek platform.
   - The phenomenon seems related to training data containing frequent mentions of ChatGPT, as discussed in this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/15yvc5j/why_do_llama2_models_always_claim_they_are/).
- **NotebookLM Boosts Aider's Context**: A user suggested leveraging **NotebookLM** to enhance Aider's context priming process, particularly for large, unfamiliar codebases using [RepoMix](https://github.com/simonireilly/repo-mix).
   - The suggested workflow involves repomixing the repo, adding it to NotebookLM, including relevant task references, and then querying NotebookLM for relevant files, implementation suggestions, and a comprehensive plan to guide prompting in Aider.
- **OpenRouter Aliases Trigger Litellm Errors**: A user encountered a `litellm.APIConnectionError` when attempting to use **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** via **OpenRouter**, with other models working fine.
   - Another user replicated the configuration successfully, suggesting the issue may be specific to the user's OpenRouter setup rather than Aider itself; see this [Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1131200896827654144/1349300906864279584).
- **DeepSeek V3 Impresses Aider's Homepage**: Paul Gauthier tested the new **DeepSeek V3** model on the Aider homepage, noting its suggestion to upgrade the emojis to SVG icons.
   - See the [tweet](https://x.com/paulgauthier/status/1904310818868785196?s=46&t=AkDCTtZVFFazuKDknG6fLA) for more details.
- **Aider Configuration with thinking-tokens**: A user asked how to use `--thinking-tokens` when launching aider.
   - Another user linked the [sample configuration file](https://aider.chat/docs/config/aider_conf.html#sample-yaml-config-file), explaining that it should be a top-level key in `.aider.conf.yml`.

> `HF Transformers, Deepseek model patching, FP8 Loading Scheme, Quantization impact on model performance, GGUF Uploads` 


- **Transformer Best Bets, Says User**: Members recommend **Hugging Face Transformers**, books on **linear algebra**, and learning **PyTorch** as the best approach.
   - One member suggests setting up a **dynamic quantization** at runtime schema with **HF Transformers** to stream weights to **FP4/FP8** with **Bits and Bytes** as they load.
- **Sneaky Model Patches, Says User**: According to one user, companies like **Deepseek** sometimes patch models before releasing the weights.
   - They add that at the very least a naive **FP8 loading scheme** could still be done on day zero, though it wouldn't be equivalent in quality to a fine-grained FP8 assignment.
- **Quantization Hurts? Say It Ain't So!**: A member warns that naively quantizing can significantly hurt model performance.
   - They asked, *Tbh, is there even a reason to run new models on day zero? I feel like it's really not a great burden to just wait a week.*
- **GGUF Uploads Incoming!**: According to one user, Unsloth is uploading **DeepSeek-V3-0324 GGUFs** with Dynamic Quants that are *selectively quantized*.
   - These **Dynamic Quants** will greatly improve accuracy over standard bits, so sit tight!
- **Llama 3 + Vision Collab Issues**: Members reports an issue trying to train **gemma3 4b** for vision, which raises the **RuntimeError**: *expected scalar type BFloat16 but found float*.
   - One member recommends trying [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Gemma3_(4B).ipynb), while another confirms that **Gemma3 finetuning** is supported for non-bf16 devices when using the notebooks on Colab.

> `Deepseek facts learning, Unsloth Gemma 3 27b error, phi4 fine tuning with unsloth, Medical bot fine tuning, LightRAG issues` 


- ****Deepseek Learns New Tricks**?**: A user inquired about tools to teach **Deepseek** additional facts via conversation or inserting data points into the training model for use as a personal assistant.
   - The user was *thinking in terms of using it as a personal assistant with figures and facts and dates etc.*
- ****Gemma 3 Glitch Gives Grief****: A user encountered a `TypeError` when loading `unsloth/gemma-3-27b-it-unsloth-bnb-4bit` for text-only finetuning due to redundant `finetune_vision_layers` parameter.
   - Another user pointed out that `FastLanguageModel` already sets `finetune_vision_layers = False` under the hood as seen in [Unsloth's GitHub](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/blob/e80d642bc777f7a219bdd34aea1a77751f066785/unsloth/models/llama.py#L2034).
- ****Fine-Tuning Mishap: Model Merging Mayhem****: A user who completed a **phi4** fine-tuning with Unsloth inquired whether to merge LORA adapters with only the "lamafied" version or if a generic base **phi4** model can be used.
   - A member said *I guess you can do both, but better with same model as use during training*.
- ****Fine-Tuning for the Future Medics****: A user seeks guidance on building an end-to-end medical bot through fine-tuning **Llama** using Unsloth, asking for advice on where to start.
   - No actionable advice was given.
- ****Visionary Void: Mistral 3.1's Image Issues****: A user reported issues with **Mistral 3.1** not processing images correctly in a local **Ollama** instance, with the model outputting nonsensical responses to image inputs.
   - The problem may be related to the mmproj file not getting loaded according to users, the *model lose[s] the vision abilities*.

> `GRPO limitations, FFN Fusion for LLMs, DAPO experiments, AI Project Job Spam, Transformer Talk` 


- **GRPO Gotchas Galore**: Members are tweaking GRPO (Gradient Ratio Policy Optimization) to correctly train 2+ turns, as it currently only supports prompt/completion and found [this helpful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3b59lZYBW8).
   - The member is also curious if new neural models or hybrid evolutionary neural approaches might help solve problems like arc.
- **FFN Fusion Frenzy Fuels Faster LLMs**: [FFN Fusion](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18908) is introduced as an architectural optimization technique that reduces sequential computation in large language models by identifying and exploiting natural opportunities for parallelization.
   - This technique transforms sequences of **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)** layers into parallel operations, significantly reducing **inference latency** while preserving **model behavior**.
- **Transformer Talk Transcends Traditional Thinking**: A member shared [a YouTube talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAspMnu4Rt0) on transformers that they found insightful, opening up a bunch of areas for investigation.
   - Another member wondered if there is a metric to find very early in training to allow for model fusion before fully training the model.
- **DAPO Discussions Derail, Demand Data**: Multiple members are curious if anyone has experimented with DAPO (likely **Direct Preference Optimization**), or tried to recreate results with **verl**.
   - One member posted an image, possibly related to DAPO results, seeking confirmation of replication, but details remain unclear.

> `Qwen VL series training details, Qwerky-72B transformerless model, Gemini 2.5 Pro performance, 4o image generation, AI Studio vs Gemini Advanced` 


- **Qwen VL Series Needs DeepSeek-Style Training Deets**: A member expressed a desire for a [DeepSeek-R1 style paper](https://www.deepseek.com/blog/deepseek-r1-a-strongly-competitive-open-source-language-model) with comprehensive training details for the **Qwen VL series**.
   - The poster hoped for *tons of training details* including parameters, training compute and dataset mixtures.
- **Qwerky-72B Ditches Attention, Nears 4o-Mini**: Featherless AI introduced [Qwerky-72B and 32B](https://substack.recursal.ai/p/qwerky-72b-and-32b-training-large), transformerless models trained on **8 GPUs** that *surpass GPT 3.5 Turbo and approach 4o-mini* in evals with 100x lower inference cost using RWKV linear scaling.
   - The training process involved *freezing all weights, deleting the attention layer, replacing it with RWKV, and training it through multiple stages*.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Snags #1 Spot, Google Mogs OAI**: **Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental**, codenamed *Nebula*, achieved the #1 spot on the [LMArena leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/?lea), outperforming **Grok-3/GPT-4.5** by a record-breaking margin and leading in Math, Creative Writing, and Multi-Turn.
   - The model also dominates the [SEAL leaderboards](https://scale.com/leaderboard), with first-place rankings in Humanity’s Last Exam and VISTA (multimodal).
- **4o Image Gen Gives Unsolicited Makeovers**: **GPT-4o's native image generation** is criticized for applying excessive edits, such as *making eyes bigger* and altering facial features, even changing the user's appearance, as demonstrated in [this twitter thread](https://fxtwitter.com/TheXeophon/status/1904602649225285922).
   - Some users reported that altering a single word in their prompts results in failures.
- **AI Studio is for Devs, Gemini Advanced an Ugly ChatGPT Clone**: Members discussed the utility of Google's AI platforms, with some asserting that [AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) is better for developers due to its broader model selection, code execution capabilities, and YouTube support.
   - Members felt that [Gemini Advanced](https://gemini.google.com/) *is a bad ChatGPT clone* and *has no reason* to use for power users, and suggested a more streamlined platform focused on developer tools.

- **Home Inference Favors vLLM with Caveats**: The best solution for efficient home inference of LLMs with the ability to switch out models on the fly is likely **vLLM**, despite quirks with quant support, though **ollama** is easier to use but lags in support and **SGLang** looks compelling.
   - It was suggested to play around with **llama.cpp** to see how it's going these days.
- **AIBrix from vLLM Team Could Autoscale Models**: A member wondered if something like **AIBrix** from the vLLM team would work, using **vLLM + Kubernetes** to autoscale models to 0 for seamless swapping; [here's an article on that](https://aibrix.github.io/posts/2025-02-20-vllm-control-plane/#advanced-llm-gateway-and-routing-strategies).
   - The smallest viable cluster without quant is two **8xH100** nodes due to vram requirements, though a single **H200** node (**8x141**) would suffice.
- **Model Evals are Surprisingly Time-Consuming**: Internal and external **model evals** are surprisingly time-consuming, requiring a custom UI for making the Eval (**Sonnet + streamlit**) and **a UI to view the data**.
   - It's useful to do **1-2 trials runs with a cheap model** to catch failure modes and re-word/discard prompts.
- **OpenAI API Scaling Requires Caution**: When using **OpenAI**'s API at scale, their dashboard isn't accurate and their spending controls don't work, which may lead to negative balances even with inference.
   - When using **OpenRouter**, you can specify that you want bf16/fp16 for models, as well as setting `max_tokens` and `temperature`.

> `Add and Sigmoid vs Add and Norm, Scaling Experts at Inference Time, Transformers without Normalization, LLM-Emulated Raytracing, Indirect Image Generation with LLMs` 


- **Add and Sigmoid: The New Norm?**: A member suggested replacing `add` and `norm` with `add` and **sigmoid** in transformer architectures, particularly for Mixture of Experts (**MoE**), to facilitate easier scaling of experts.
   - Theorizing that *if the gate has a sigmoid activation function, this should allow us to add or remove other experts without much problems* because the scaling becomes independent of the number of neighboring values.
- **Transformers get TANHed**: Drawing from the recent [Transformers without Normalization paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05442), one member noted that replacing normalization with **tanh** is a viable strategy.
   - The concern raised was the impact on smaller weights when removing experts at inference time, but another countered that the **top_k** gate mechanism would still function effectively by selecting from the remaining experts.
- **Raytracing Emulated by LLMs, no NVIDIA code involved**: Members discussed the idea of using an **LLM** to emulate a **raytracing algorithm**, clarifying that the current implementation involves a **Python** program written by the LLM to generate images indirectly.
   - It's *next level text to image generation* because the LLM writes the program rather than generating the image directly, the programs are available in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cpldcpu/llmbenchmark/tree/master/raytracer).
- **Normalization Debate: Sigmoid Scales Without Neighbors**: The discussion continued on the need to remove normalization when **top_k** is constant, with one member arguing that normalization changes values relative to neighboring values.
   - They explained that using **sigmoid** for scaling would avoid this dependency, enabling the addition of more experts without significantly altering existing values.

   - Despite a spokesperson for **Andreessen Horowitz** denying rumors of legal action, concerns persist about **11x’s** financial status and potentially inflated revenue figures, with some suggesting the company's growth relies on hype and that real enterprise sales leaders are not seeing value in AI SDRs.
- **Databricks Unveils TAO to Tune LLMs Without Labels**: The **Databricks** research team announced **TAO**, a method to tune LLMs for a task without data labels, using test-time compute and RL, [as described in their blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/tao-using-test-time-compute-train-efficient-llms-without-labeled-data).
   - They claim it outperforms supervised fine-tuning and scales with compute to produce fast, high-quality models.

- **CUDA Async Warpgroup Swizzling Examined**: A member analyzed **CUDA's async warpgroup swizzle TF32** layout, questioning the non-consecutive numbers in the first row and the starting number determination for each subpartition, referencing the [NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#async-warpgroup-k-32b-swizzle-tf32).
   - They later identified the layout as `Swizzle<0,4,3> o ((8,2),(4,4)):((4,32),(1,64))`, enabling construction of the original data position and combining it with `Swizzle<1,4,3>`.
- **Flash Attention Layout Questioned**: A member questioned why **Flash Attention** does not use a `(batch_size, num_heads, N, d)` memory layout, suggesting it might be superior to the existing `(batch_size, N, num_heads, d)` layout.
   - The user found their prior attempts using this layout went *horribly wrong*, based on an example from [NVIDIA's CUDA-C Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#example-matrix-transpose).
- **Discrepancies in cuTensorMap Parameters**: A member highlighted a discrepancy between the **box_size** parameter definition in a CUDA example (bytes) and the cuTensorMapEncodeTiled documentation (elements), referencing a [CUDA-C Programming Guide example](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#example-matrix-transpose).
   - The user also noted that `box_size` is in reverse order compared to the shared memory size of `int4 [8][8]`.
- **Mapping Coordinates in CuTe Fragments**: A member asked about the easiest way in **CuTe** to map coordinates inside a fragment owned by a thread created from `tiled_mma.get_thread_slice(tid)` back to the coordinates of the whole resulting matrix.

> `PyTorch allocator, torch.nn.utils.prune` 


- **PyTorch Caching Allocator Impedes Non-Caching Alternatives**: A user noted the difficulty of using a *non-caching* allocator alongside **PyTorch's caching allocator**, because MemPool uses the custom allocator with caching, which is not ideal.
- **Concerns Raised on PyTorch's Caching Allocator**: A user wondered why companies might avoid alternative caching allocators in production, citing concerns about debugging tools.
   - They expressed uncertainty about the magic behind the **PyTorch caching allocator** that would prevent using alternatives.
- **Pruning already pruned weights in torch.nn.utils.prune leads to wrong pruning ratios**: A user reported that `torch.nn.utils.prune` doesn't allow pruning to be applied only to non-pruned weights when pruning an already pruned layer.
   - They found that applying pruning twice with an amount of **0.2** does not result in a final amount of **0.4** due to re-pruning already pruned weights.

> `Iterative Pruning, Double Pruning Weights, Pruning Ratio Calculations` 


- **Pruning Weights Twice Causes Problems**: A user reported that when applying pruning to an already pruned layer using `torch.nn.utils.prune`, there's no direct option to prune only non-pruned weights.
   - The user notes that applying a pruning ratio creates a global mask that affects the entire tensor, potentially re-pruning already pruned weights, leading to an incorrect final pruning ratio.
- **Simple Iteration does not fix Pruning Weights Twice**: A member asked if applying a ratio of **0.2** in the first iteration, then **0.4** in the second iteration on the already pruned weights, achieves the desired outcome.
   - The original poster responded that masks respect already defined masks, so you need calculate the new pruning ratio on the already pruned layer (or network) to arrive at the desired ratio.

   - The root cause appears to be that the CUDA source code couldn't compile properly, as indicated by the error message: *Error building extension 'conv2d_module'*.
- **Confirmation of module issues by other users**: Another user suggested that the issue might be related to a wrong or missing module, specifically mentioning uncertainty about `load_inline` function in `/root/submission.py`, line 191.
   - The original poster acknowledges the feedback and plans to investigate the module and `load_inline` function further, with no further information.

- **3090 Ti Fully Loaded**: One user showcased their **3090 Ti** being fully loaded, showing *pure speed* in a [screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1153759714082033735/1354073319133155429/image.png).
   - They reported speeds of **~20 tokens/s** without flash and slowing down after **4-5k tokens**, and **~30 tokens/s** with flash.
- **M4 Max Power Spike with 32B Thinking Models**: A user noted that **32B-class thinking models** drive power higher on their **M4 Max** (up to **140W**) compared to same or larger sized models (up to **120W**).
   - The user guesses this is due to *more aggressive memory access*, because *the gpus seem to be running roughly the same*.
- **ROCm Support Updates for AMD GPUs**: A user asked about support for the latest AMD GPUs and another user mentioned that it's *only through Vulkan*, lacking **ROCm** support in master llama.cpp releases.
   - Another member clarified that the ROCm llama.cpp engine is updated along with CUDA and Vulkan, but noted that support for certain AMD GPUs like the **90xx** may be a separate question.

> `CUDA overhead, Cursed Submodule, vLLM + GRPO, r1-zero` 


- **Banish CPU CUDA Launch Overhead with Graph Capture**: To reduce GPU idle time, members discussed that launching CUDA operations from CPU has non-negligible overhead and that capturing GPU operations as a graph and launching them as a single operation can consolidate the computational graph.
   - One member asked if this is what compile does.
- **Is a /cursed submodule needed to improve Performance 10x?**: Members debated the creation of a `/cursed` submodule for *cursed code* that drastically improves performance, like manual CUDA device specification.
   - A member stated that he is using an approach only suitable for smaller models, where each process has its vLLM instance that generates data, instead of the more common approach of having a centralized vLLM generating process.
- **vLLM & GRPO Integration: smaller models vs. larger models**: A member has a working version for distributed setups, but stopped iterating on it after being notified that some work is already done internally.
   - The current approach is supposedly better for smaller models (up to 8B), whereas the internal approach would be better for large models (>=70B).
- **r1-zero Recipe for Async Training**: A member shared a [link to r1-zero](https://github.com/joecummings/r1-zero/blob/main/scripts/runnable_recipe_ray_vllm_weight_sync.py) for async training of reasoning models, emphasizing it's still a work in progress.
   - They also mentioned plans to integrate a version of this recipe into torchtune soon, focusing on cleaning up and allowing non-HF models with vLLM.
- **Layer GPU Address Mapping via HTTP Calls**: A member suggested modifying **vLLM** to launch with a mapping of each layer's GPU address.
   - The goal is to run a vLLM process on the side and interact with it via HTTP calls; someone is already *working on it*.

- **Privacy Laws Challenge Chat Data Analysis**: One member raised concerns about privacy laws, particularly in the EU, and the need to ensure compliance when processing chat data.
   - The discussion highlighted the importance of verifying permissions and the format of the chat messages (plaintext or convertible) before feeding them into an LLM.
- **LLM API vs Local LLM for Chat Processing**: A member inquired about whether to use a paid API like **Deepseek** or **OpenAI**, or to run a local LLM for processing incoming group chat messages to calculate satisfaction rates, extract keywords, and summarize messages.
   - Another member suggested that if the messages are relatively small (under **100MB**), a local machine with a good GPU might suffice, especially if using smaller models for labeling and summarization.
- **LocalDocs DB Importing Challenges**: Members discussed the possibility of importing a `localdocs.db` file, but noted that the file contains encrypted/specially encoded text, making it difficult for a generic LLM to parse without an embedding model.
   - One member who lost their localdocs.db was experiencing painfully slow CPU indexing and was hoping to get around this problem.
- **Win11 Update Wipes LocalDocs**: A member experienced their `localdocs.db` becoming empty after a Windows 11 update and was struggling to re-index the local documents on CPU.
   - Drive letter changes due to the update were considered as a possible cause, with a suggestion to move files to the C drive to avoid such issues.

> `SkyLadder short-to-long context window transition, Data-constrained pretraining for math, Composable Generalization` 


- **SkyLadder: Short-to-Long Context is the Optimal Path**: A paper on ArXiv proposes **SkyLadder**, a simple yet effective approach that implements a **short-to-long context window transition** for LLM pretraining, yielding consistent gains of up to **3.7%** on common tasks ([2503.15450](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15450)).
   - The authors pre-train **1B** and **3B** parameter models on **100B tokens**, demonstrating that **SkyLadder** preserves strong standard benchmark performance while matching or exceeding baseline results on long context tasks.
- **Human Thought: The Key to Data-Constrained Pretraining?**: A new approach suggests that explicitly modeling and inferring the **latent thoughts** that underlie the text generation process can significantly improve pretraining data efficiency, especially for math ([2503.18866](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18866)).
   - The paper empirically demonstrates the effectiveness of inferring latent thoughts through synthetic data approaches, outperforming training on the same amount of raw data (**5.7% -> 25.4%**).
- **Composable Generalization Through Hypernetworks!**: A paper reformulates multi-head attention as a **hypernetwork**, revealing that a composable, low-dimensional latent code specifies key-query specific operations, enabling transformers to generalize to novel problem instances ([2406.05816](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05816)).
   - One member liked that *for a single pair of q, k indices, the authors interpret activations along the head-number dimension as a latent code (of dimension n_heads) specifying the task / context*.

> `Chinchilla Scaling Formula, Impact of Suboptimal Hyperparameters, Learning Rate Effects` 


- **Digging into **Chinchilla Scaling Formula****: A member inquired how suboptimal hyperparameter settings affect the **Chinchilla scaling formula** for optimal model training across different scales, referencing the [Chinchilla paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556).
   - Specifically, they asked which parameters (**E**, **A**, **B**, **alpha**, or **beta**) in the formula would be altered if the **learning rate** was set too low (e.g., 1/10 of the optimal value).
- **Learning Rate's Ripple Effects**: The inquiry focuses on the theoretical consequences of a suboptimal **learning rate** on the scaling behavior predicted by the **Chinchilla formula**.
   - It aims to understand if a consistently low **learning rate** would primarily affect the **error term (E)**, the scaling coefficients (**A**, **B**), or the exponents (**alpha**, **beta**) governing the relationship between model size, training data, and performance.

> `Mojo for Website vs Rust, AES in Mojo Progress, SIMD for AES, Rust vs Go for Backend` 


- **Mojo Unsuitable for Websites Compared to Rust**: A member inquired about using **Mojo** for websites versus **Rust**, but was advised against it due to **Mojo's** lack of specification for cryptographically sound code and a lacking IO story.
   - The suggestion was to use **Rust** with its production-ready libraries and frameworks, and its faster async capabilities, especially for applications requiring authentication or HTTPS.
- **Hardware-Backed AES in Mojo on Hold**: A member mentioned having a hardware-backed **AES** implementation in **Mojo**, but it doesn't run on older Apple silicon Macs and is not a full TLS implementation.
   - The developer is holding off on further **AES** work until a cryptographer is willing to write the software half, emphasizing the risks of non-experts implementing cryptographic functions.
- **SIMD for AES Implementations Explored**: Discussion involved using **SIMD** for **AES** and other algorithms, with a member noting that **x86** has **vaes** and similar features for **SIMD AES 128**.
   - It was mentioned that **ARM** has **SVE AES**, which is similar but not as well supported, highlighting hardware-level optimizations available for cryptographic functions.
- **Rust API to call into MAX**: Despite the challenges, a member expressed reluctance towards **Rust** due to the perception that it's not suitable for fast writing, seeking an easier solution for backend development, and the suggestion was to have the **Rust API call into it** and pass arguments along.
   - They were considering using **Python** but found it slow and unstable, leading to a plan to create a **Rust** project callable via **FFI**.
- **Go as a Middle Ground**: As an alternative, a member suggested **Go** as a decent middle ground that is also production ready, between Python/Mojo and Rust.
   - However, another member expressed concerns that too many microservices could make the project very big.

> `CUDA-free, PTX for targeting NVIDIA GPUs` 


- **PTX Powers 'CUDA-Free' Mojo on NVIDIA**: Mojo directly generates **PTX** (Parallel Thread Execution) code to target NVIDIA GPUs, bypassing the need for CUDA.
   - This approach avoids dependencies on **cuBLAS**, **cuDNN**, and **CUDA C**, streamlining the development process.
- **Details on CUDA Free**: Confirmed by bradlarson, the team generates PTX directly and lowers from there.
   - There is *no* dependency on cuBLAS, cuDNN, or CUDA C.

> `Text Summarization with DSPy, SIMBA Optimizer, Output Refinement vs Assertions, BestOfN Module, Refine Module` 


- **Summarization Task Tackled with DSPy**: A member is exploring using **DSPy** for a text summarization task with **300** examples from an expert and is testing it out on a simple metric.
   - They are wondering if the optimizer can be more effective if it sees where exactly the summarization differed, and if there's a better approach to optimizing a prompt for text summarization.
- **SIMBA Optimizer Supports Granular Feedback**: A member suggested using the experimental optimizer `dspy.SIMBA` for the summarization task, which allows for providing feedback on differences between the generated summary and the ground truth.
   - The feedback can be returned via `dspy.Prediction(score=your_metric_score, feedback="stuff about the ground truth or how the two things differ")` to guide the optimization.
- **Output Refinement Doc Shared**: A member shared a link to a [DSPy tutorial on Output Refinement](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/output_refinement/best-of-n-and-refine/) explaining `BestOfN` and `Refine` modules designed to improve prediction reliability by making multiple LM calls with different parameter settings.
   - The tutorial elaborates on how both modules stop when they have reached `N` attempts or when the `reward_fn` returns an award above the `threshold`.
- **BestOfN Module improves with Temperature Tweaks**: The `BestOfN` module runs a given module multiple times with different temperature settings to get an optimal result.
   - It returns either the first prediction that passes a specified threshold or the one with the highest reward if none meet the threshold.
- **Refine Module not as Composable?**: A member inquired if `Refine` is going to subsume assertions, and whether it's as granular and composable, since it wraps an entire module.
   - Another member responded that the composability can be managed by adjusting the module size, allowing for more explicit control over the scope.

> `ROCm Support, OpenCL Front End, AMD GPUs with Tinygrad` 


- **Legacy AMD GPUs get Tinygrad Boost**: Using **OpenCL frontend**, older AMD GPUs not supported by ROCm, such as those in a 2013 Mac Pro, *can* potentially run with Tinygrad.
   - The success may depend on the specific driver and the level of OpenCL support available on the system, so users should verify their *custom driver* compatibility.
- **ROCm Alternative for Older AMD**: ROCm does not support older AMD GPUs, but the **OpenCL frontend** in tinygrad might offer a workaround.
   - Success will vary based on specific driver versions and the extent of OpenCL support; experimentation is needed to confirm compatibility.
