date: '2024-05-17T20:46:44.950821Z'
original_slug: ainews-chameleon-metas-unreleased-gpt4o-like
description: >-
  **Meta AI FAIR** introduced **Chameleon**, a new multimodal model family with
  **7B** and **34B** parameter versions trained on **10T tokens** of interleaved
  text and image data enabling "early fusion" multimodality that can natively
  output any modality. While reasoning benchmarks are modest, its "omnimodality"
  approach competes well with pre-GPT4o multimodal models. **OpenAI** launched
  **GPT-4o**, a model excelling in benchmarks like MMLU and coding tasks, with
  strong multimodal capabilities but some regression in ELO scores and
  hallucination issues. **Google DeepMind** announced **Gemini 1.5 Flash**, a
  small model with **1M context window** and flash performance, highlighting
  convergence trends between OpenAI and Google models. **Anthropic** updated
  **Claude 3** with streaming support, forced tool use, and vision tool
  integration for multimodal knowledge extraction. OpenAI also partnered with
  Reddit, raising industry attention.

> AI News for 5/16/2024-5/17/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**429** channels, and **5221** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **551 minutes**.

[Armen Aghajanyan](https://x.com/ArmenAgha/status/1791275549815648473) introduced [Chameleon](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09818), FAIR's latest work on multimodal models, training 7B and 34B models on 10T tokens of text and image (independent and interleaved) data resulting in an "early fusion" form of multimodality (as compared to Flamingo and LLaVA) that can natively *output* any modality as easily as it consumes them:

As just a 34B model, the reasoning benchmarks aren't something to write home about, but the "omnimodality" approach compares well with peer multimodal modals pre GPT4-o:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/31847dd3-109e-49a3-aaef-86b8033a943d.png?w=960&fit=max) 

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/397fc517-615f-40e6-92ee-430fedcdcf26.png?w=960&fit=max) 

As you might imagine, the tokenization matters a lot, and this is what we know so far:

The dataset description sounds straightforward, but since model, code and data remain unreleased, we are left merely considering the theoretical advantages of their approach right now. But it's nice that Meta is clearly not far off from releasing their own "early fusion mixed modality", GPT4-class model.

- **LMSys Leaderboard updated with GPT-4o**: LMSys has updated their leaderboard to include GPT-4o, but some users are disappointed with its performance, noting specific points in coding benchmarks. One user remarked, "The code benchmark dropped 50 points from here."

- **Humans mistake GPT-4 for people in Turing test**: [A preprint](https://x.com/camrobjones/status/1790766472458903926?s=46) claims that GPT-4 is judged to be human 54% of the time in Turing tests, cited as "the most robust evidence to date" of passing the Turing test.

- **Debate on OpenAI departures linked to lack of AGI progress**: Some users speculate that recent departures from OpenAI are due to a perceived lack of progress towards AGI, rather than detecting any imminent danger. As @deki04 shared, *"The Safety team left not because they saw something but because they saw nothing."*

- **GPT-4o's output structure criticized**: Users criticize GPT-4o for its generic response patterns, preferring more tailored and problem-solving responses. One comment noted, "8 out of 10 responses are just enumerations of steps, rather than a simple reasoning."

- **Excitement and skepticism around new AI integration**: There's palpable excitement over [GPT-4o’s multimodal capabilities](https://fxtwitter.com/VictorTaelin/status/1790185366693024155), especially in handling complex tasks like *Pokémon Red* gameplay in a terminal. However, there's also skepticism regarding its training architecture and output efficacy compared to solely text-trained models.

- **Recompute Optimization Wins**: Implementing the [optimization](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/422) that recomputes forward activations during the backward pass led to a memory reduction of **5706 MiB to 5178 MiB (10%)** and throughput increase of **6%**. *"Previously I could only fit batch size 10, now I can fit batch size 12."*
- **CUDA Memcpy Async Behavior**: Discussion on whether `cudaMemcpyAsync` and regular `cudaMemcpy` exhibits asynchronous behavior with respect to the CPU, with a [reference to CUDA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__MEMORY.html#group__CUDART__MEMORY_1gf7338650f7683c51ee26aadc6973c63a). Conclusion suggests that this behavior is not entirely clear and could vary based on use cases.
- **ZeRO Optimization Insights**: The ZeRO-1 optimization provides significant communication reductions and throughput improvements, with **training speeds increasing from 45K tok/s to 50K tok/s**. Discussions indicate a preference towards **ZeRO-1** over **ZeRO-0** due to lower code complexity and improved performance.
- **NVMe Direct GPU Writes**: Introduction of [ssd-gpu-dma](https://github.com/enfiskutensykkel/ssd-gpu-dma) to use NVMe storage directly with GPUs to bypass CPU and RAM, enabling up to **9613 MB/s write speeds** on Gen5, but practical applicability remains uncertain.
- **AdamW Optimizer State Allocation**: Identified a **32MB memleak** caused by allocating `cublaslt_workspace` twice, and discussions on consolidation of memory allocation for AdamW optimizer state. The debate centralizes around balancing efficient memory tracking and clean code structure.

- **Bitnet 1.58 gains interest for leading project**: A user offered to take the lead on the Bitnet 1.58 project, highlighting its significant improvements and sharing links to key resources: [1bitLLM's bitnet_b1_58-3B](https://huggingface.co/1bitLLM/bitnet_b1_58-3B) and a [demo](https://gist.github.com/CoffeeVampir3/c490286467fd5e1cc070d0a7a8cf3d6f).
- **Bitnet's unique approach to quantization explained**: The method involves training-aware quantization for linear layers, reducing the scake range of activations/weights, and then a post-training step that quantizes weights to (-1, 0, 1). Discussion pointed out the need for support infrastructure, such as 2-bit kernels and representations.
- **Training vs. Inference quantization benefits**: It was clarified that Bitnet does not show significant memory savings during training since full weights are still used. However, post-training quantization offers high compression potential, a fact supported by references like the [Bitnet 1.58 paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.17764) and [Microsoft's notes](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/blob/master/bitnet/The-Era-of-1-bit-LLMs__Training_Tips_Code_FAQ.pdf).
- **Potential efficiencies in training**: There was discussion about possibly leveraging rolling-training quantization for efficiency during training, although it's recognized as ambitious. The focus remains on developing a 2-bit quantization scheme for practical applications.
- **Centralize development in PyTorch's native library**: A suggestion was made to centralize work on implementing Bitnet in the [PyTorch ao repo](https://github.com/pytorch/ao) for better integration and support, including necessary operations like custom CUDA/Triton ops.

```html
- **Log samples with `--log_samples` feature**: *“--log_samples should store this information, in the per-sample log files we save model loglikelihoods per answer, and calculated per-sample metrics like accuracy.”* This clarifies that model log likelihoods and accuracy metrics are saved per sample when the `--log_samples` flag is used.

- **Prompting a Hugging Face model**: *“The model is automatically prompted with a default prompt based on current common practices.”* This means that default prompting is used for Hugging Face models unless otherwise specified.

- **ORPO technique yields lower scores**: *“Previously I fine-tuned the model with SFT method and with less sample data. However, the model showed a better score. And now I fine-tuned the model with ORPO technique and more data. But the model is showing a low score.”* This indicates a reverse performance issue when using ORPO technique with more data compared to SFT method with less data.

- **Searching for finance-related tasks**: A member inquired about good evaluation tasks specifically tailored for finance, trading, investing, and cryptocurrency domains. They emphasized that they are looking for such tasks in *English*.

```html
- **Conversion to Huggingface encounters issues**: A user highlighted problems converting a GPT-NeoX model to Huggingface using `/tools/ckpts/convert_neox_to_hf.py`, citing missing `word_embeddings.weight` and `attention.dense.weight`. They noted that even with the default 125M config, errors persist.
- **Naming conventions causing confusion**: The inconsistency in naming conventions when using Pipeline Parallelism (PP) was problematic. Specifically, PP=1 saves files in a different format than the conversion script expects, leading to errors.
- **Potential solution identified**: The user identified that files containing both naming conventions exist in the `PP>0` case, but fixing this in the conversion script only partially resolves the issue, as `key_error: word_embeddings.weight` persists.
- **MoE PR and script issues**: A change in `is_pipe_parallel` behavior in the MoE PR was noted as a possible source of issues. A fix for this and a tied-embedding handling bug was proposed in [PR #1218](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/pull/1218).
- **Recommendation and resolution**: The user was advised to switch to a supported configuration file, such as the Pythia config, given the misfit of their custom config with Huggingface's framework. It was also suggested to ensure compatible configs to avoid similar issues in the future.
