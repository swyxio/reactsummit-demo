- **Mixtral Sample Packing**: `@caseus_` has been working on implementing sample packing for Mixtral and has created a `mixtral-multipack` branch. There were reports of initial high loss that decreases, indicating the potential effectiveness of this approach. `@faldore` has been using the `mixtral-multipack` branch and reported stable operation and decreasing loss rates. 

- **Fixes and Workarounds**: Certain errors were encountered by users, for which workarounds and fixes were suggested. Specifically, disabling `is_mistral_derived_model: true` and changing `model_type: AutoTokenizerForCausalLM` seemed to resolve some issues. There was also a suggestion from `@casper_ai` to remove deepspeed if using a single GPU.

- **VRAM requirements**: Concerns regarding VRAM usage were discussed, with `@caseus_` suggesting strategies to reduce VRAM usage, such as freezing early layers of the model. Running Mixtral on 2xA6000 and 4xA100 GPUs was mentioned, with ambitions to achieve full finetuning on 4 to 8xA6000s. `@casper_ai` created a branch with parts of sharding to optimize VRAM usage, but it is still a work in progress. 

- **Model Error Reporting**: `@ludis___` reported a `RuntimeError` when running Mixtral which read "output tensor must have the same type as input tensor". This was resolved by the removal of certain configuration parameters. 

- **LoRA and qLoRA usage**: There were successful runs of Mixtral using qLoRA on GPU configurations such as 4xA100 and A40. However, attempts to run with LoRA resulted in errors related to the `bnb` package.

- **Merging Qlora Chat Mixtral Issue**: `@matts9903` reported an error received while attempting to merge the `mixtral` model with the Axolotl tool. The issue is with a validation error for `repo id`: ```huggingface_hub.utils._validators.HFValidationError: Repo id must use alphanumeric chars or '-', '_', '.', '--' and '..' are forbidden, '-' and '.' cannot start or end the name, max length is 96: './qlora-out'.```
    
- `@caseus_` suggested using an absolute path to the qlora-out directory but the suggestion didn’t resolve the issue. 

- `@caseus_` then shared a recent change to model merging [GitHub link](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl/commit/1d21aa6b0ac0e1de832b5d57c82da34220346046) and requested a stack trace for further troubleshooting.
