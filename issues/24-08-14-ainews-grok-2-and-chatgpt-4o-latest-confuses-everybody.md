> AI News for 8/13/2024-8/14/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**253** channels, and **2414** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **294 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

The easier development to discuss is the ratification of the new GPT-4o model that was [quietly released in ChatGPT](https://x.com/ChatGPTapp/status/1823109016223957387) last week. To be clear, this is DIFFERENT than the OTHER gpt-4o model released last week in API (the one [we covered with structured outputs](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-gpt4o-august-100-structured-outputs-for/)).

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/7d212faf-0f54-4be1-861a-150b0f32dbd3.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Approximately [nobody is exactly happy about this](https://x.com/teknium1/status/1823379952718565864?s=46) - from the new naming structure, to the [ever more creatively lowkey release](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/nathaniel-whittemore/episodes/A-New-OpenAI-Model-Coming-e2n4msp), and even to the [model performance](https://x.com/paulgauthier/status/1823715711254192611) - which is impressive - [reclaiming the #1 spot on Lmsys arena from Gemini 1.5 Pro August](https://x.com/lmsysorg/status/1823515224064098546).

New ChatGPT-4o Category Rankings:
- Overall: #1
- Math: #1-2
- Coding: #1
- Hard Prompts: #1
- Instruction-Following: #1
- Longer Query: #1
- Multi-Turn: #1

The much cleaner story to tell is X.ai's Grok 2, which released at [11pm PT last night](https://x.com/nearcyan/status/1823601166925889588), and is [revealed to be `sus-column-r`](https://x.com/jimmybajimmyba/status/1823600123487903883), which was NOT Cohere like many previously suspected. Grok 2 beats both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT 4o May and Mini:

While Grok 1 ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-grok-1-in-bio/))'s main feature was its open weights nature, Grok 2 is being released for premium subscribers in X, though [the blogpost](https://x.ai/blog/grok-2) teases that both Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini will be released in X's new Enterprise API platform "later this month".

Grok 2 in X also integrates **Black Forest Labs' comparatively uncensored Flux.1** ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-rombach-et-al-flux1-prodevschnell-31m-seed/)) model, which has already superceded Stable Diffusion 3 in [the open source text-to-image community](https://x.com/swyx/status/1823400729429868915) (while Google's Imagen 3 edges toward more open with [its new paper release](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07009)).

- **Mojo RPM Build: When can we get it?**: A member inquired about the ETA for a Mojo .rpm build, expressing a desire to run Mojo on RHEL machines without containerd.
   - Another member suggested that the Magic CLI is currently being treated as a solution for these issues, and that a statically linked build with a RHEL 8 minimum kernel might be a better option than an RPM, as it would allow for packaging on other distributions.
- **Conda's Rattler: Is it the right way to distribute Mojo?**: One member expressed concern about using Conda's Rattler to deliver Mojo, stating that they dislike needing additional tools to install a language.
   - They compared this approach to having to install a tool (`dnf install tool`) and then use that tool to install the language (`tool install language`), but acknowledged that it may be a suitable first step.
- **Tradeoffs of Distributing Mojo with Conda's Rattler**: Another member explained that the use of Conda's Rattler for Mojo distribution is a tradeoff due to the reliance on OS-provided versions of C, C++, and Python, which leads to security patch requests based on RHEL's support schedule.
   - They suggested that a Rustup/Conda-like tool in the repositories would be more suitable for developers, allowing them to install new versions of the compiler, while end-products could be packaged in the repositories for users.
- **Mojo Development Tooling: What's the ideal setup?**: Members discussed the ideal setup for Mojo development tooling, with the aim of providing a smooth experience for both developers and users.
   - One member proposed that Redhat packages the resulting programs, while leaving the development tools to the language ecosystem, suggesting that a global install of Magic with a custom configuration file should be the only requirement, allowing it to utilize a local cache for compilers and dependencies.
- **Magic CLI: Like Pixi, but for Mojo?**: One member expressed hope that the Magic CLI will function similarly to Pixi in terms of downloading dependencies, emphasizing their reliance on corporate cachers.
   - They envisioned a future where Magic operates like Rust's Cargo but also manages the language version, requiring only a global install of Magic, and expressed a preference for this approach over a shell-based method for pure Mojo projects.

> - `GraphRAG` 


- **Inconsistent OpenAI Responses**: A user is encountering inconsistent results from an OpenAI prompt, with the model sometimes providing a negative answer (referring to the helpdesk) even when it could have answered the question.
   - This is likely due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs, but the user is trying to improve the prompt's clarity to reduce this inconsistency.
- **Prompt Engineering for Consistency**: The user suggests changing the question to "Could you please provide me the complete list of commands in the document?" to improve clarity and reduce the number of incorrect responses.
   - This change successfully resulted in 100% accuracy, suggesting that providing a clear output format can significantly impact model performance.
- **LlamaIndex Agent and Tool Calls**: A user is trying to understand how to handle tool calls within a LlamaIndex Agent, specifically when using the `astream_chat()` function.
   - The discussion revolves around whether to send tool calls in the initial response or buffer them until the final response, with the consensus being that tool calls should be sent first in the `message.tool_calls` field of the LLM response.
- **Chatbot Memory using LlamaIndex**: A user is seeking guidance on building a RAG chatbot that can store conversations permanently in a vector database, enabling it to remember past interactions.
   - They are looking for examples of open source projects or methods to implement this functionality within LlamaIndex, exploring the possibility of extending the chatbot's memory beyond the current chat history buffer.
- **Extracting Image Content from PDFs**: A user is looking for an open-source solution to extract image content from PDFs for use in RAG, specifically to add image captions to the end of page content.
   - They have explored tools like `ImageVisionLLMReader` and `LlamaParse` but are struggling to find a suitable method, particularly one that can be hosted locally and doesn't require sending data to a third-party service.

> - `Image Feature Extraction`
> - `Preprocessing Time Reduction` 


- **Simple Feature Store Speeds Up Training**: A user built a simple feature store for their R&D team, enabling them to store extracted features from images during online preprocessing.
   - This has significantly reduced training time, saving between 30-60 minutes per training run.
- **Generic Feature Store for Diverse Models**: The feature store is generic, accommodating image IDs, extraction methods, and pointers to extracted features in an object store.
   - It successfully handles diverse models, from extremely small to absolutely massive ones, allowing for efficient feature storage and retrieval.
- **Feature Extraction from Images**: A user inquired about the types of features being extracted from images.
   - The user providing the information indicated they cannot disclose the specifics due to non-disclosure agreements.

> - `Agentic AI Pipelines`
> - `Jupyter Notebook Automation`
> - `Devin-like System` 


- **Building an Agentic Jupyter Notebook Automation System**: A member asked about existing libraries, cookbooks, or open-source projects that could help build an agentic system to automate Jupyter Notebooks, specifically for swapping cells and generating variations.
   - The goal is to create a pipeline that can validate outputs and iteratively improve until successful, similar to the Devin project but focused on a specific, small task.
- **The Power of Automated Jupyter Notebook Modification**: The proposed system would take a working Jupyter Notebook as input and modify it by swapping out cells, ultimately generating multiple versions.
   - This automated process would allow for efficient exploration of different notebook configurations and potentially lead to improved results.
