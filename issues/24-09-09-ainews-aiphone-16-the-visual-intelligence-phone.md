<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Apple Intelligence is maybe all you need.**

> AI News for 9/6/2024-9/9/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**215** channels, and **7493** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **774 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

At the special [Apple Event today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uarNiSl_uh4), the new iPhone 16 lineup was announced, together with [5 minutes](https://x.com/swyx/status/1832234771973583220) spent covering some updates on Apple Intelligence (we'll assume you are up to speed on our [WWDC](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-talaria-apples-new-mlops-superweapon-4066/) and [Beta release](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-apple-intelligence/) coverage).

The newest update is what they now call **Visual Intelligence**, rolling out with the new dedicated Camera Control button for iPhone 16:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/3d0c61de-f2d7-4b79-925f-6e848d2eb964.png?w=960&fit=max) 

As discussed on the [Winds of AI Winter pod](https://x.com/latentspacepod/status/1819394111352590802) and now confirmed, Apple is commoditizing OpenAI and putting its own services first:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6fadfdf0-da63-4ae9-a2ee-d10670e369cf.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Presumably one will eventually be able to configure what the Ask and Search buttons call in the new UI, but every Visual Intelligence request will run through Apple Maps and Siri first and those services second. Apple wins here by running first, being default, and being private/free, which is surprisingly a more defensible position than being "best".

Apple Photos now also have very good video understanding, down to the timestamps in a video:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/e575859c-9290-4a9b-91a3-4d7a1c97f948.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Craig Federighi called this a part of Apple Intelligence in his segment, but some of these features are already [in the iOS 18.0 beta](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41493502) (Apple Intelligence only shipped in iOS 18.1).

You can read [the Hacker News commentary](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41493023) for other highlights and cynical takes but that's the big must-know thing from today.

How many years until Apple Visual Intelligence is just... always on?

**A Note on Reflection 70B**: our [coverage last week](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-reflection-70b-by-matt-from-it-department/) (and [tweet op-ed](https://x.com/swyx/status/1832234771973583220)) covered known criticisms on Friday, but more emerged over the weekend to challenge their claims. We expect more developments over the course of this week, therefore it is premature to make it another title story, but interested readers should scroll to the /r/localLlama section below for a full accounting. 

Perhaps we should [work on more ungameable LLM evals](https://x.com/drjimfan/status/1833160432833716715?s=46)? Good thing this month's inference is supported by our friends at W&B...

> - `Vertex AI Key Compatibility`
> - `JSON Formatting Issues`
> - `Google AI Studio Usage`
> - `Base64 Encoding Workaround` 


- **Vertex AI Key requires full JSON**: A member noted that for the Vertex AI key, it indeed needs to be the whole **JSON** object, including the **project_id** and other details.
   - This point was confirmed after some discussion about whether just the **private_key** would suffice.
- **Google AI Studio is current requirement**: Members discussed limitations in using Vertex AI, confirming that as of now, one can only use **Google AI Studio**.
   - This indicates that further fixes are necessary to expand compatibility options.
- **Base64 encoding suggested as solution**: A clever workaround was suggested for upload issues with the JSON file: convert the whole JSON to **Base64** and decode it before sending to Vertex AI.
   - This method was mentioned as a *stolen idea* from a [GitHub PR discussion](https://github.com/saoudrizwan/claude-dev/pull/45#issuecomment-2293115878).

- **Discussion on Power Law Curves**: Members discussed why **power law curves** seem effective for modeling **performance scaling** in ML, including theories and frameworks. They referenced specific statistical models that relate to the scaling laws observed in statistical estimation tasks.
   - A member suggested that *scaling laws for LLM loss* are similar to those in statistical estimation, noting that mean squared error in estimating means scales as **N^(-1/2)**.
- **Self-Organized Criticality Explained**: The concept of **self-organized criticality** was introduced, asserting that many systems converge on a critical point exhibiting **power-law fluctuations**. This phenomenon is important for understanding the behavior of **critical systems** in various fields.
   - One member highlighted that this concept originated with Per Bak, providing a link to Bak's [evolution model](https://www.jasss.org/4/4/reviews/bak.html) demonstrating the theory.
- **Sandpile Model Demonstrates Criticality**: A historical reference was made to an experiment by Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld studying **avalanches** in a sandpile model. They observed that the size distribution of avalanches followed a **power law** when the slope reached a critical angle, leading to convergence at that angle.
   - It's important to clarify that the experiment was a mathematical model rather than a physical setup, aiming to capture the dynamics of critical points.
- **Skepticism Surrounding Power Law Evidence**: Concerns were raised regarding the validity of claims about **power law scaling**, noting many simpler explanations might exist. Additionally, instances of only demonstrating a few orders of magnitude in **log-log plots** were pointed out as weak evidence for universal power laws.
   - Members agreed that **more orders of magnitude** in scaling are necessary to convincingly demonstrate that a universal power law is in effect.
