   - Members expressed opinions on whether this change could lead to unexpected behaviors with existing workflows.
- **Alpaca Training Parameter Discrepancy**: Concerns were raised regarding the default setting of **train_on_input** in the Alpaca training library, with a current default of **False** being questioned if it's appropriate based on common practices.
   - Members discussed various repositories like Hugging Face's **trl** and Stanford Alpaca to clarify these defaults and potential issues.
- **European Access to the Platform**: A query arose about whether users in **Europe** can utilize the platform, leading to confirmations that it is accessible, including in non-UK locations.
   - One member noted a successful access in **London**, while another humorously pointed out previous exits from the EU to explain the current situation.
