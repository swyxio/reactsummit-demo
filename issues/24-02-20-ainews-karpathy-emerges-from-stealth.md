description: >-
  **Andrej Karpathy** released a comprehensive 2-hour tutorial on
  **tokenization**, detailing techniques up to **GPT-4**'s tokenizer and noting
  the complexity of **Llama 2** tokenization with SentencePiece. Discussions in
  AI Discord communities covered **model optimization and efficiency**, focusing
  on **quantization** of models like **Mistral 7B** and **Zephyr-7B** to reduce
  memory usage for consumer GPUs, including Intel's new weight-only quantization
  algorithm. Efforts to improve computational efficiency included selective
  augmentation reducing costs by 57.76% and memory token usage versus kNN for
  Transformers. Challenges in hardware compatibility and software issues were
  shared, alongside fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA and model merging.
  Innovative applications of LLMs in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
  multi-model learning, and meta-reasoning were explored. The community
  emphasized dataset sharing, open-source releases like SDXL VAE encoded
  datasets and Audiogen AI codecs, and ethical AI use with censorship and
  guardrails. Collaboration and resource sharing remain strong in these AI
  communities.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI Discords for 2/19/2024. We checked **20** guilds, **313** channels, and **3952** messages for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **346 minutes**.

As mentioned in yesterday's recap, Andrej shipped [his Tokenization tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE) with accompanying [github repo](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe) ([tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1759996549109776702)):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE

It is sobering how this 2hr tutorial is necessary to fully understand tokenization up to the RegEx patterns used in GPT4's tokenizer, but, as Andrej notes, even then it is far from complete to get up to Llama 2 tokenization with SentencePiece, and yet tokenization was at the core of many LLM failure modes at least from GPT2-GPT4.

- **Seeking Clarity on Roleplay and Function-Calling**: User `@gman5723` inquired about a model adept at both roleplay and function calling. `@mrdragonfox` clarified that **function calling essentially involves JSON formatting** and requires manual execution.

- **Dataset Woes and Words of Support**: `@ikaridev` [shared a link to a dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MinervaAI/Aesir-Preview) marked for sensitive content, then later mentioned **the unfortunate leak of their datasets** to `@c.gato`, evoking sympathy and support from the community.

- **Concern Over Deterministic Model Responses**: `@_dampf` observed that the `bagelmisterytour` model tends to repeat phrases, especially at the start, even when changing sampler settings. `@ycros` acknowledged this might be **related to sampler settings or long contexts influencing determinism**.

- **The Challenge of Using Deep Learning Models**: Discussion about using deep learning models included challenges like managing batch sizes, as `@kaltcit` noted a constraint to **batch size 1 with 10420 sequence length** and the problematic nature of a loss registering as 0.0.

- **Learning Rate Recommendations for DPO**: Amidst insights on **Deep Partial Optimization (DPO)**, `@c.gato` suggested much lower learning rates could be necessary, potentially in connection with **LoRA adapters** and double merges as a non-optimal but practiced method.

- **Tackling Censorship in Chat Models**:
`@octopus_` raised a question about how to implement censorship for a model, specifically avoiding discussing pricing without context. The strategy should be akin to how ChatGPT manages adult content censorship.

- **Strategies for Implementing Chat Model Guardrails**:
`@maldevide` suggested using a discriminator model to serve as a guardrail or fine-tuning the model according to the desired responses. Further, `@maldevide` proposed prompt tuning, which uses a specific token sequence to guide the model to the intended latent space.

- **Challenges with Discriminator Models**: 
`@octopus_` tried using a discriminator model for censorship but encountered many false positives. `@maldevide` advised increasing the examples in the n-shot to reduce false positives and adding a chain of thought workflow for better reasoning.

- **Insights on Model Censorship and Guardrails**:
`@jeremy.london` referenced a relevant paper and the NVIDIA NeMo-Guardrails project that discusses censorship and guardrails in models. This approach involves confirming whether generated content meets specific rules and then logging and flagging non-compliant outputs.

- **Guardrail Complexity and the Need for Reinforcement Learning**:
`@jeremy.london` noted that reinforcement learning is needed to refine guardrails for practical use, and shared a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/70tZ43aa5J4?si=s5LBw-QLCiqXa_nm) on the leaked GPT-4 system prompt. Despite efforts, there's always a gap in model censorship which usually begins with the dataset.

- **Debunking LLM's Acting Skills**: `@i_am_dom` clarifies a common misconception about LLMs, explaining that their behavior is shaped during the fine-tuning stage to act as AI assistants. The fact that you can make an LLM "act any way you want" at this stage was emphasized to indicate the ability to shape its responses.
- **Mistral-next versus Llama Performance Inquiry**: Users `@jamshed1900`, `@mrdragonfox`, and `@drnicefellow` discuss the performance of Mistral-next. Although performance comparisons are limited, there's a consensus that Mistral-next shows better reasoning than its predecessors.
- **Finetuning Finesse Request**: `@timuryun` seeks assistance with finetuning, getting directed to someone experienced - `<@266127174426165249>`, by `@drnicefellow`.
- **Open Source or Not?**: Questions about whether models like Mistral-next are open source and available for download arose in conversation with `@timuryun`, `@drnicefellow`, and `@mrdragonfox`. It was clarified that Mistral-next is currently a prototype test on lmsys and not openly available.
- **Discussing AI Model Capabilities and Investments**: A discourse led by `@i_am_dom`, `@mrdragonfox`, and others suggests that the infrastructure, funding, and expertise behind Mistral are comparable to those at OpenAI, though decisions on training much larger models like a 100B from scratch are still under wraps.

- **Experimenting with Multi-Model Approaches**: `@mehdi_guel` plans to experiment by combining *in-context learning* with *chain-of-thought* in a multi-model approach and will update the group on the results.

- **Expert Extraction Enigma**: `@redbrain` inquired about extracting individual experts from **Mixtral** for use as standalone dense **Mistral 7b models** for experimental purposes, recognizing the impracticality but expressing interest in the conceptual possibility.

- **Understanding MoE's Nature**: Multiple posts by `@mrdragonfox` clarified that a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model like **Mixtral** cannot have its experts extracted as standalone models because the expertise is not isolated; it's distributed across the model, and the routing happens at the token level.

- **Deconstructing MoE Could Be Futile**: In response to `@redbrain`'s continued interest, `@mrdragonfox` explained that attempting to deconstruct **Mixtral** would likely not produce coherent outputs, and emphasized that even if the process is feasible, the result wouldn't surpass a standard **7b Instruct 0.2 model**.

- **Performance Puzzle with GPU vs. CPU**: `@mikifireblue` observed a slow token generation rate when using a GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1660 TI) compared to using only CPU, while testing with the model "mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf" and llama-cpp, leading `@ginterhauser` to suggest trying an AWQ format as it is better suited for CPU usage.

- **RAG Customization vs. Service**: `@skiboyec` queried about the advantages of building a custom RAG system over using a RAG-as-a-service provider, questioning if a custom system can offer better retrieval performance without concerns for self-hosting, scalability, or API costs.
- **Purpose Defines Building or Subscribing**: `@desk_and_chair` responded speculating that the decision might depend on the goal—whether to leverage RAG for personal use or to offer RAG as a service to others. They likened the situation to preferring a good burger without necessarily wanting to grill it themselves.
