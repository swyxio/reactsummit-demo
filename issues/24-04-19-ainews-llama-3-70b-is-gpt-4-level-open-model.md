<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 4/18/2024-4/19/2024. We checked 6 subreddits and [**364** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **27** Discords (**395** channels, and **10403** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **958 minutes**.

With a sample size of 1600 votes, the early results from Lmsys were even better than reported benchmarks suggested, which is rare these days:

This is the first open model to beat Opus, which itself was the first model to briefly beat GPT4 Turbo. Of course this may drift over time, but things bode very well for Llama-3-400b when it drops.

Already [Groq is serving the 70b model at 500-800 tok/s](https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1781355430914015482), which makes Llama 3 the hands down fastest GPT-4-level token source period.

With recent replication [results on Chinchilla](https://twitter.com/tamaybes/status/1780639257389904013) coming under some scrutiny (don't miss [Susan Zhang banger](https://twitter.com/suchenzang/status/1616752482226671620?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ainews-to-be-named-5820), acknowledged by [Chinchilla coauthor](https://twitter.com/borgeaud_s/status/1780988694163321250?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ainews-to-be-named-5820)), Llama 2 and 3 (and Mistral, to a less open extent) have pretty conclusively consigned Chinchilla laws to the dustbin of history.

- **Exploring Group-Size Implications for GPTQ and int4wo**: A discussion unfolded regarding how GPTQ and int4wo handle non-divisible group sizes in matrix operations. With GPTQ effectively treating dimensions as if they were divisible by group sizes, excess is ignored, while int4wo requires padding for non-divisible dimensions.

- **Jeff Johnson on tinygemm Row Wise Grouping**: Jeff Johnson, the writer of tinygemm, explains that tinygemm uses row-wise grouping due to all presented matrices having the reduction dimension as the innermost, which is common across grouped quantization schemes. However, an alternate method using axis=1 was found slower due to increased zero/scale access.

- **Quantization and Concatenation Concerns for Model Weights**: The compatibility of axis=0 grouping in tinygemm with QKV weight concatenation was questioned, as quantizing the combined weight would potentially mix channels of weight matrices.

- **CUDA Dequant Kernels Update**: The discussion mentioned the optimization of CUDA dequant kernels for 4-bit operations, which could be especially beneficial for training quantized models on GPUs with limited capability.

- **Integrating HQQ into torchao**: There was a dialogue about potentially integrating Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ) into torchao, addressing concerns about dependencies and suggesting alternatives like copying relevant code. The concept of a unique 4-bit quantization kernel, which utilizes lookup tables instead of scale and zero_point, was proposed and debated for efficiency and practicality in implementation.

- **CUDA Profiling and Optimization Discussions**: Members have been optimizing CUDA code for GPU efficiency using **NVIDIA Nsight Compute**. After much refinement, including loop reorganizations and eliminating redundant calculations, a significant speedup was achieved, bringing the [CUDA model training loop](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/179/files) down from 960ms to 250ms on an A4000 GPU, and to 77ms for a full training iteration, surpassing PyTorch's timing.

- **CUDA vs. PyTorch Performance**: They discovered that after [further optimizations](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/179/files) and integration of the fused classifier kernel, performance exceeded PyTorch's metrics in certain tests, making PyTorch now the new target to beat.

- **Fused Classifier Improvements**: Implementing a non `float4` version of the classifier kernel in CUDA reduced the number of expensive CUDA calls, while the removal of manual softmax computation gained additional speedup despite being initially slower than the `float4` version.

- **Efficiency in CUDA Kernels**: Discussions highlight how integer divisions can be a significant performance hit in CUDA kernels. By passing pre-computed values from the CPU side, they achieved a 25% reduction in instructions and a 1% speedup of the kernel, despite overall time being constrained by waiting on data.

- **Multi-GPU Considerations**: Conversations touched on potential approaches to multi-GPU training, preferring data parallelism (DDP) over model parallelism, starting with a single allReduce call for within-node GPU communication and possibly progressing to libraries like MPI or NCCL.

**Modular (Mojo 🔥) ▷ #[🔥mojo](https://discord.com/channels/1087530497313357884/1151418092052815884/1230469271365091378)** (118 messages🔥🔥): 

- **Exploring Runtime Garbage Collection Discussions**: The conversation revolved around the Nim language's cycle collector with ref counting in version 2.0, which runs at runtime. One user proposed the possibility of Modular's Mojo language integrating something similar, suggesting that Mojo sometimes just moves references, but other members expressed concerns about the complexity and potential performance implications.

- **Mojo's Language Capabilities and Feature Speculations**: Users discussed the extent to which Mojo supports various functionalities. There was talk of Mojo possibly supporting shell commands through C external calls, confusion over printing tuples since they lack a "Stringable" trait, and curiosity about whether Mojo will include first-class test support akin to Zig.

- **Pondering First-Class Test Support and Decorators**: A key topic was the potential for incorporating first-class testing in Mojo, similar to Zig's testing approach. There was also a mention of preferring an `@test` decorator for tests to be a dead code when not testing, similar to Rust's `#[cfg(test)]`. 

- **Wishing for Pytest-Like Assertions**: One member expressed a wish for assertions in Mojo to be more like Pytest, using the built-in assert keyword. This sparked a discussion about the differences between tests and assertions and the significance of having a test suite.

- **Package Management and Community Contributions**: There was excitement about community involvement in Mojo's growth and the possibility of a packaging and build system. Modular's intent to develop tools like `mojo test` and to lay foundations for a packaging system spurred on discussion about allowing the community to build test frameworks and other packages.
