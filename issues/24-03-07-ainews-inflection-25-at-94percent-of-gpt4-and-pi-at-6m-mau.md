- **Harnessing Desired Output Formats**: `@pminervini` inquired about how to customize model outputs to a specified format using the [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). `@baber_` advised on modifying the `generate_until` method and utilizing `_loglikelihood_tokens` preceded by conditionally making the generate call based on calculated log_probs.

- **MCQA Eval/Artifacts Paper Shared by Creator**: `@nish5989` shared [their recent paper](https://twitter.com/NishantBalepur/status/1764729478893174977) focused on multiple-choice questions evaluation and dataset artifacts. A discussion ensued regarding the impact of following or ignoring irrelevant instructions in model prompts, with `@hailey_schoelkopf` referencing related works on how models react to prompts.

- **Consistency in Fine-Tuning**: `@karatsubabutslower` questioned the lack of a standardized approach for fine-tuning models on benchmarks like the GLUE dataset. The lm-evaluation-harness provides a standardized evaluation method, but there does not seem to be a similar framework for the fine-tuning process.

- **Evaluating with Generation vs. Loglikelihood**: `@hailey_schoelkopf` expressed interest in how often models fail to produce answers in the correct format, using generation methods rather than loglikelihood. `@nish5989` responded that, as noted in their paper's appendix, validity typically wasn't an issue, especially in stricter settings, with considerations for future experiments using likelihood methods.

- **Discussion on Multilingual Evaluation Criteria**: `@seanbethard` queried the preference for language-specific evaluation criteria over crosslingual ones in language understanding and reasoning. They questioned the efficacy and necessity of language-specific eval criteria, especially if it precludes non-native speakers from creating it.

- **Optimizer Memory Peaks Under Scrutiny**: `@tastybucketofrice` raised an issue regarding memory peaks during the optimizer step, pointing to [GitHub issue #1160](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/issues/1160) and PyTorch memory profiling for more context. `@gaindrew` requested specific configuration details to faithfully reproduce the problem for further analysis.

- **A Night of Dependency Conflicts**: `@biiter` mentioned facing multiple challenges, including incompatible PyTorch version dependencies and a crashing machine due to parallel compilation. They succeeded in running the setup on Ubuntu 22.04 with Cuda 12.3 after a series of workarounds, including installing apex from the NVIDIA git repository and capping parallel compilation ([flash-attention info](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-features)).

- **Docker Image, a Solution to Dependency Hell?**: `@tastybucketofrice` suggested using their newly rebased docker container around pytorch NGC to alleviate recent issues with dependencies like apex ([GitHub commit #1170](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/commit/119950c7faee46e7929baac8640c84aa9fda4d2b)). `@tfidia` recommended docker + enroot for a lightweight installation alternative, mentioning its support by the Slurm plugin pyxis for containerized job launches.

- **Poetry for Dependency Management**: `@catboy_slim_` proposed moving dependencies into poetry for more deterministic package management, discussing both the challenges and aspirations for a stable source installation outside of Docker. They stressed the need for a source build that mirrors the reliability of a docker environment.

- **Challenges with Fused Backward/Optimizer Implementations**: `@gaindrew` describes progress on a fused backward/optimizer implementation that has led to a significant reduction in peak memory usage at the expense of breaking certain DeepSpeed and logging functionalities. Further work is set to address these issues and is specifically aimed at Adam optimizers.

- **Debugging Template Crashes**: `@trufuswashington` sought advice from the expert (`@746595581086138409`) due to issues with creating templates for common use cases; one template worked fine, while another kept crashing the `llm` command.
- **Error Output Shared**: They shared the error output, showing that the `llm` command failed due to a `TypeError` related to "expected str instance, NoneType found" during variable interpolation.
- **Working vs. Crashing Templates Compared**: `@trufuswashington` attached two YAML templates for comparison. The working one was for modifying text blocks and the faulty one was for providing brief explanations on various types of code-related content.
- **Cause of the Crash Found**: Eventually, `@trufuswashington` discovered the cause of the crash—it was due to the presence of a dollar sign `$` in the template prompt where it was not expected.
- **Dollar Sign Culprit**: Specifically, the error was triggered by the line "I will tip you $100 if you do this." in the crashing template, indicating issues with handling the special character in the prompt interpolation.
