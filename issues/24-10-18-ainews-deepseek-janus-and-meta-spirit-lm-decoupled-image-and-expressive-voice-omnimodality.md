  **DeepSeek Janus** and **Meta SpiRit-LM** are two notable multimodality AI
  models recently released, showcasing advances in image generation and speech
  synthesis respectively. DeepSeek Janus separates vision encoders for image
  understanding and generation, achieving better results in both tasks. Meta's
  SpiRit-LM introduces an expressive speech and writing model generating pitch
  and style units, improving over standard TTS. Additionally, **W&B Weave**
  offers comprehensive LLM observability and multimodality fine-tuning tools.
  Industry updates include Nvidia's Nemotron 70b model underperforming, Meta
  open-sourcing Movie Gen Bench for media generation benchmarking, Perplexity
  launching internal search with multi-step reasoning, and Anthropic updating
  Claude apps. Open source progress includes Hugging Face's gradient
  accumulation fix in transformers and advocacy for open source AI to prevent
  Big Tech dominance. *"Model merging for combining skills of multiple models"*
  is also highlighted.

Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **249 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

It is multimodality day in AI research land as two notable multimodality papers were released: [Janus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13848) and [SpiRit-LM](https://speechbot.github.io/spiritlm/).

## DeepSeek Janus

Earlier work like Chameleon ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-chameleon-metas-unreleased-gpt4o-like/)) and [Show-O](https://x.com/swyx/status/1827099985944703408) used a single vision encoder for both visual understanding (image input) and generation (image output). Deepseek separated them:

and found better results in comparable size image generation:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/36a410ea-f4b4-45a7-8d02-7a2cf44094c3.png?w=960&fit=max)

and image understanding:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/83283b56-cb48-4221-b6a7-edbc47b1ef21.png?w=960&fit=max)

Open question as to whether this approach maintains its advantage with scale, and if it is really all that important to include image generation in the same stack.

## Meta SpiRit-LM

Along with [SAM 2.1 and Layer Skip](https://ai.meta.com/blog/fair-news-segment-anything-2-1-meta-spirit-lm-layer-skip-salsa-lingua/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_content=thread&utm_campaign=fair), Meta's Friday drop included [SpiRit-LM](https://speechbot.github.io/spiritlm/), a (Spi)eech and W(Rit)ing model that also includes an "expressive" version generating pitch and style units.

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/04271f45-146a-4aac-82eb-2ef24788ee30.png?w=960&fit=max)

[The demo](https://speechbot.github.io/spiritlm/) has voice samples - not quite NotebookLM level, but you can see how this is a step above standard TTS.
