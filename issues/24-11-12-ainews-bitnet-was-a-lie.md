<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Scaling Laws for Precision (Quantization) are all you need.**

> AI News for 11/11/2024-11/12/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**217** channels, and **2286** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **281 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

In a growing literature of [post-Chinchilla papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00448), the enthusiasm for quantization reached its zenith this summer with the BitNet paper ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-the-era-of-1-bit-llms/)) proposing as severe a quantization schema as ternary (-1, 0, 1) aka 1.58 bits. A group of grad students under Chris Re has [now modified Chinchilla scaling laws for quantization](https://x.com/Tanishq97836660/status/1856045600355352753) over 465+ pretraining runs and found that the benefits level off at FP6.

Lead author [Tanishq Kumar](https://x.com/Tanishq97836660/status/1856045604188893492) notes:

- **the longer you train/the more data seen during pretraining, the more sensitive the model becomes to quantization at inference-time**, explaining why Llama-3 may be harder to quantize. 
- In fact, this loss degradation is roughly **a power law in the token/parameter ratio seen during pretraining**, so that you can predict in advance the critical data size beyond which pretraining on more data is actively harmful if you're serving a quantized model. 
- The intuition might be that **as more knowledge is compressed into weights as you train on more data, a given perturbation will damage performance more.**
 
Below is a fixed language model overtrained significantly to various data budgets up to 30B tokens, then post-train quantized afterwards. This demonstrates how more pretraining FLOPs do not always lead to better models served in production.

[QLoRA author Tim Dettmers notes the end of the quantized scaling "free lunch" even more starkly](https://x.com/Tim_Dettmers/status/1856338240099221674): "Arguably, most progress in AI came from improvements in computational capabilities, which mainly relied on low-precision for acceleration (32-> 16 -> 8 bit). This is now coming to an end. Together with physical limitations, **this creates the perfect storm for the end of scale.** From my own experience (a lot of failed research), you cannot cheat efficiency. **If quantization fails, then also sparsification fails, and other efficiency mechanisms too. If this is true, we are close to optimal now.** With this, there are only [three ways forward](https://x.com/Tim_Dettmers/status/1856338252120068523) that I see... All of this means that **the paradigm will soon shift from scaling to "what can we do with what we have"**. I think the paradigm of "how do we help people be more productive with AI" is the best mindset forward.

- **[LLMs distributed across 4 M4 Pro Mac Minis + Thunderbolt 5 interconnect (80Gbps).](https://x.com/alexocheema/status/1855238474917441972)** ([Score: 58, Comments: 30](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gowx3o/llms_distributed_across_4_m4_pro_mac_minis/)): **Running Qwen 2.5** on a setup of **four M4 Pro Mac Minis** interconnected via **Thunderbolt 5** with a bandwidth of **80Gbps** is discussed. The focus is on the potential for distributing **LLMs** across this hardware configuration.
  - Discussion centers on the cost-effectiveness and configuration of **M4 Pro Mac Minis** compared to alternatives like the **M2 Ultra** and **M4 Max**. A fully kitted M4 Pro Mini costs around **$2,100**, with a setup of two providing **128GB of VRAM** compared to the **$4,999 M4 Max**, though the latter offers double the memory bandwidth and GPU cores.
  - Users debate the practicality of **Mac Minis** versus traditional setups like a **ROMED8-2T motherboard with 4x3090 GPUs**, citing the former's ease of use and reduced heat output. The potential to avoid common issues with **Linux, CUDA errors**, and **PCIe** is highlighted as a significant advantage.
  - There is skepticism about performance claims, with questions about model specifics such as whether it is **tensor parallel** or the type of model precision used (e.g., **fp16, Q2**). The need for proof of the **Mac Mini's** capabilities in fine-tuning at reasonable speeds is emphasized before considering a switch from existing rigs.

> - `SCAR`
> - `NVIDIA paper on frequency noise`
> - `Sparse Autoencoders`
> - `Code generation models`

- **Introducing GitChameleon for Code Generation Models**: The new dataset \\textbf{\\GitChameleon{ }} introduces **116 Python code completion problems** conditioned on specific library versions, with executable unit tests to rigorously assess LLMs' capabilities.
  
  - This aims to address the limitations of existing benchmarks that ignore the dynamic nature of software library evolution and does not evaluate practical usability.
- **Exciting Launch of SCAR for Concept Detection**: SCAR, a method for precise concept detection and steering in LLMs, learns **monosemantic features** using Sparse Autoencoders in a supervised manner.
  
  - It offers strong detection for concepts like **toxicity, safety, and writing style** and is available for experimentation in Hugging Face's transformers.
- **NVIDIA's Paper on Noise Frequency Training**: The NVIDIA paper presents a concept where **higher spatial frequencies** are noised faster than lower frequencies during the forward noising step.
  
  - In the backwards denoising step, the model is trained explicitly to work from **low to high frequencies**, providing a unique approach to training.
- **Discussion on the Clarity of NVIDIA Paper**: A member noted that the explanations in the NVIDIA paper are **hard to follow**, but they grasped the basic idea of the noise training method.
  
  - Despite being **disorganized**, the concept presented in the paper is considered interesting and worth exploring.
