date: '2024-01-25T21:30:23.929279Z'
original_slug: ainews-adept-fuyu-heavy-multimodal-model-for
description: >-
  **Adept** launched **Fuyu-Heavy**, a multimodal model focused on UI
  understanding and visual QA, outperforming **Gemini Pro** on the MMMU
  benchmark. The model uses **DPO** (Direct Preference Optimization), gaining
  attention as a leading tuning method. The size of Fuyu-Heavy is undisclosed
  but estimated between **20B-170B** parameters, smaller than rumored frontier
  models like **Claude 2**, **GPT4V**, and **Gemini Ultra**. Meanwhile,
  **Mamba** was rejected at ICLR for quality concerns. In Discord discussions,
  **DeepSeek Coder 33B** was claimed to outperform **GPT-4** in coding tasks,
  and deployment strategies for large models like **Yi-34B-200K** and
  **Goliath-120B** were explored. Quantization debates highlighted mixed views
  on **Q8** and **EXL2 quants**. Fine-tuning and instruct-tuning of **Mistral 7B
  Instruct v0.2** were discussed, alongside insights on RMS optimization and
  heterogeneous AI architectures combining **Transformers** and **Selective SSM
  (Mamba)**. The potential of recurrent LLMs like **RWKV** and techniques like
  **Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO)** were also noted.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI Discords for 1/24/2024. We checked **20** guilds, **297** channels, and **3025** messages for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **295 minutes**.

Adept's turn for a [splashy launch](https://www.adept.ai/blog/adept-fuyu-heavy):

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/db04109d-dc48-4921-bc96-012766913818.png?w=960&fit=max) 

The emphasis seems to be UI understanding, which given Adept's business makes sense as a focus. [The demo video](https://vimeo.com/906055649) shows very good and precise visual QA on 7 screenshots of UIs, but revealed no other part of the Adept product because it was on a gradio interface. Fuyu also  uses DPO, which has suddenly become the presumptive winner of the brief [DPO vs IPO vs KTO wars](https://huggingface.co/blog/pref-tuning). Fuyu-Heavy beats Gemini Pro on the new MMMU benchmark, but it's unclear where GPT4V registers on this (someone run it?)

A couple people [called out](https://twitter.com/teortaxestex/status/1750353889499459746) the side comments on the size of Fuyu-Heavy vs Claude 2 and GPT4-V and Gemini Ultra given those details aren't public, and Adept itself didn't actually even mention their own model size (it's bigger than [Fuyu-8B](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b), that's all we really know). Assuming those frontier models are in the rumored [400B](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iQx2eeHKLwgBYdWPZ/retrospective-on-gpt-4-predictions-after-the-release-of-gpt) to [1.7T](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1671272883379908608?lang=en) param range, being 10-20x smaller puts **Fuyu-Heavy around the 20B-170B lower-upper bounds**.

**In other news**, Mamba was [rejected for ICLR as "not good enough"](https://twitter.com/srush_nlp/status/1750526956452577486). Lol?

They noted that adding explanations and descriptive scores did little to improve the system's discriminative power.
- **Tackling Model Bias and Rating Challenges**: `@calytrix` observed very strong preferences in the numbers the model assigns, suggesting that fine-tuning could mitigate these biases. They emphasized the complexity of the tasks and suggested developing a specific evaluation and scoring system tailored to the model's capabilities.
- **Complexity in Assessment Recognized**: The task of rating importance is particularly difficult for GPT-3.5 due to the **implied complexity** `@calytrix` mentioned, something humans find easy.
- **Rating System Recommendations**: `@calytrix` recommended breaking down complex questions, like assessing importance, into more specific ratings that GPT-3.5 can handle more effectively. They also suggested a simplified rating system with limited options, such as **"poor, mixed, good, very good"**.

- **Gauging Data Quality for Language Model Fine-Tuning**: User `@thewindmom` questioned how to evaluate data quality when fine-tuning language models, emphasizing the avoidance of poor input data. `@hammadkhan` suggested techniques like **eye-balling, deduplication, and heuristic-based filtering** for maintaining data quality.

- **DIY Synthetics Reduce the Need for Evaluation**: In response to `@thewindmom`, `@bjoernp` proposed that creating your own synthetic data can lower the need for external evaluation, hinting at the use of **built-in guides** and **information-rich** models to produce such data.

- **Discussing Synthetic Data Generation for Fine-Tuning**: `@thewindmom` asked about the use of synthetic data, particularly referencing **NeMo Guardrails**, to which `@bjoernp` mentioned the proactive creation of synthetic data with guardrails that a strong model can utilize effectively for training.

- **Sharing Resources on Synthetic Data and Self-Instruct Methods**: `@_jp1_` shared that DiscoResearch is still refining their synthetic data generation process and highlighted **jon durbins' Airoboros repo** as a key reference, while discussing customized implementations for the self-instruct paper. They provided a [GitHub link to Airoboros](https://github.com/jondurbin/airoboros) for further insights and inspirations.

- **Training Dilemmas: Using Instruction+Answer Pairs**: In a discussion led by `@philipmay`, the query raised concerns about using **instruction+answer pairs**. They inquired if something useful could be done with just pairs of instruction and bad answer for model training, given the absence of a good answer to create **triplets** for DPO or other training efforts.
