- **Deep Dive into GPU Selection for Deep Learning**: `@thewindmom` shared a comprehensive [GPU guide](https://timdettmers.com/2023/01/30/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/) for selecting the best GPU for deep learning tasks. They provided a comparison of GPUs by speed for llama inference, noting **NVIDIA's 4090 is faster than both 3090 and Mac Studio M2 Ultra**, and also shared a link to [LoRA examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/tree/main/lora) on the MLX framework for Mac.

- **Exploring MoE Merges for Fine-Tuned Llama2 Models**: `@philipmay` raised a question about merging two fine-tuned Llama2 models using Mergekit MoE and linked to the [Mergekit on GitHub](https://github.com/cg123/mergekit/blob/mixtral/moe.md). They inquired whether merging a business domain-specific model with a RAG prompting model was sensible since LORA targets the self-attention layers.

- **Adaptation via Merging or Stacking**: In response to `@philipmay`, `@bjoernp` noted that LoRA usually targets all linear layers including FFN layers. `@philipmay` considered either merging for domain adaptation or stacking models, while `@bjoernp` mentioned the trade-off between memory requirements and throughput when using dual MoEs.

- **Skepticism Regarding the Effectiveness of Domain Expert Notion in MoEs**: `@bjoernp` and `@sebastian.bodza` discussed the preliminary nature of MoE merges and the misconception about the "domain experts" in MoEs being too fine-grained to represent specific domains effectively.

- **Practical Considerations for Training and Merging MoEs**: `@philipmay` saw potential in scaling MoE models by having teams develop them independently, and `@bjoernp` acknowledged this as an interesting approach for future large-team production. They further touched upon the possibility of training merged MoEs with Axolotl, to which `@bjoernp` responded that it should work well. 

- **Additional Mergekit MoEs Insights**: `@devnull0` shared a link to a document titled *Perfecting Mergekit MoEs* posted by `@Teknium1` on Twitter, which might be of interest to `@philipmay` and others considering MoE merges.

- **GPU Showdown: 4090 vs 3090 Energy Efficiency**: `@thewindmom` claimed that the **RTX 4090** is much more energy-efficient than the 3090, offering **fp8 training** and vastly superior performance in inference. These observations suggest that choosing the right hardware is crucial for optimization and efficiency based on a model's specific needs.
  
- **Memory Bandwidth's Role in Inference Speed**: In a theoretical assessment of memory bandwidth's effect on inference speed, `@thewindmom` calculated that **RTX 3090** could potentially feed a model through its system almost **44.56 times** per second, suggesting that memory bandwidth may significantly influence performance.

- **Discussing Mac's Compute Limitation**: `@bjoernp` noted that inference on Macs, regardless of optimizations, is still compute-bound and significantly slower than the RTX 4090, particularly in high-throughput scenarios.

- **Local vs High-Throughput Inference Preferences**: `@_jp1_` recommended **Nvidia hardware** for deep learning tasks that require high throughput, finetuning, or inference, suggesting that a fully equipped Mac may be better suited for local, smaller-scale tasks.
