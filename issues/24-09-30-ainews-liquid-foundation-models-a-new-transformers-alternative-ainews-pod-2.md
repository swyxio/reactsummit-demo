> AI News for 9/27/2024-9/30/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **31** Discords (**225** channels, and **5435** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **604 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

It's not every day that a credible new foundation model lab launches, so the prize for today rightfully goes to Liquid.ai, who, 10 months after [their $37m seed](https://siliconangle.com/2023/12/06/liquid-ai-raises-37-6m-build-liquid-neural-networks/), finally "came out of stealth" announcing 3 subquadratic models that perform remarkably well for their weight class:

[![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f4006762-e87d-449a-9acd-7a60e88e20d1.png?w=960&fit=max)](https://x.com/AndrewCurran_/status/1840802455225094147)

We know precious little about "liquid networks" compared to state space models, but they have the obligatory subquadratic chart to show that they beat SSMs there:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/3502168f-ebe5-429f-8c75-cc43fc03852a.png?w=960&fit=max)

with very credible benchmark scores:

Notably they seem to be noticeably more efficient per parameter than both the Apple on device and server foundation models ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-apple-intelligence/)).

They aren't open source yet, but have a playground and API and have more promised coming up to their Oct 23rd launch.

- **Model Loading Challenges**: Users encountered runtime errors related to model configuration files when attempting to load fine-tuned models using the Unsloth library. The issue was primarily due to having both LoRA adapters and base model configurations in the same repository.
   - It was recommended to upgrade the Unsloth library to resolve specific bugs related to model loading.
- **Using Unsloth with BitsAndBytes**: BitsAndBytes allows for the loading of models in quantized formats, with users able to load models in 4-bit or 8-bit configurations. While fine-tuning can be done in 4-bit, loading models in 16-bit post-training is recommended for better inference performance.
   - Users were advised to ensure they are using correct parameters to avoid confusion during model training and inference.
- **Getting Started with Google Colab**: New users were directed to resources for using Google Colab effectively, including links to notebooks with clear instructions. Several models were suggested for beginners to experiment with and explore functionality in a user-friendly format.
   - This ensures that newcomers can quickly acclimate to using the resources available for fine-tuning and deploying models.
