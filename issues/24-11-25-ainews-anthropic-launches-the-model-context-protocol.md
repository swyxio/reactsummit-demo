original_slug: ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context
description: >-
  **Anthropic** has launched the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, an open
  protocol designed to enable seamless integration between large language model
  applications and external data sources and tools. MCP supports diverse
  resources such as file contents, database records, API responses, live system
  data, screenshots, and logs, identified by unique URIs. It also includes
  reusable prompt templates, system and API tools, and JSON-RPC 2.0 transports
  with streaming support. MCP allows servers to request LLM completions through
  clients with priorities on cost, speed, and intelligence, hinting at an
  upcoming model router by Anthropic. Launch partners like **Zed**,
  **Sourcegraph**, and **Replit** have reviewed MCP favorably, while some
  developers express skepticism about its provider exclusivity and adoption
  potential. The protocol emphasizes security, testing, and dynamic tool
  discovery, with guides and videos available from community members such as
  **Alex Albert** and **Matt Pocock**. This development follows Anthropic's
  recent **$4 billion fundraise from Amazon** and aims to advance terminal-level
  integration for **Claude Desktop**.

> The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Similar to the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), MCP how to integrate additional context and tools into the ecosystem of AI applications. For implementation guides and examples, visit modelcontextprotocol.io.

The protocol is flexible enough to cover: 


- **Resources**: [any kind of data](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources) that an MCP server wants to make available to clients. This can include:
File contents, 
Database records, 
API responses, 
Live system data, 
Screenshots and images, 
Log files, 
and more.
Each resource is identified by a unique URI and can contain either text or binary data.
- **Prompts**: Resuable templates and workflows (including multi-step)
- **Tools**: everything from [system operations to API integrations to running data processing tasks](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools#example-tool-patterns).
- **Transports**: Requests, Responses, and Notifications between clients and servers via JSON-RPC 2.0, including support for server-to-client streaming and other custom transports (WebSockets/WebRTC is not mentioned... yet)
- **Sampling**: allows servers to request LLM completions through the client, enabling sophisticated agentic behaviors  (including rating **costPriority, speedPriority, and intelligencePriority**, implying Anthropic will soon offer a model router) while maintaining security and privacy.
