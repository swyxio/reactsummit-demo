- **Implementing Gemma 2 from Scratch**: Over the last 3 days, a member successfully implemented **Gemma 2** from scratch using [Numpy](https://github.com/githubpradeep/notebooks/blob/main/gemma2%20final.ipynb) and later ported it to [Cupy](https://github.com/githubpradeep/notebooks/blob/main/gemma2%20final_cupy.ipynb).
  - The implementation showcases the ability to run Gemma 2 on both GPU and CPU, making it accessible for different hardware setups.
- **Cupy GPU Requirements**: For optimal performance, the **Cupy** version requires a GPU with **24GB** of memory, which is critical for handling the computations efficiently.
  - Alternatively, for GPUs with less than **16GB**, users can run the [Cupy f16 version](https://github.com/githubpradeep/notebooks/blob/main/gemma2%20final_cupy_f16.ipynb) to save memory while executing computations.
- **Running on CPU with Numpy**: Users can still run the implementation on CPU using the [Numpy notebook](https://github.com/githubpradeep/notebooks/blob/main/gemma2%20final.ipynb), providing a broader reach for those without access to powerful GPUs.
  - This option proves useful for testing and smaller scale computations that don't require extensive hardware resources.

- **Emergent Outlier Features in Quantization**: The conversation revolved around the **emergent outlier features** discussed in the [LLM.int8() paper](https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes/blob/e4674531dd54874c0abbc786ad5635c92c34dc3e/bitsandbytes/autograd/_functions.py#L318-L321), leading to questions on their relevance for newer LLMs like Llama 2 and 3.
  - *There’s speculation that improvements in training and architectural changes may mitigate these outliers.*
- **Quantization Method Differences**: **Mobicham** pointed out that static quantization for activations can pose issues, while dynamic quantization tends to perform better, citing results from the SmoothQuant paper with large models.
  - They mentioned that while static quantization impacts accuracy, larger model weights are generally easier to quantize without significant loss.
- **Impacts of Outliers on Weight Quantization**: **Mobicham** conducted tests indicating that **outliers in activation** chemistry heavily influence `W8A8` performance, whereas weight-only quantization exhibits minimal impact.
  - They suggested that models like OPT/BLOOM might be more affected due to older training recipes and architecture.
- **Hopper Support and Limitations**: The user **theultrainstinct** noted that int8 in bitsandbytes isn't supported on **Hopper**, questioning the validity of certain claims.
  - They referenced [additional details](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20835v1) about quantization capabilities and thresholds.
- **Threshold Options in Model Quantization**: **Theultrainstinct** mentioned the ability to set an outlier threshold in quantization, enabling skipping the decomposition step, but warned that some models, like OPT, are sensitive to this adjustment.
  - In contrast, models such as **Llama 2/3** and **Mistral** are noted to perform significantly better under these conditions.

Members discussed nuances of how `sys.argv` may cover this use case.
  - One member suggested trying different command formats to see how arguments are processed.
- **Understanding Destructor Calls in Mojo**: Mojo utilizes an **ASAP destruction policy**, destroying objects as soon as they are no longer needed and calling the `__del__()` destructor immediately. The [Mojo lifecycle](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/lifecycle/death) documentation was referenced to clarify this behavior.
  - Members discussed whether certain functions like `!pop.array` require manual destruction or not, leading to varied opinions.
- **Concerns on InlineFixedVector's Design**: The design choice for **InlineFixedVector** to have inline methods instead of leaving that decision to the inliner was discussed; older programming practices were noted as a potential reason. One member speculated that with upcoming changes, **InlineFixedVector** may soon be phased out in favor of simpler data structures.
  - Another member mentioned that improvements could come once the blocking compiler work allows optimizations in Lists.
- **Query on Weak Reference for Arc**: A member inquired if adding a `Weak` reference for **Arc** would be beneficial or if it is currently on hold. This inquiry indicates an interest in enhancing **Arc's** functionality while managing its requirements.
  - There was also discussion regarding `kgen.variant` and whether it implies automatic behavior on initialization or destruction.
- **Exploring Alternatives to MaybeUninit**: One member questioned alternative representations for **MaybeUninit** without using unsafe methods like byte slice punning. Suggestions for maintaining safety while handling uninitialized data were explored.
  - The discussion reflected on avoiding overly broad requirements on types used in **Arc**.
