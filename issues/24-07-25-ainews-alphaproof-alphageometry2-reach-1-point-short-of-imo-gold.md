It's been a good month for neurosymbolic AI. As humans gather for the 2024 Summer Olympics, AI has been making great advances in Math Olympics. Early this month, [Numina](https://x.com/_lewtun/status/1811426187132166588) won the first AIMO Progress Prize, solving 29/50 private set problems of olympiad math level.

While [6 teenagers on team USA](https://maa.org/news/usa-first-at-imo/) won the 65th International Math Olympiad, taking back China's crown, [Google DeepMind announced](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level) that their new combination of **AlphaProof** and a new V2 of [AlphaGeometry](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry/) solved four out of six problems from the IMO (including [solving Problem 4](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/imo-2024-solutions/P4/index.html) in 19 seconds), with human judges (including the IMO Problem Selection Committee Chair) awarding it 28 points out of a maximum 42, 1 point short of the cutoff for a Gold.

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/feb994bf-9173-45d6-8e11-7562d3243903.png?w=960&fit=max) 

**AlphaProof** is a finetuned Gemini model combined with AlphaZero ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815)) that proves mathematical statements in Lean, and uses an AlphaZero style aporoach to find solutions:
 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/9b361cd6-722b-4bd4-abdd-da67f639535e.png?w=960&fit=max) 

**AlphaGeometry 2** is a neuro-symbolic hybrid system in which the language model was based on Gemini and **trained from scratch on an order of magnitude more synthetic data** than its predecessor. [It] employs a symbolic engine that is two orders of magnitude faster than its predecessor. When presented with a new problem, a **novel knowledge-sharing mechanism** is used to enable advanced combinations of different search trees to tackle more complex problems. Before this year’s competition, AlphaGeometry 2 could solve 83% of all historical IMO geometry problems from the past 25 years, compared to the 53% rate achieved by its predecessor. 

However it's not all roses: [Tim Gowers](https://x.com/wtgowers/status/1816509808876597264), one of the human IMO judges, noted:

> The main qualification is that the program needed a lot longer than the human competitors -- for **some of the problems over 60 hours** -- and of course much faster processing speed than the poor old human brain. If the human competitors had been allowed that sort of time per problem they would undoubtedly have scored higher. 

This is also similar to [2022 OpenAI work](https://x.com/Ji_Ha_Kim/status/1816527854655754566) on Lean provers.

How can AI solve both AIMO problems and fail to solve 9.11 > 9.9? There are a [couple](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1816531576228053133) [thoughts](https://x.com/BlancheMinerva/status/1813955036277526691) on "Jagged Intelligence" that fall to the everpresent problem of generalization.

Nevertheless it's been a big day for [prediction markets](https://x.com/prerationalist/status/1816504073115353116) and [private bets](https://x.com/esyudkowsky/status/1816511787560546465?s=46) on AI in the IMO.
