- **torch.compile primarily uses Triton kernels**: Members discussed that **torch.compile** mostly outputs **Triton kernels** since they are easier to write and generate, maintaining strong performance.
   - While **PyTorch eager** mode does output **CUDA kernels**, there is also a Cutlass backend for **torch.compile**, though its current progress is unclear.
- **CUDA kernels visibility in eager mode queried**: A member inquired if there is a way to view the **CUDA kernels** generated by eager mode similar to how **torch.compile** operates.
   - This reflects ongoing interest in kernel outputs across different modes within the **PyTorch** framework.
- **torchao import issue reported**: An import issue was reported with the statement `from torch._inductor.runtime.runtime_utils import do_bench`, indicating it is broken in the nightly build.

- **Clarification on Flash Attention Block Order**: Discussion on the **Flash Attention** paper clarified that the ordering of KV blocks isn't crucial as they can be scheduled in different orders without changing the algorithm's correctness.
   - However, the pairs of K and V rows must maintain their logical pairing for the algorithm to function properly.
- **Understanding Cooperative Thread Array (CTA)**: Members explained that CTA, or **cooperative thread array**, refers to a parallel worker in CUDA that allows threads in the same CTA to access shared memory.
   - This concept is vital as it delineates the relationship between warps and CTAs in the CUDA execution model.
- **Potential Issues with Naive Maximum Calculation**: Questions were raised about atomicity in memory accesses when calculating `m_i = max(m_i, s_ij)` across multiple threads with varying `j` values.
   - It was clarified that while thread-specific memory accesses are ordered, visibility across different threads doesn't ensure atomicity, requiring synchronization.
- **Significance of 'i' and 'j' in Flash Attention**: The discussion clarified that in the **Flash Attention** algorithm, `i` is a spatial coordinate, while `j` represents a temporal aspect related to the number of KV blocks processed.
   - This distinction is important for understanding how maximum entries are tallied within the algorithm.

- **INT8 Quantized Training Error Resolution**: A member faced an error when implementing FSDP support for a subclass related to **INT8 quantized training**, particularly when calling `torch.chunk()` on a tensor that requires grad.
   - They noted that setting `requires_grad=False` in their implementation of `aten.split.Tensor` resolved the issue, indicating some underlying logic in PyTorch managing this aspect.
- **Observer Usage in Static Quantization**: A member pointed out that in the static quantization calibration flow tutorial, the observers are imported from **torch.ao** instead of the **torchao** repository, suggesting confusion in availability of observer classes.
   - They mentioned the potential to manually calculate averages without an observer, commenting humorously on the ease of using `model(inputs).abs().mean()`.
- **Discussion on Blockwise Quantization Observer**: A need for reimplementing observers for blockwise quantization in **torchao** was highlighted, with a member stating their intention to create a general observer despite time constraints.
   - Another member shared a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/pull/650) for an `AffineQuantizedObserver`, suggesting that customization might be necessary for specific applications, particularly Adaptive Weight Quantization (AWQ).

> - `Triton Language`
> - `Custom Kernels` 


- **Modular's License Permissiveness Under Scrutiny**: A member highlighted that Modular's license for using **max/mojo** is permissive unless you're attempting to commercialize an AI infrastructure platform.
   - Members are questioning what happens if Modular expands into other domains, such as **robotics** or **AI labeling platforms**.
- **Non-Competitive Software Could Become Competitive**: Discussion revealed that if software is not competitive today, but **becomes competitive** in the future, it remains non-competitive under Modular's licensing agreement.
   - However, questions arose about whether development on such software must be *frozen* once it turns competitive.
- **Call for Triton Lang Custom Kernel Users**: A request was made for **Triton lang** users who have written a custom kernel to participate in a one-on-one conversation with the product team.
   - Incentives include receiving some **Mojo swag** for their contributions.
- **Initial Awareness of Triton Language**: A member expressed curiosity, noting it was their **first time hearing about Triton**.
   - This indicates a potential interest in expanding knowledge about newer languages and technologies within the community.
