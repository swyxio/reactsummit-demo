> - `Aider and Swift Language Support`
> - `Automating Command Entry in Aider`
> - `File Detection in Aider`
> - `Repo Size Impact on Aider Performance`
> - `Using GitHub Copilot with Aider` 


- **Aider struggles with Swift language support**: A user inquired about adding **Swift** support to Aider, but another member pointed out that the **tree-sitter** package does not parse Swift files. They referenced documentation indicating that Aider has limitations with certain languages.
   - Further discussion led to the realization that augmenting the repo-map for new languages may require additional effort or custom implementation.
- **Automating Commands in Aider**: A member expressed frustration with Aider providing a list of commands instead of executing them, comparing it to Cursor Compose functionality. They were advised to use different LLM models like *Sonnet* or *gpt-4o* for better results.
   - It was noted that using `aider --deepseek` could help streamline some processes, but users still desired a more integrated experience.
- **Detecting Files Automatically in Aider**: A user asked how to refresh Aider to automatically detect newly created files rather than using the `/add` command. Although commands like `/drop` and `/clean` were discussed, it was concluded that manual addition via `/add` was necessary.
   - A few users confirmed that the autocomplete feature could suggest files once they were recently created, but noted there may be some git-related limitations.
- **Repo Size and Aider Performance**: A user raised a question about the size at which Aider struggles with repo complexity, prompting discussions about experiences with larger repos like *Wine* and blockchain code bases. Members emphasized that managing focus is critical for making changes in larger repositories.
   - Aider performs better on files relevant to the task, and users were encouraged to avoid overwhelming the model with unnecessary files to maintain efficiency.
- **Potential Use of GitHub Copilot API with Aider**: A user asked whether Aider could theoretically use the **GitHub Copilot API**, as their organization has approved Copilot but not other LLMs. This highlights the complexities of organizational approval processes for various AI tools.
   - The intersection of using Aider alongside widely accepted tools like Copilot could pave the way for more flexible integrations in corporate environments.

> - `Word Game Bench`
> - `Consistency Measurement`
> - `Dataset Construction` 


- **Introducing Word Game Bench for Language Models**: **Word Game Bench** is a benchmark designed to evaluate language models on word puzzle games like **Wordle** and **Connections**, with no model currently scoring above **50% average win rate**. It emphasizes interaction and feedback incorporation, with a unique approach to test set management that avoids fixed evaluations to prevent leakage.
   - For more details, visit [Word Game Bench](https://wordgamebench.github.io) and check out the announcement on Twitter by [@zafstojano](https://x.com/zafstojano/status/1829398835585520076).
- **Measuring Consistency in Responses**: A member is exploring ways to compare responses from multiple choice questions to assess consistency when prompts vary slightly, suggesting the use of `process_results` and aggregate functions. They have transformed their dataset to include repeated entries for the same questions along with different prompts for comparison.
   - Another member advised that using the library might not be straightforward, and recommended constructing specific datasets that represent what is needed, though this would require a separate setup for each model.
- **Adjusting Prompts for Consistency Analysis**: A suggestion was made to run the model multiple times on the same dataset, changing the prompts with each run to facilitate comparison among responses. The strategy involves using `doc_to_text` to integrate other prompts for measuring deviations in responses.
   - This approach emphasizes a need for careful handling of the datasets to ensure accurate comparisons and avoid errors during data processing.
