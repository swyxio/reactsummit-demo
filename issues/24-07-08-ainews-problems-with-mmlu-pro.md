We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**462** channels, and **4661** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **534 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

There's been a lot of excitement for [MMLU-Pro](https://x.com/_philschmid/status/1791137274337354166) replacing the saturated MMLU, and, ahead of [Dan Hendrycks making his own update](https://x.com/DanHendrycks/status/1804929811703591345), HuggingFace has already anointed MMLU-Pro the successor in the [Open LLM Leaderboard V2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/blog) (more in an upcoming podcast with Clementine). It's got [a lot of improvements over MMLU](https://x.com/WenhuChen/status/1790597967319007564)... 

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6d389db1-b599-49fb-a88b-0209f7f8a29c.png?w=960&fit=max) 

but... the good folks at /r/LocalLlama have been digging into it and finding issues, first with [math heaviness](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1du52gf/mmlupro_is_a_math_benchmark/), but today more damningly some alarming discrepancies in how models are evaluated by the MMLU-Pro team across sampling params, system prompts, and answer extraction regex:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/8aa9d3eb-510c-49cd-a9e1-78a646bb60e4.png?w=960&fit=max) 

For their part, the MMLU-Pro team acknowledge the discrepancies (both between models and between the published paper and what the code actually does) but [claim that their samples have minimal impact](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro/issues/5#issuecomment-2213291392), but the community is correctly pointing out that [the extra attention and customization paid to the closed models disadvantage open models](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1dw8l3j/comment/lbu6efr/).

Experience does tell us that current models are still highly sensitive to prompt engineering, and **simple tweaks of the system prompt improved Llama-3-8b-q8's performance by 10 points (!!??!)**.

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/e244cd9b-9f8b-45e7-a0bb-b99db1cbc59d.png?w=960&fit=max) 


Disappointing but fixable, and maintaining giant benchmarks are always a messy task, yet one would hope that these simple sources of variance would have been controlled better given the high importance we are increasingly placing on them.

> - `Torchmetrics for Object Detection`
> - `RT-DETR Model Release`
> - `CogVLM2 for Vision-Language Models`
> - `Zero-shot Object Detection Models`
> - `MaskFormer and Instance Segmentation` 


- **Torchmetrics recommended for Object Detection**: Torchmetrics is suggested for object detection metrics and utilized in [official example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/object-detection) with the Trainer API and Accelerate.
- **RT-DETR Model Release**: [RT-DETR](https://x.com/mervenoyann/status/1807790959884665029) is a YOLO-like model for real-time object detection combining convolutions and attention-based transformers.
   - It comes with an Apache 2.0 license, offering the best of both worlds.
- **CogVLM2 for Vision-Language Models**: The [CogVLM2](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/cogvlm2-llama3-chat-19B) is recommended for various tasks with large-scale vision language models, including impressive performance on benchmarks like TextVQA and DocVQA.
- **Zero-shot Object Detection Models**: The Transformers library supports zero-shot object detection models such as OWL-ViT, OWLv2, and Grounding DINO for textual description-based object detection.
   - These models can also perform image-guided object detection as demonstrated in this [demo](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/OWLv2/Zero_and_one_shot_object_detection_with_OWLv2.ipynb).
- **MaskFormer and Instance Segmentation**: MaskFormer models trained on datasets like ADE20k for semantic segmentation can be extended for use in instance segmentation with official scripts newly added [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/instance-segmentation).
   - It is suggested to start from pre-trained COCO models for fine-tuning on instance segmentation tasks.

   - *Beyond assisting human evaluation (e.g., CriticGPT), critiques can directly enhance preference learning*.
- **New architecture replaces RNN hidden state**: @karansdalal shared a new architecture, **Test-Time-Training layers (TTT layers)**, which replaces the hidden state of an RNN with a machine learning model and compresses context through gradient descent on input tokens, as discussed in [their preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04620).
   - This innovation enables **linear complexity architectures** with expressive memory, allowing training of LLMs with millions or billions of tokens in context, with instantiations TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP both matching or beating the strongest Transformers and Mamba.

   - Despite needing substantial compute resources, it is reproducible with publicly available datasets, and there's hope someone like lucidrains might replicate the code.
- **Debate over Terminator model's validity**: Discussion highlighted concerns about many model studies claiming superiority without proper compute-scale comparisons; **Terminator** was critiqued heavily for high compute demands and lack of scaling law evidence.
   - A call was made for scientifically sound comparisons, checking models across a compute scale span instead of arbitrarily picked benchmarks.
- **CapPa caption model needs JAX**: A new caption model, **CapPa**, dropped and training it using JAX has been showcased [here](https://wandb.ai/craiyon/cappa-jax/reports/CapPa-Training-vision-models-as-captioners--Vmlldzo4NDUyNDUz).
   - The GitHub repository providing details is [visualkeras](https://github.com/borisdayma/clip-jax/blob/main/utils/demo_cappa.ipynb).
- **VisualKeras tool introduction**: A potentially helpful tool called **VisualKeras** was introduced to visualize Keras neural network architectures with customizable styling options.
   - [Check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/paulgavrikov/visualkeras) for both layered and graph-style visualizations suitable for different types of neural networks.
