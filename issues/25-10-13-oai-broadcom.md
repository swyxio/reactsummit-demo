title: 'OpenAI Titan XPU: 10GW of self-designed chips with Broadcom'
date: '2025-10-13T05:44:39.731046Z'
description: >-
  **OpenAI** is finalizing a custom ASIC chip design to deploy **10GW** of
  inference compute, complementing existing deals with **NVIDIA** (10GW) and
  **AMD** (6GW). This marks a significant scale-up from OpenAI's current **2GW**
  compute, aiming for a roadmap of **250GW** total, which is half the energy
  consumption of the US. Greg from OpenAI highlights the shift of **ChatGPT**
  from interactive use to always-on ambient agents requiring massive compute,
  emphasizing the challenge of building chips for billions of users. The
  in-house ASIC effort was driven by the need for tailored designs after limited
  success influencing external chip startups. Broadcom's stock surged 10% on the
  news. Additionally, **InferenceMAX** reports improved ROCm stability and
  nuanced performance comparisons between AMD MI300X and NVIDIA H100/H200 on
  **llama-3-70b** FP8 workloads, with RL training infrastructure updates noted.

There's been a lot of chip dealmaking by OpenAI recently to create "the biggest joint industrial project in human history":

- Sept 10: [$300B in compute](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-09-10-oci) from Oracle
- Sept 22: [10GW from NVIDIA](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-09-22-nvda-oai)
- Oct 6: [6GW from AMD](https://x.com/amd/status/1975155370860384576?s=46)

and today, the final shoe drops - as [widely rumored and on schedule, after hiring TPU alums from Google](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-set-finalize-first-custom-chip-design-this-year-2025-02-10/) - **10GW** of OpenAI's own ASIC and systems specifically designed for OpenAI's inference capacity (as Sam says on [the OpenAI podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=qqAbVTFnfk8)).

To put this in scale, all of OpenAI has **2GW** of compute now, majority spent on R&D:

![](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/AkhFZMi62VP2yIV)

and this is 12% of an overall roadmap going to 250GW (half the energy consumption of the United States)

![](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/ek6nyYd2AZvWYCp)

Greg says ambient agents are a big part of the reason why inference demand will go up a lot:

> But I think that we are heading to a world where AI intelligence is able to help humanity make new breakthroughs that just would not be possible otherwise.
> 
> 
> And we're going to need just as much compute as possible to power that.
> 
> Like one example of something very concrete is that we are in a world now where **ChatGPT is changing from something that you talk to interactively to something that can go do work for you behind the scenes.**
> 
> If you've used features like Pulse, You wake up every morning. It has some really interesting things that are related to what you're interested in. It's very personalized. And our intent is to turn ChatGPT into something that helps you achieve your goals.
> 
> The thing is, we can only release this to the pro tier because that's the amount of compute that we have available. And ideally, everyone would have an agent that's running for them 24-7 behind the scenes, helping them achieve their goals. **And so ideally, everyone has their own accelerator, has their own compute power that's just running constantly.**
> 
> And that means there's 10 billion humans.
> 
> We are nowhere near being able to build 10 billion chips.
> 
> And so there's a long way to go before we are able to saturate not just the demand, but what humanity really deserves.
> 

Greg says that they have been working on their ASIC for 18 months, and why they did this in house:

> "There were all sorts of chip startups with novel approaches that were very different from GPUs. And we started giving them a ton of feedback saying, here's where we think things are going. It needs to be models of this shape. And honestly, a lot of them just didn't listen to us, right? And so it's like very frustrating to be in this position where you say we see the direction the future should be going. We have no ability to really influence it besides sort of, you know, just like sort of trying to influence other people's roadmaps. And so by being able to take some of this in-house, we feel like we are able to actually realize that vision."

While nothing yet has been announced with Intel, it is surely not far behind given [the clear interest in the American AI stack](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-09-18-nvidia-intc).

Broadcom's stock jumped 10% (+$150B) on today's news.

# AI Twitter Recap

**Chips, inference TCO, and training infra**

- **InferenceMAX’s nightly TCO readout (AMD vs NVIDIA)**: ROCm stability has improved “orders of magnitude” since early 2024; on Llama‑3‑70B FP8 reasoning workloads and vLLM, MI300X shows 5–10% lower performance-per-TCO than H100 across interactivity levels, with MI325X competitive vs H200. There remain workloads where AMD loses, but the trend is nuanced and rapidly changing as software improves nightly according to InferenceMAX’s runs ([@SemiAnalysis_](https://twitter.com/SemiAnalysis_/status/1977571931504153076)).

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Chinese Open-Model Dominance and LLM Style-Collapse Debate

- [**The top open models on are now all by Chinese companies**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o5v78n/the_top_open_models_on_are_now_all_by_chinese/) (Activity: 482): **A Washington Post analysis argues that current open-LLM leaderboards (e.g., LMSYS/HuggingFace) are topped by models from Chinese companies, with the shared chart visualizing a leaderboard where the highest-ranked open models are from China, indicating a shift in open model leadership away from US/Meta-led stacks. The post links the analysis (gift link) and the image appears to be a comparative ranking/graph highlighting vendors by country, with Chinese labs occupying the top slots. See: https://wapo.st/4nPUBud.** Comments note that this trend has existed for some time and raise concerns about “benchmark-maxxing” in open models, implying possible leaderboard gaming; others mention **NVIDIA** and **IBM** models as competitive but not SOTA, and criticize the chart’s design/readability.
    - Several point out that apparent leaderboard domination may reflect benchmark gaming rather than broad capability: models are being "benchmaxxed" (overfit/prompt-tuned) to public evals like the Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard and LMSYS Chatbot Arena, which can inflate scores without corresponding real-world gains. This highlights risks of test contamination and over-optimization to specific prompts/metrics rather than robust generalization ([Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard), [Chatbot Arena](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/)).
    - One commenter notes solid but non-SOTA U.S. open models from NVIDIA and IBM that remain practical choices: e.g., **NVIDIA Nemotron-4 15B Instruct** (permissive license, tool-use tuned) and **IBM Granite** 8B/20B series (Apache-2.0, enterprise-focused). While they may trail top entries on MT-Bench or Arena ELO, they offer good trade-offs in size, licensing, and stability for deployment contexts ([Nemotron-4-15B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-4-15B-Instruct), [IBM Granite 8B](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-8b)).
    - A question about "No Mistral?" flags that many leaderboards typically feature strong open Mistral models like **Mixtral 8x7B Instruct** (MoE) and occasionally newer variants (e.g., 8x22B), which often rank competitively among open-weight models. If absent, it could indicate the leaderboard’s cutoff date, evaluation suite, or filtering criteria rather than a true capability gap ([Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct)).
- [**I rue the day they first introduced "this is not X, this is <unearned superlative>' to LLM training data**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o58klk/i_rue_the_day_they_first_introduced_this_is_not_x/) (Activity: 491): **OP highlights a pervasive LLM style artifact: the template “This isn’t X, this is <unearned superlative>,” arguing it’s spread across models and is symptomatic of training-data bias and RLHF-driven stylistic homogenization. They speculate this could reflect or accelerate feedback-loop degradation akin to [model collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_collapse), where models trained on synthetic/model-generated text overfit to clichés, amplifying formulaic rhetoric and reducing diversity in outputs.** Top comments are largely humorous and do not add technical substance.
    - A commenter points out that the “This is not X; this is Y” construction is a strong rhetorical device in limited contexts, but LLMs over-generalize it due to the **next-token prediction** objective and frequency bias favoring high-salience templates over context-sensitive judgment. This yields stylistic mode collapse: once a pattern is learned as "effective," models deploy it ubiquitously, with **RLHF/reward modeling** often reinforcing high-engagement clichés; conservative decoding (low temperature/high `top_p`) can further amplify repetition. Proposed mitigations include penalizing cliché templates, adding style-diversity objectives, or conditioning on discourse intent to restore context sensitivity.

### 1. Video Generation Models: Wan 2.2 FLF2V (-Ellary-) and Sora Mainstreaming in Spain

- [**You’re seriously missing out if you haven’t tried Wan 2.2 FLF2V yet! (-Ellary- method)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1o55qfy/youre_seriously_missing_out_if_you_havent_tried/) (Activity: 552): **Showcase of a video made with Wan 2.2 FLF2V using the -Ellary- pipeline (method described here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1nf1w8k/sdxl_il_noobai_gen_to_real_pencil_drawing_lineart/). Technical feedback centers on temporal instability—noticeable camera/character jumps—suggesting VACE for continuity and/or interleaving static mid‑shots; the commenter provides a quick VACE+upscaling comparison clip (https://streamable.com/1wqka3) and references prior long‑video research on consistency and color drift (https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1l68kzd/video_extension_research/). Another recommendation is to favor hard cuts (dropping frames) over allowing periodic micro‑motions every ~3s, which read as artificial artifacts unique to AI workflows.** Commenters converge that VACE significantly improves temporal coherence versus raw FLF2V, while others argue conventional editing (hard cuts) better masks AI motion artifacts and feels more natural to viewers.
    - Multiple users note temporal discontinuities (camera/character jumps) in Wan 2.2 FLF2V outputs and report that integrating **VACE** for clip-to-clip continuity plus inserting static mid-shots reduces visible jumps. A quick A/B example with VACE and upscaling is provided: https://streamable.com/1wqka3, showing improved continuity versus FLF2V-only. Prior long-video research covering issues like color drift and mitigation strategies is referenced: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1l68kzd/video_extension_research/.
    - For reproducibility and better stitching, a native **ComfyUI** workflow that combines Wan with a VACE Clip Joiner is shared: https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1o0l5l7/wan_vace_clip_joiner_native_workflow/. This pipeline focuses on maintaining temporal coherence across segments and reducing camera shifts when assembling longer sequences.
    - The showcased video was built using **Ellary-’s** SDXL-based line-art pipeline, as documented here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1nf1w8k/sdxl_il_noobai_gen_to_real_pencil_drawing_lineart/. Attribution clarifies that the look and line-art transformations come from that method, which can be combined with Wan 2.2 FLF2V for style consistency while generating video.
- [**Sora videos are becoming mainstream content in Spain (@gnomopalomo)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1o5jo62/sora_videos_are_becoming_mainstream_content_in/) (Activity: 1139): **Post claims OpenAI’s text-to-video model Sora is producing content now seen in Spain’s mainstream media (attributed to @gnomopalomo). The linked media (https://v.redd.it/p2ci6clyrvuf1) returns** `HTTP 403 Forbidden`**, indicating Reddit application-layer access control requiring authentication or developer credentials, not a transient network/transport error; see Reddit’s [login](https://www.reddit.com/login/) and [support ticket](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) pages for access/appeals. No concrete technical details (e.g., prompts, resolution, runtime, post-production pipeline) are provided in the post.** Top comments are non-technical; sentiment ranges from concern about *“AAA production standards”* amplifying low-quality trends to casual enthusiasm about the visuals, with no benchmarks or implementation discussion.
    - One commenter raises a technical concern that copyright enforcement will intensify as Sora-generated videos go mainstream: platforms like YouTube/TikTok use content fingerprinting (e.g., YouTube’s [Content ID](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797370?hl=en)) to auto-flag matches (audio and visual), which can trigger automatic claims/blocks even when AI outputs are stylized or transformed. In the EU (including Spain), the DSM Directive’s **Article 17** shifts more liability to platforms if they fail to prevent availability of infringing content, incentivizing aggressive pre- and post-upload filtering; see the directive text and guidance ([EU 2019/790](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj)). Practically, this means Sora content reusing copyrighted music, branded assets, or look‑alike characters may face takedowns or forced monetization to rightsholders unless creators secure licenses or stick to royalty‑free sources.

### 2. Unitree G1 V6.0 Humanoid Agility Demo and ChatGPT Simpsons-Style Outputs

- [**Unitree G1 Kungfu Kid V6.0**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1o5dvr8/unitree_g1_kungfu_kid_v60/) (Activity: 813): [**Unitree G1 Kungfu Kid V6.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5GphCrjx98) appears to be a capabilities demo of the Unitree G1 humanoid performing fast, choreographed martial-arts-style motions (kicks, punches, spins). The sequence highlights dynamic balance and whole‑body coordination under rapid center‑of‑mass shifts and brief single‑support phases, indicating robust tracking/control and footstep placement; however, the video provides no quantitative benchmarks (e.g.,** `DoF`**, joint torque/speed, power, recovery metrics) or controller/training details, so it should be read as a qualitative agility demo rather than a reproducible method or benchmark comparison.**
    - Rapid software-driven progress: one commenter notes the same Unitree humanoid that was "falling over and spasming at trade shows" a year ago now shows markedly improved stability and agility, suggesting major upgrades in the control stack (state estimation, WBC, trajectory planning) without obvious hardware changes. They even argue the routine puts **Tesla Optimus** demos to shame, underscoring how fast iteration on software can translate to locomotion performance gains ([Unitree G1](https://www.unitree.com/g1), [Tesla Optimus](https://www.tesla.com/AI)).
    - Interest in manipulation and end-effectors: curiosity about Unitree’s "dexterous hand attachments" and progress in domains beyond balance/agility (e.g., coordinated hand-arm tasks, contact-rich manipulation, perception). Technical readers want evidence of bimanual skill benchmarks (door opening, tool/tool-use, pick-and-place) or teleop-to-autonomy transfer, ideally with modular end-effectors and reproducible tasks rather than choreography-focused demos.
- [**This is the closest ChatGPT can legally get to generating the Simpsons.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1o5dtts/this_is_the_closest_chatgpt_can_legally_get_to/) (Activity: 1629): **The post shows an AI-generated, Simpsons-adjacent cartoon family, illustrating how hosted LLM/image systems (here labeled “Gemini 2.5 Flash Image,” though the title mentions ChatGPT) apply IP/copyright safety layers to block exact character generation while allowing style-adjacent outputs. Practically, this is enforced via prompt/entity filters and post-generation safety classifiers (e.g., embedding/name matches or visual similarity thresholds), resulting in generic "yellow cartoon family" compositions rather than trademarked likenesses. The examples in comments appear to show similar near-miss renders, highlighting how policy-based decoding and safety gates cause deliberate “style drift” away from protected characters.** Commenters note that local/fine-tuned models without safety layers (e.g., LoRA checkpoints) can reproduce IP more faithfully, whereas cloud models prioritize legal risk and filter prompts/outputs; some debate whether "style" imitation (as opposed to exact character likeness) is legally risky and how reliably similarity detectors can separate the two.
    - A commenter reports better fidelity by first prompting ChatGPT to write a detailed scene and then generating an image from that scene rather than directly asking for a Simpsons image. This two-step approach increases descriptive signal (characters, setting, actions) while avoiding explicit trademarked terms, which likely bypasses stricter IP classifiers yet preserves style priors; their result still shows off-model artifacts (e.g., Lisa’s mouth, Burns/Smithers proportions, Marge’s neck) in the output [example](https://preview.redd.it/aq65zornkvuf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=c76928183fca239207413a3aee56c1a6fdd33ade).
    - Multiple shared outputs illustrate consistent failure modes in stylized character reproduction: facial topology and limb/neck anatomy drift, inconsistent line weights, and proportion errors across characters, even when the palette and layout are close to target style ([ex1](https://preview.redd.it/n6n87k4ijuuf1.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0e2ea33ff7b1e59e0963cad60fb6eb154b8a467), [ex2](https://preview.redd.it/evr31r1mguuf1.jpeg?width=407&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09b2601e8dc1a9f867902d7f793a827f18069e24), [ex3](https://preview.redd.it/6wlgdt6oluuf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4d04196a4cb13395f72228c602d04b928ab49f5), [ex4](https://preview.redd.it/v5c403xc3vuf1.jpeg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=756302bc7c8f61df6f0e2ce238729796e5f7986f)). This suggests the model is optimizing toward a “Simpsons-like” distribution without exact character identity, likely influenced by IP guardrails plus training data variance, leading to near-style matches but unstable character-specific features.
    - There’s mention of using Google’s **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** for similar tasks, implying cross-model viability for style-approximate outputs. While no quantitative benchmarks are provided, the discussion hints that model choice affects adherence to stylistic constraints versus IP guardrails, with both ChatGPT’s image system and Gemini producing recognizable palette/composition but diverging on character-accurate geometry.

### 3. Minimal-caption Meme/Reaction Images (He's absolutely right / Infinite loop / Hmm)

- [**He's absolutely right**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1o5jz20/hes_absolutely_right/) (Activity: 1409): **Non-technical meme/screenshot (“He’s absolutely right”) used as a springboard for a discussion about LLM sycophancy and whether AI reinforces users’ beliefs versus correcting them. Commenters contrast experiences: one says recent models won’t be convinced of falsehoods “especially lately,” implying improved guardrails/factual resistance, while another argues AI now joins social media and partisan media in echo-chamber affirmation. The thread frames AI as a potential “impartial 3rd party” but questions that ideal given confirmation bias and model behavior variability.** Debate centers on whether LLMs are improving at factual correction or remain sycophantic; some view them as useful for error-checking, others believe AI further collapses discourse by validating users alongside existing echo chambers.
    - Several comments surface the known LLM failure mode of “sycophancy” (models agreeing with a user’s stated view regardless of truth), which is partly a byproduct of RLHF optimizing for user satisfaction. Empirical analyses (e.g., **Anthropic’s** study on sycophancy) show models adjust answers to match a user’s signaled identity or preferences, suggesting mitigations like diversified preference data, explicit critique/verification modes, or constitutional-style training can reduce agreement bias. See: https://www.anthropic.com/news/sycophancy and Constitutional AI overview: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073.
    - One commenter claims it’s recently harder to convince models of falsehoods, which aligns with improved truthfulness calibration but is fragile under adversarial prompting (role-play, leading premises, or jailbreaks). The instruction hierarchy (system > developer > user) and prompt injection can still coerce agreement or push models into error, highlighting the need for guardrails like source-grounded RAG, compulsory citation, and self-critique passes before final answers. Background: prompt injection/jailbreak literature (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04764) and truthfulness benchmarks like TruthfulQA (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958).
    - Another thread points to cross-platform echo chambers where social feeds and LLMs can reinforce user beliefs; technically, non-personalized LLMs may still mirror biases present in the user’s prompt/context window. Practical mitigations include retrieval with provenance, uncertainty estimates (calibrated confidence/logprobs where exposed), and prompting for counter-arguments or contradiction checks to counteract prompt-conditioned confirmation. RAG and citation-first generation are commonly recommended to constrain outputs to verifiable sources.
- [**Infinite loop**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1o5jzi5/infinite_loop/) (Activity: 3294): **A screenshot ([image](https://i.redd.it/88hjkfn8uvuf1.jpeg)) shows ChatGPT getting stuck in an apparent infinite response loop, repeatedly outputting the same line (paraphrased in comments as the seahorse‑emoji query), with the OP noting that asking the model why it looped caused it to crash again. Title (“Infinite loop”) and comments indicate reproducibility (another user shares a repro screenshot: [link](https://preview.redd.it/47jna8kovvuf1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f57309a4b5d48f27583284dbb6ba46a634cf45d)), suggesting a decoding/termination condition bug or moderation/guardrail feedback loop during generation.** Commenters mostly joke; one asks for a technical reason but no concrete diagnosis is provided beyond users confirming they can reproduce the looping behavior.
    - A commenter reports ChatGPT repeatedly looping its response and then crashing when asked about the seahorse emoji, asking why this happens; no technical explanation or mitigation is offered in-thread, and no reproduction steps or model/version details are provided ([screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/47jna8kovvuf1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f57309a4b5d48f27583284dbb6ba46a634cf45d)). This is an anecdotal stability issue report (looping/termination) without diagnostics, logs, or environment specifics, so it’s not actionable beyond noting a potential edge case involving emoji handling.

**Theme 2. Hardware Headaches and Performance Puzzles**

- **VRAM Overflows and RAM Prices Plague Builders**: Users find that exceeding **VRAM limitations** tanks performance, dropping from **70 tokens per second (TPS)** to under **2 TPS** when spilling to pagefile. This is compounded by skyrocketing **DDR5 RAM prices**, as seen in [this graph](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1153759714082033735/1427093935221641316/image.png?ex=68ee450c&is=68ecf38c&hm=75a5f9bc87f3aadd074e8083b3ee64bf1eca2ed8116032d44b5fafbe39f0454f&), which some blame on RAM being redirected to the server market.
- **Mojo's GPU Handling Frustrates and Impresses**: Engineers find that **Mojo recompiles code for every GPU** at runtime, a flexible approach, but some are hitting a wall with its type system, particularly **LayoutTensors**, with one user stating *CUDA is orders of magnitude easier to learn and use* for complex scenarios. Community efforts continue, however, with one member sharing their **vulkan-mojo** bindings on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ryul0rd/vulkan-mojo).
- **Groq Stumbles While Flash Attention Shines**: **Groq's** performance on tool call benchmarks surprised users with low scores, with chute percentages falling to **49%**, as detailed in [this tweet](https://x.com/jon_durbin/status/1976986883184853022). In contrast, developers are calling **Flash Attention** *basically free performance* for the significant, easy boost it provides, though it can negatively impact tool calls on some models like **OSS120B**.

**Theme 3. Model Quirks, Copyright Clashes, and Critical Vulnerabilities**

- **Sora and ChatGPT Wrestle with Content Policies**: Users report **Sora** often bans or fails to render copyrighted material like anime fights, as per [OpenAI's usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies). Similarly, **ChatGPT** struggles with realistic face generation, claiming *it can't create realistic faces*, forcing users to find workarounds like adding mistakes in **Paint**.
- **Researchers Uncover Poisoning and Prompt Injection Dangers**: An **Anthropic** paper revealed that as few as **250 malicious documents** can backdoor an LLM, a finding detailed in [their research](https://www.anthropic.com/research/small-samples-poison). In a related discovery, a critical vulnerability in **GitHub Copilot** allowed private source code exfiltration via a camo bypass, an issue highlighted as *so stupid simple and yet it works* in [this blog post](https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/camoleak-critical-github-copilot-vulnerability-leaks-private-source-code).
- **The Ghost in the Machine: AI Spawns "Souls" and Tables**: Users debated faint, repetitive artifacts on **nano-banana AI outputs**, joking *it’s not a watermark, it’s a soul* as they tried to determine if it's a bug or feature. Meanwhile, developers find that **GPT models** persistently generate tables despite instructions to avoid them, leading one to quip, *"You really can't take the tables out of GPT..."*

**Theme 4. Developer Tooling Troubles and Community Connections**

- **Cursor Agents and Aider Configs Confound Coders**: **Cursor** users report that **Background Agents** can shut down unexpectedly when merging code and that integration with **Linear** is buggy. **Aider** users are seeking better ways to manage configurations, like exporting settings to a file and finding a proper discussion forum, since the official [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/discussions) are closed.
- **OpenRouter SDK and LayerFort Raise Red Flags**: Developers using the **openrouter ai-sdk** integration are warned to be *VERY careful*, as the plugin fails to report usage and costs for intermediate steps involving tool calls. Separately, the community labeled [LayerFort](https://layerfort.cloud/) a likely **scam** for advertising unlimited **Sonnet** API access for just **$15/month** after discovering the site was a generic investment company just months prior.
- **DSPy Community Rallies for IRL Meetups**: Enthusiasm is building for in-person **DSPy** events, with a **Boston meetup** organized by members from PyData, Weaviate, and AWS already planned ([registration here](https://luma.com/4xa3nay1)). Community members are now actively volunteering to organize similar gatherings in the **Bay Area and Toronto**.

**Theme 5. Decoding the Science Behind Smarter AI**

- **Researchers Probe Models to Reveal Latent Skills**: A new paper suggests thinking language models don't learn new reasoning skills but rather activate latent ones already in the base model; using sparse-autoencoder probing, researchers extracted steering vectors for **10-20 distinct reasoning routines**, recovering up to **91%** of the performance gap on MATH500 ([details here](https://xcancel.com/cvenhoff00/status/1976633766811734461)). This connects to discussions on the **'Less is More: Recursive Reasoning'** paper, which explores backpropagating only on the final step of deep recursion.
- **Mamba 3 and RWKV Architectures Get Compared**: The community dissected the new [Mamba 3 Paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HwCvaJOiCj), comparing its architecture to **RWKV-7** and noting its replacement of **conv1d** with an adjusted **RWKV tokenshift** mechanism. The consensus is that Mamba 3 is a pared-down version of existing architectures, whose efficiency gains could be valuable in specific scenarios.
- **The Great Optimizer Debate: RMSProp Under Scrutiny**: A technical debate emerged challenging the claimed adaptivity of **Scalar RMSProp**, with arguments that its **1/sqrt(v)** correction factor might actually be detrimental. This contrasts with a hypothetical *anti-Scalar RMSProp* using **sqrt(v)**, questioning fundamental assumptions about how optimizers regulate sharpness and reach stability.

- **CUDA Cores Handle Warp Threads**: Discussion clarified that a **warp** is not assigned to a single **CUDA core**, but rather its **threads** are distributed, potentially using multiple cores for execution.
   - It was suggested a single `add` instruction might execute over **16 cores** with twice the latency of executing over **32 cores**.
- **mbarrier Troubles in DSMEM**: Usage of `mbarrier` in **DSMEM** differs from local **SMEM**, requiring mapping the `&mbar` pointer to block 0 with `__cluster_map_shared_rank` and using `mbarrier.arrive.shared::cluster`.
   - Even with mbarriers, at least **two `cluster.sync()`** calls are needed: one post-initialization and another before blocks exit to ensure `mbarrier_try_wait()` calls return.
- **DSMEM Cluster Sync Debate**: A user questioned the necessity of `mbarrier` when a single `cluster.sync()` after all blocks write to block 0's **SMEM** already seemed to work for cluster reduction.
   - Counterarguments highlighted the need for a `cluster sync` _before_ writing to **DSMEM** to guarantee threadblocks are live, while the user reported no observed race conditions even with large inputs and only one `cluster.sync()`.

- **CuTeDSL Caching Needs Improvement**: A user reports that running a kernel without `cute.compile` incurs significantly higher overhead (**13.3196 ms vs 0.0054 ms**), raising concerns about CuTeDSL caching usability, see [issue 2643](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/issues/2643).
   - Explicit cache management is recommended for production, balancing speed, safety, and flexibility, while the team actively works on ahead-of-time compilation ([discussion 2557](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/discussions/2557#discussioncomment-14073227)).
- **MoE Group GEMM Performance Modeling Intractable?**: A user highlights the challenge of performance modeling for MoE Group GEMM in LLM inference, where some GEMM problems may be compute-bound and others memory-bound.
   - They suggest looking at serving frameworks like vLLM and experimenting with rearranging the order of GEMM problems to optimize performance.
- **Group GEMV outperforms vLLM's Fused MoE**: For low-batch size long decoding, a simple **group GEMV in Triton** outperforms vLLM's fused MoE, emphasizing the importance of data loading optimization.
   - In this specific setup, it's heavily memory-bound so you don't even need MMA (Matrix Multiply Accumulate).

> `Bazel hackery in Modular tests, Testing `acos()` Max op` 


- **Bazel Shenanigans Turn Max Tests into No-Ops**: A member ran into trouble testing a new `acos()` Max op due to **Bazel** not finding the `graph` target defined in `tests/integration/max/graph/BUILD.bazel` (see [PR 5418](https://github.com/modular/modular/pull/5418)).
   - A knowledgeable member explained that it's due to *"some Bazel hackery that essentially turns that test into a no-op"*, which is a *"known oddity"* related to insufficient test files being open-sourced, potentially related to [Issue 5303](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/5303).
- **Relative Imports to the Rescue in Max Ops Files**: A member suggested trying `from ..graph` instead of `.graph` in the ops file, and similarly using `from .. import dtype_promotion` to fix import issues.
   - The suggestion was implemented but the root issue remained: **Bazel** still couldn't find the `graph` target.

- **Automatically test and fix code in **Aider****: A user reported issues with **Aider** generating uncompilable code using **qwen3-coder:30b** and **ollama** with **test-cmd** and **lint-cmd** set.
   - A member suggested turning on the **auto test config** with *yes always*, which should run a test after every change and attempt fixes.
- **Disable **Aider's** prompt for adding files**: A user inquired about an option to prevent **Aider** from prompting to add files to the context, or generally default to *no* for any question.

> `Python 3.11 Upgrade, TinyMesa CPU, TinyMesa Building on Mac, NVIDIA GPU on Mac, Meeting Cancellation` 


- **Python 3.11 Minimum Consideration Sparks Debate**: The team is considering upgrading to **Python 3.11** to utilize the `Self` type feature, though a workaround exists in **Python 3.10**.
   - One member found a way to do what they wanted with **3.10**, so the bump is not immediate.
- **TinyMesa Fork and Mac Build**: A team member forked **TinyMesa** and inquired about its CI build status and **Mac** compatibility.
   - Confirmation was given that it's building in CI, and theoretically should build for **Mac**, prompting an additional **$200 bounty** for a successful **Mac** build.
- **NVIDIA GPU's Mac Comeback**: One member expressed excitement about the prospect of getting **TinyMesa** plus **USB4 GPU** working on **Mac**, potentially marking the first functional **NVIDIA GPU** on **Mac** in a decade.
   - The member thinks that this is so exciting if we get this + USB4 GPU on **Mac**.
- **Meeting off Today**: A member inquired about a meeting, and another confirmed its cancellation due to a previous meeting held at **10am HK time**.
   - They had a meeting before so they are skipping today's meeting.

> `Proxying REST API, LLM-ready APIs, MCP server packaging formats, MCPB repo, Cloudflare MCP` 


- **Proxying REST APIs is Bad Tool Design?**: A member questioned whether *proxying an existing REST API* is generally recognized as a bad tool design and wondered if there were examples of good designs or benchmarks comparing effectiveness.
   - Another member replied that it isn't *necessarily* bad, as its effectiveness depends on the underlying API's design, like whether it uses paginated endpoints or allows filtering applicable to the LLM.
- **Craving Concrete LLM-Ready API Benchmarks?**: A member expressed interest in building *LLM-ready APIs* at their workplace but noted the difficulty without concrete proof or benchmarks.
   - Another member noted that the most useful benchmarks have been **use case specific** and recommended a robust evaluation strategy and tooling rather than relying on outside benchmarks too much.
- **Dreaming of Deterministic MCP Server Packages?**: One member raised the issue of **non-deterministic dependency resolution** at runtime with the current *npx/uv/pip* approach for MCP servers, causing slow cold starts in serverless environments.
   - This same member proposed **deterministic pre-built artifacts** that can cold start in under 100ms and work across different runtimes, essentially treating MCP servers more like compiled binaries and expressed interest in submitting a working group creation request.
- **MCPB Repository Rumblings**: A member inquired about involvement with the [anthropics/mcpb repo](https://github.com/anthropics/mcpb), questioning whether the community aims to remain agnostic on bundling formats.
   - Another member suggested that relevant conversations occur in the <#1369487942862504016> channel, highlighting recent work supporting **MCPB** in the registry and emphasizing the importance of compatibility with the registry API/schemas.
- **Cloudflare Champion Joins MCP Crew**: A new member introduced themself as working on **MCP** at Cloudflare and expressed their enthusiasm to be present.
