   - However, some users reported **404 errors** when attempting to download the Linux version of LM Studio, which is now resolved.
- ****DeepHermes Has Hybrid Reasoning****: Nous Research released new [DeepHermes Preview models](https://huggingface.co/collections/NousResearch/deephermes-67d2ff8c9246cc09a7bd8add), including **24B** and **3B** versions, that are Hybrid Reasoners, allowing users to toggle long chain of thought reasoning on or off.
   - These models use the exact same recipe as the **8B** DeepHermes and are based on SFT alone, but it has some spillover into math even without reasoning.
- ****Zero-Shot Classifier Saves the Day****: A user looking for an embedding model for social media posts was advised to consider a zero-shot classifier like [ModernBERT-large-zeroshot-v2.0](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/ModernBERT-large-zeroshot-v2.0) instead, suggesting discrete categories might be more appropriate than embeddings for grouping items.
   - This model performs slightly worse than DeBERTa v3 on average, but is very fast and memory efficient.

> `Gemma 3, GGUF, Transformers issue, RLHF, H100` 


- **Gemma 3 GGUF versions now available**: Unsloth has uploaded all **GGUF**, **4-bit**, and **16-bit** versions of **Gemma 3** to a [Hugging Face collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/unsloth/gemma-3-67d12b7e8816ec6efa7e4e5b).
   - The uploaded versions include **2-8 bit GGUFs**, **dynamic 4-bit**, and **16-bit** versions, but members noted the models don't support images yet and are working on a fix.
- **Transformers Bug Halts Gemma 3 Fine-Tuning**: A breaking bug in **Hugging Face Transformers** is preventing **Gemma 3** from being fine-tuned, but HF is actively working on a fix and [the blogpost has been updated](https://unsloth.ai/blog/gemma3).
   - The bug affects **Gemma 3** fine-tuning, but it's also caused a mismatch between the documentation and the actual setup for **Gemma 3** in the Jupyter notebook on Colab.
- **GGUFs Explained to Beginners**: **GGUFs** are quantized versions of models designed to run in programs that use **llama.cpp**, such as **LM Studio** and **GPT4All**.
   - The uploaded GGUFs of **Gemma 3** won't work in LM Studio yet, as LM Studio needs to update their **llama.cpp** versions.
- **Exploration into GRPO vs PPO**: Members discussed the usage of **GRPO** vs **PPO** for finetuning, with many indicating that **GRPO** generalizes better and is easier to set up than **PPO**, while also being a possible direct replacement.
   - There was also a discussion on the combination of techniques, with one member noting that **Meta 3** used both **PPO** and **DPO**, and another pointing out that **AI2** still uses **PPO** for VLMs and their big **Tulu** models because they use a different reward system that leads to very up to date **RLHF**.
- **H100 vs 4090 for Inference**: Members debated the efficiency of the **H100** vs the **4090** for running inference, with many claiming the H100 would not outperform the 4090 in prompt processing.
   - Some members explained that the **H100** is only better if you need to batch process or can saturate the memory bandwidth.

> `Gemma 3 27b as a thinking model, GRPO training, Qwen2.5 model template, GGUF models, lora performance problems` 


- **Thinking Model?**: A user asked about making **Gemma 3 27b** a *thinking model*, and another user responded that it already incorporates reasoning internally for efficiency.
   - The model purportedly told them that it does all of its reasoning internally to enhance efficiency.
- **GRPO Training Troubleshooted**: Users discussed training models with **DPO**, **ORPO**, **KTO**, and **GRPO**, eventually resolving finetuning issues.
   - After resolving the finetuning issues, one user stated, *"Tysm guys my finetuning now works perfectly"*.

> `GRPO and response quality, Finetuning for exact output, Structured outputs, Guided decoding accuracy, Qwen2.5-VL-7B finetuning data` 


- **GRPO Boosts Output Quality via Increased Generations**: Members noted **GRPO** works better when at least one generation produces a good response, so increasing the number of generations basically increases your chance of generating a good response.
- **Demand for Exact Finetuning outputs**: A member asked how to finetune a model to generate the exact words in the output and gave an example to reformat dates like `<date>March 5th</date>` without any variations, suggesting to format the dataset accordingly.
   - Another member suggested using *structured outputs* to ensure the model always generates something matching the desired format, like Outlines.
- **Guided Decoding Downs Accuracy During Inference**: It was mentioned that [guided decoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoding_methods) reduces accuracy during inference if the model hasn’t been trained for that format.
   - To mitigate accuracy loss, one can check the top k logprobs and adjust the prompt; finetuning for format plus guided decoding should yield optimal results if 100% format conformance is needed.
- **Slim Attention Claims Memory Cut Without Accuracy Loss**: A member shared a link to the paper [Slim attention: cut your context memory in half without loss of accuracy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05840), noting the headline claim that *K-cache is all you need for MHA*.
   - Another member questioned why anyone would use this over MLA.
- **Unsloth's Datasets 101 guide offers advice**: A member shared the [Unsloth's Datasets 101 guide](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/datasets-101) but another member noticed that the guide was for LLMs, not VL models.
   - The member was looking for a source/code on how to prepare data to fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B, specifically a CSV of video.mp4,caption.

   - Many will now use **Gemma** as their main model.
- **Gemma 3 Text-Only MLX has Borked**: A user reported that Gemma 3's MLX model is outputting endless `<pad>` tokens, making it unusable for text generation, but members found **image** generation still works.
   - The workaround is to either use the **GGUF version** or provide an image.
- **Gemma 3's Token Generation Speed Woes**: Users report **Gemma 3** is generating tokens at 1 tok/sec, much slower than other similarly sized models, using about 5% GPU and 50% CPU.
   - It was suggested to use the model options to crank up the **GPU** and check if it is indeed being utilized, since it sounds like the model is using **CPU** instead.
- **Context Causes Catastrophic Gemma Crash**: Members discovered that **Gemma 3** and **Qwen2 vl** crashes when the context is greater than **506 tokens** and spams `<unusedNN>`, with the number varying.
   - A new engine was released with a fix for this, available by updating to v1.20.0 in Runtime Extension Packs.
- **LM Studio is Local Only**: A member asked if it was possible to use cloud models in **LM Studio**.
   - Another member swiftly replied that **LM Studio** is designed for *local models only*.

> `Vulkan vs ROCm speed, 9070 GPU breaking, 7900 XTX Hotspot issues, PTM 7950 thermal paste, Nvidia CMP-40HX for AI inference` 


- **Vulkan Lagging Behind ROCm, Driver Downgrade Suggested**: Users reported that **Vulkan** runs slower compared to **ROCm**, with one suggesting downgrading to driver version **24.10.1** for testing purposes, though another user hesitated due to already using version **25.3.1** and planning a CPU upgrade from **5800X3D** to **9800X3D**.
   - It was suggested to use **AMD CleanUp** for driver changes without OS reinstall, while another user mentioned achieving **37.3 tokens/s** with a **7900 XTX** on **Mistral Small 24B Q6_K**.
- **9070 GPU Bites the Dust**: A user reported their **9070 GPU** broke, causing the PC to not boot, and after troubleshooting, it was determined that the motherboard's RAM LED remained on, preventing BIOS access, despite trying different slots and a separate **7900 XTX** which worked.
   - The user tried booting with one **RAM** stick at a time, but will proceed with **RMA** due to the issues, while others speculated on whether it was a **PCI-E Gen 5** issue and recommended testing in another machine or forcing **PCI-E 4**.
- **7900 XTX Hotspot Temp Reaching Boiling Point**: A user reported their **7900 XTX** hitting **110°C**, leading to throttling, which prompted suggestions to check the hotspot delta and consider RMA, with references made to early card issues involving vapor chambers and AMD's initial stance on the temperatures being within spec.
   - Links to articles were shared discussing **AMD** declining **RMA** requests for **7900 XTX** cards hitting **110C**, along with confirmations of vapor chamber issues and mounting pressure/thermal paste quality affecting temperatures.
- **PTM 7950 Gaining Popularity**: Members weighed in on **PTM 7950** from **Honeywell** and **Kryosheet** from **Thermal Grizzly** as replacements to address thermal paste pump-out issues, particularly after warranty periods, noting **PTM's** longevity and self-sealing properties due to its viscosity under pressure and temperature.
   - Discussion included cautionary advice on GPU disassembly, checking for hidden screws, and careful separation of the PCB from the cooler to avoid damaging thermal pads.
- **Recycling Mining GPU for AI Inferencing**: A user inquired about a used **Nvidia CMP-40HX** for AI inference, priced similarly to a **GTX 1080**, highlighting its **288 tensor cores**, however, it requires patching Nvidia drivers and might face system crashes due to its mining focus, recommending TDP reduction and underclocking.
   - Another user mentioned limitations around the **PCIe** bandwidth for inference performance, pointing to a github repo [NVIDIA-patcher](https://github.com/dartraiden/NVIDIA-patcher) which provides a patcher to get it to work.

> `Gemma 3 Release, OlympicCoder Model, Zed's Edit Prediction, Aider MCP Server, Claude's text_editor Tool` 


- ****Gemma 3** is Here!**: Google has released **Gemma 3**, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models built from the same research and technology that powers their **Gemini 2.0 models** [https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-3/].
   - The new models are multimodal (text + image), support over **140 languages**, have a **128K context window** and come in **1B, 4B, 12B, and 27B sizes**.
- ****OlympicCoder** is a Model Athlete!**: The **OlympicCoder** model, a **7B parameter model**, reportedly beats **Claude 3.7** and is close to **o1-mini/R1** on olympiad level coding [https://x.com/lvwerra/status/1899573087647281661].
   - It comes with a new **IOI benchmark** as reported in the **Open-R1 progress report 3**, and claims were made that no one was ready for the release.
- ****Zed** Anticipates Edits with **Zeta**!**: **Zed** is introducing [edit prediction](https://zed.dev/blog/edit-prediction) powered by **Zeta**, their new open source model.
   - The editor now predicts the user's next edit, which can be applied by hitting **tab**, and the model is currently available for free during the public beta.
- **Aider in the **MCP**?**: There was a proposal to create an **Aider MCP server**, allowing Claude to self-architect and edit using Aider functionality.
   - The idea is to make Aider more portable and accessible within the Claude app, potentially using cheaper models for edits with Claude handling the planning, with some implementors offering to cook the new feature "tonight".
- **Anthropic Releases **text_editor** Tool!**: Anthropic has introduced a new [**text_editor tool**](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1900235474326966556) in the Anthropic API, designed for apps where Claude works with text files.
   - The tool enables Claude to make targeted edits to specific portions of text, reducing token consumption and latency while increasing accuracy, which means there may be *no need for an editor model*.

> `Drop Repo Map, Add Websearch, Claude 3.7, LM Studio error, aider vs ChatGPT` 


- **Users Ask How to **Drop the Repo Map****: Some users were curious how to *drop the repo map* and whether it was possible to make **aider** aware of all files without specifying them individually.
   - A user suggested to *add the files that need to be changed to the chat*, recommending against adding too many to avoid confusing the LLM, pointing to the [Aider documentation](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/tips.html) for more guidance.
- **Users Explore **Websearch Functionality** in Aider**: One user inquired about adding **websearch functionality** to aider to find solutions online and access recent library documentation.
   - It was mentioned that you can use `/web <url>` to add URLs to the chat, which aider can then scrape for relevant text to use as context, though one user noted they *had to alter the code a little to make it work*.
- **Users Discuss the **Thinking Model** in Claude 3.7**: Users discussed whether it's possible to **hide the thinking process** of Claude 3.7 in Aider, with one user wondering if the behavior changed in the latest release.
   - While there's no current option to hide the thinking output, some find it helpful for terse prompts and debugging, while others find it distracting and prefer a faster response.
- **User Reports **LM Studio Error****: A user reported an error with **LM Studio**, specifically `error loading model architecture: unknown model architecture: 'gemma3'`.
- **User Finds Aider **Dumber Than ChatGPT**, Seeks Advice**: A user expressed frustration, finding Aider *dumber than the $20 ChatGPT subscription*, citing issues with file handling, token costs, and inconsistent behavior.
   - Suggestions included using `/read` instead of `/add` for context files, creating a `CONVENTIONS.md` file for project guidelines, and adjusting settings in `.aider.model.settings.yml`, also noting that [DeepSeek's free r1 endpoint](https://openrouter.ai/docs) is an option for testing.

> `LLMs for Code, Using LLMs, AI Assisted Programming, Productivity Boost from LLMs, LLMs to learn new languages` 


- **LLMs: Harder to Code Than Thought**: A [blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/) notes that using **LLMs to write code** is difficult and unintuitive, requiring significant effort to figure out its nuances.
   - The author suggests that if someone claims **coding with LLMs is easy**, they are likely misleading you, and successful patterns may not come naturally to everyone.
- **LLMs as a Launchpad, Not a Finish Line**: A member stated a bad initial result with LLMs isn’t a failure, but a starting point to push the model towards the desired outcome.
   - They care about the productivity boost from LLMs not for faster work, but to **ship projects** that wouldn’t have been justifiable otherwise.
- **LLMs: Language Learning Accelerators**: One user reported learning more about languages like **Python** and **Go** thanks to **AI assistance**.
   - Without **AI**, they wouldn't have bothered learning these languages.
- **LLMs spark Cambrian explosion level event**: One member, familiar with **Swift**, mentioned previously being deterred from developing apps due to the time investment required to learn a new language.
   - With **LLMs**, it's a whole new Cambrian explosion level event. *Humans in 10 years will look like this... 👽*

> `ANUS AI naming, Windows app Apple ID, Sonar LLM, Model selector issues, Comet Browser` 


- **ANUS AI Naming**: Members humorously discussed naming an AI agent **ANUS**, with the code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikmcfly/ANUS).
   - One member joked, *'Sorry boss my anus is acting up I need to restart it'*.
- **Apple ID Login Issue on Windows App still persists**: Users are still experiencing the **500 Internal Server Error** when trying to authenticate Apple account login for Perplexity’s new Windows app.
   - Some reported success using the Apple relay email instead; and other suggested to login using Google.
- **Sonar LLM**: **Sonar** is confirmed as Perplexity's own fast **LLM** used for basic search.
   - The overall consensus is that the web version of Perplexity is better than the mobile app, one user claiming that Perplexity is still the best search site overall.
- **Model Selector Vanishes, Causes Confusion**: Users reported that the **model selector** disappeared from the web interface, leading to frustration as the desired models (e.g., R1) were not selectable.
   - Members used a [complexity extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/complexity-perplexity-ai/pahbgjllcaopfapghkchmpeokpgeleji) as a hacky workaround to revert back to a specific model.
- **Perplexity Pro Losing Context**: Several users noted that **Perplexity Pro** seems to be losing context in conversations, requiring them to constantly remind the AI of the original prompt.
   - As such, *Perplexity's context is a bit limited*.

> `SentenceTransformer training with PyTorch, Data augmentation for text translation, COLING paper on translation` 


- **Training SentenceTransformers Natively**: A member inquired about resources or methods to train a `SentenceTransformer` using native PyTorch.
   - The question implies a desire to potentially avoid using the high-level `transformers` library, and directly implement the training loop with PyTorch modules.
- **Augmenting Data for Text Translation Projects**: A question was raised about the feasibility of using data augmentation techniques in text translation projects.
   - The member aims to improve model generalization and performance by artificially expanding the training dataset with modified versions of existing text samples.
- **COLING Paper Inspires Translation Training**: A member referenced [a paper from COLING 2025](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.468.pdf) as a benchmark for desired results in their translation project.
   - They are seeking advice on implementing similar techniques or architectures described in the paper to achieve comparable performance.

- **Tokenizer Template Chat Format**: A member shared their implementation for processing a dataset to pass through a tokenizer template: `tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=False)` to format `messages` into a `chat_format` string.
- **Agent Fails to Use Intended Color Mixing Tool**: A member reported that their agent did not use the intended color mixing tool, instead opted to generate its own python script for color mixing.
   - The member was testing a dummy agent and found that even with a predefined `@tool` section with their color mixing code, the agent ignored it.
- **Tool List Inclusion Resolves Agent's Tool Selection**: A member discovered that the agent's failure to use the correct tool was due to the tool not being defined in the agent's **tool list**.
   - The member had forgotten to include their defined color mixing tool in the list of available tools for the agent to use.

- **Copyright Violation Cases Arise**: There are now a bunch of court cases that ask whether or not training a generative machine learning model on data that is copyrighted is itself a [copyright violation](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2025/privacy-copyright-and-generative-models.html).
- **Models output verbatim training examples**: Papers show machine learning models can output verbatim training examples ([text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805) or [image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13188)).
   - Lawyers in these cases often point to these papers as evidence that models either do, or do not, violate copyright.
- **Privacy and Security concerns grow**: A member writes on the "memorization" problem from a **privacy and security angle**: it would be bad if a hospital trained a model on patient data and then released the model, because an attacker could query the model to recover specific patient medical information.

   - It outperforms zero-shot or SFT on **MetaAD**, a new dataset of **110K 3s clips**, and ablations showed that SFT < RL < SFT + RL, suggesting that *the days of pure SFT are over*.
- **SFT + RL best**: Ablations on the new **MetaAD** dataset shows that combining Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) yields better performance than either technique alone.
   - These findings suggest that a hybrid approach leveraging the strengths of both SFT and RL is optimal for training reasoning VLMs in autonomous driving.

- **Deep Learning grows like Farming**: A member shared a [Substack post](https://open.substack.com/pub/arjunsriva/p/on-deep-learning-and-farming?r=68gy5&utm_medium=ios) exploring the parallels between **deep learning** and **farming**, framing it as a more complex version of elicitation theory.
   - The post contrasts **engineering** (deliberate composition) with **cultivation** (indirect influence), suggesting that deep learning resembles cultivation because we can't directly build models but rather guide their development.
- **Engineering versus Cultivation**: The post posits two fundamental ways to make things: **Engineering**, which involves understanding and deliberately composing sub-components, and **Cultivation**, where direct construction is not possible.
   - It suggests **deep learning** is more akin to cultivation, as we guide rather than directly build models.

- **AI Engineer Seeks LLM Training Career Advice**: An aspiring AI engineer with experience in **Attention Is All You Need**, **nanoGPT**, **GPT-2**, and **LLaMA2** seeks guidance on whether to pursue **CUDA** optimization or job applications, aiming for a career in **LLM training** at a big tech company.
   - Feedback suggests focusing on understanding how **LLMs** are trained and attending AI conferences to network with professionals in desired roles, while hands-on experience with the *trl library* could be beneficial.
- **Python Dependency Indexing in VSCode Troubles**: A member raised concerns about **VSCode** indexing thousands of Python files from dependencies like **torch** and **transformers**, exceeding the editor's file limit and causing errors.
   - Suggestions included excluding the virtual environment folder from indexing to prevent unnecessary scanning of dependency files, potentially resolving the issue while maintaining functionality like *go to definition* and *autocomplete*.

> `TTT Acceleration, DeltaProduct Gradient, Dynamic Computation, Thinking Tokens, AIME 24 evaluation` 


- **TTT Boosts Priming Process**: Members discussed how **TTT** accelerates the priming process by shifting the model's state towards being primed for a specific prompt with just *one* gradient descent pass.
   - The transformer learns and attempts to perform *multiple* gradient descent passes for every token predicted, optimizing the sequence for a useful representation, thereby explicitly aiding **ICL** and **CoT**.
- **DeltaProduct Mimics Multiple Gradient Passes**: Someone noted that **DeltaProduct** can be seen as performing multiple gradient descent passes per token, increasing expressiveness in state tracking, while viewing **TTT** as a form of **ICL**.
   - They expressed confusion on **TTT**'s relevance to a blog, noting the blog's methods differ significantly from standard **TTT**.
- **Decoder-Only Architecture Gains Dynamic Thinking**: A proposal suggested bringing back a concept from encoder-decoders to a decoder-only setup, using the decoder for dynamic computation, extending sequence length for internal "thinking" with **FlexAttention**.
   - It was suggested that the number of "inner" **TTT** expansion steps could be determined by measuring the delta of the **TTT** update loss, stopping when below a median value, which makes it possible to greedily train minimization.
- **Thinking Tokens Expand Internally**: One discussant proposes using a hybrid attention model to expand "thinking tokens" internally, using the inner **TTT** loss on the RNN-type layer as a proxy, and doing cross attention between normal tokens and normal tokens plus thinking tokens internally.
   - It was noted that the main downside is how to choose arbitrary "thinking expansions" since the **TTT** loss can't easily be known in parallel, a problem that can be addressed through random sampling or proxy models.
- **AIME 24 Unveiled**: Attendees wondered what **QwQ** and **DeepSeek** mean when they talk about **AIME 24 evaluation** and found [this HF dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Maxwell-Jia/AIME_2024).
   - Some mentioned that the dataset is copied from [AoPS wiki solutions](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2024_AIME_II_Problems), and expect they just used the wiki, since it is kind of the authoritative source on math competitions.

> `Evaluating patching effect on Chain of Thought (CoT) answers, LatentCache construction for interpretability, Delphi library for activation collection` 


- **Analyzing Patching Effects on CoT Reasoning**: A member is seeking advice on how to evaluate the effect of patching on **Chain of Thought (CoT)** answers, especially when patching leads to gibberish outputs that are difficult to compare.
   - They proposed evaluating the log likelihood of each token in a pre-extracted CoT sequence after patching the model with certain activations, but is seeking advice to validate the method.
- **Considering LLMs as Judges in Patching Analysis**: A member suggests considering using **LLMs** as judges to evaluate the effect of patching on reasoning models.
   - They also propose checking for the presence of the right answer in the overall string of answers, while acknowledging the potential for false positives.
- **Delphi Activation Collection Methodology**: A member inquired about how **latents** are collected for interpretability using the **LatentCache**, specifically whether latents are obtained token by token or for the entire sequence.
   - Another member clarified that **Delphi** collects activations by passing batches of tokens through the model, collecting activations, generating similar activations, and saving only the non-zero ones, and linked to <#1268988690047172811>.
- **Adapting Delphi for Custom Models**: A member is attempting to adapt the **Delphi** library for a custom model that isn't based on the Transformer AutoModel.
   - They are specifically wondering whether to get the activations for the whole sentence or one token at a time with an independent forward pass.

   - They stated they based it off of the **MATH** implementation since they couldn't find any documentation of what people are running when they run **AIME24**.
- **`math_verify` Utility Suggested**: A member suggested using the `math_verify` utility, showing an example of how to use `parse` and `verify` from the module.
   - They noted that the main issue is that `parse` accepts a **Config object(s)** so slightly tricky to create wrapper for it.
- **Plans for `math_verify` Unification**: A member inquired if the `math_verify` utility will be used to unify the implementation of mathematics tasks more generally.
   - Another member responded that they have added it to `minerva_math`.
- **Multilingual perplexity evals search**: A member inquired about whether there were any **multilingual perplexity evals** already available in **lm-eval-harness**.
   - They also asked if anyone knew of any particularly good high-quality **multilingual datasets** appropriate for this purpose.

> `Flash model issues, OpenRouter API delay, Gemma model performance, Gemini 2 Flash native image output, Chutes free inference` 


- **Flash Model Feels Wonky Before Stable Release**: Users speculate that **Flash** model is behaving strangely due to the imminent stable release, consistently making errors in previously successful prompts.
   - *It's making a lot of strange mistakes consistently in a prompt it was fine with for months*.
- **OpenRouter API Accounting Glitch**: Users reported that the [OpenRouter API](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/generation?id=) for retrieving request details returns a **404 error** immediately after the request finishes, requiring a wait time.
   - The team is working on adding built-in accounting to the stream end to eliminate the need for this API.
- **Gemini 2 Flash Gets Native Image Output**: Google AI Studio has released an experimental version of **Gemini 2.0 Flash** with native image output, accessible via the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api) and Google AI Studio.
   - This new capability combines multimodal input, enhanced reasoning, and natural language understanding to create images.
- **Cohere Drops Command A, Battles GPT-4o**: Cohere introduced **Command A**, claiming it is on par or better than **GPT-4o** and **DeepSeek-V3** across agentic enterprise tasks with significantly greater efficiency, see [Cohere Blog](https://cohere.com/blog/command-a).
   - The new model aims for maximum performance across agentic tasks with minimal compute requirements and competes with **GPT-4o**.
- **OpenAI Calls for Bans on PRC-Produced Models**: OpenAI proposed banning models from PRC-supported operations, labeling **DeepSeek** as *state-subsidized* and *state-controlled*, raising concerns for US companies serving these models, see [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/openai-calls-deepseek-state-controlled-calls-for-bans-on-prc-produced-models/)

- **Command A launches with max performance!**: Cohere has launched **Command A**, a model that is on par or better than **GPT-4o** and **DeepSeek-V3** across agentic enterprise tasks, with significantly greater efficiency, announced in [this blog post](https://cohere.com/blog/command-a).
   - It is available via API as `command-a-03-2025` and already accessible on the chat on their site, with access on **Ollama** coming, according to Cohere's **sssandra**.
- **Command A troubles with API at start.**: Users reported errors when using **Command-A-03-2025** via the API, which was attributed to the removal of `safety_mode = “None”` from the model's requirements.
   - A member found that removing this setting resolved the issue, as **Command A** no longer supports it; **Command R7B** also had this setting removed.
- **Command A on HuggingFace**: A user flagged that the links to the docs pages from the **HuggingFace** page don't seem to work, pointing to [an incorrect link](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a-hf).
   - The correct link to the **HuggingFace** specific documentation for **Command A**, which includes prompt format info, is [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a-hf).
- **Command A for Continued Dev Chat Use**: A member has made the switch to **Command A** for continued dev chat use, noting that it is great at sandbox, creative, and short, but unlike **hiaku 3.5** it is not harmful.
   - Another member mentioned *respecting a lot about Cohere* is the contextual vs strict safety mode, suspecting models being trained to classify all **NSFW** (including of age consenting adults) as unethical could lead to latent space vector confusion, and pointed to a relevant [LessWrong article](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post).

> `Chat API seed parameter issue, OpenAI Compatibility API errors, Tool parameters validation in Cohere API` 


- **Seed Parameter Anarchy Unleashed!**: A member reported that the `seed` parameter in the Chat API was not working as expected, causing different outputs for the same input and seed value, using models such as **command-r** and **command-r-plus**.
   - After initial inability to reproduce, one of the Cohere team [confirmed the issue](https://link.to/message) and the team is investigating; a user later asked *for details of the use-case for the seed parameter*.
- **OpenAI Compatibility API throws 400 Error**: A user encountered a **400 error** while using the OpenAI Compatibility API, specifically with the `chat.completions` endpoint and model **command-a-03-2025**, related to schema validation.
   - After some back and forth, it was determined that the Cohere API was validating the `parameters` field in the `tools` object, even when it was empty which doesn't happen on OpenAI, but later the decision was made to [match OpenAI's behaviour](https://link.to/matching).
- **Mandatory Tool Parameters Trigger Tantrums**: A user discovered that the Cohere API's Compatibility layer mandates the inclusion of the `parameters` field within the `tools` object, even when there are no parameters to pass.
   - While the OpenAPI spec indicates that `parameters` is required, OpenAI does not validate its presence, prompting Cohere to [align with OpenAI's behavior](https://link.to/aligning) for better compatibility. It was also pointed out that the spec that was sent was for the *Responses API*, not chat completions.

### **MCP (Glama) ▷ #[general](https://discord.com/channels/1312302100125843476/1312302100125843479/1349336897520144384)** (94 messages🔥🔥): 

> `Glama MCP server API, Python SDK Logging, Claude image object rendering, NPM packages, RAG vs MCP` 


- ****Glama** API Boasts More Data per Server**: A member noted that **Glama's** new API ([https://glama.ai/mcp/reference#tag/servers/GET/v1/servers](https://glama.ai/mcp/reference#tag/servers/GET/v1/servers)) lists all the tools available and has more data per server compared to Pulse.
   - However, Pulse was noted to have more servers available.
- ****Model Context Protocol Logging****: A member inquired about logging directly to the `/library/logs/claude` directory using the Python SDK, and it was clarified that the client determines the log location, while the server can send log messages following the [Model Context Protocol specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/utilities/logging/).
- ****No Elegant Way** for Claude to Render Images?**: After generating a simple Plotly image and struggling to render it in the main section of Claude, a member stated that there's no elegant way to force **Claude Desktop** to pull out a resource like that and render it in e.g. an artifact, so it's better to just use something like `open`.
   - Others pointed to examples such as [this wolfram alpha MCP](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/MCP-wolfram-alpha/blob/a92556e5a3543dbf93948ee415e5129ecdf617c6/src/mcp_wolfram_alpha/server.py#L111C1-L120C35) which takes the rendered graphs and returns an image; but it shows up inside the tool call, which is a limitation of Claude.
- ****NPM Package Caching****: A member asked where the client stores the npm package/source code and if it accesses it from the cache if the client requests it again and another member answered that you can try checking `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\npm-cache` under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.
   - They also asked how to show in a client which servers are downloaded and whether they are connected, and the answer was that figuring out which servers are downloaded isn't easy and that the client must implement logic to track server states.
- ****Beginner Asks**: RAG vs MCP?**: A new user asked about the difference between **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, seeking a simplified explanation for the motivation behind using MCP.
   - A more experienced member stated that *to maintain chat history, you can get a GDPR data export and load it into a vector store* and pointed to [this chromadb MCP server](https://github.com/privetin/chroma) as a viable solution.

> `VectorAdd zeros, GPU programming mantra, W4A8 linear kernel, SVDQuant` 


- **VectorAdd Submission's Zero Output Debacle**: A member reported their **vectoradd submission** was returning zeros, despite working on Google Colab.
   - The member later found a bug where the code was processing the same block repeatedly, resulting in high throughput; fixing it brought the throughput to the same level as **PyTorch's implementation**.
- **Sadhguru's GPU Programming Wisdom**: A member shared the GPU programming mantra: *if it's too fast, there's probably a bug somewhere* - Sadhguru.
   - This highlights the importance of verifying correctness, especially when performance seems unexpectedly high.
- **W4A8 Kernel Precision Discrepancy**: A member wrote a **W4A8 linear kernel** fused with a **LoRA adapter**, but the output difference between their **Triton kernel** and **PyTorch** could be as big as `1.0`.
   - The member is investigating whether the precision difference between the **Triton kernel** and **PyTorch** is the cause of the gap and if there's any way to reduce it, and others shared their own code at [GitHub](https://github.com/rishabh063/tritonKernel_svdQuant/blob/main/svdConversion.ipynb).
- **SVDQuant Kernel Precision**: A member shared they are working on a kernel similar to **SVDQuant** but all in one kernel.
   - Another member replied their approach is getting `0.03`, but the original poster is still trying to recover the precision, blaming it on forgetting to do boundary checks in loading block ptr.

> `Funnel Shift vs. uint64_t, Trellis Scheme Quantization, CUDA 12.4.0 vs 12.4.1, GPU max value algorithm` 


- **Funnel Shift Might be Faster Than uint64_t Shift**: A member questioned if using `__funnel_shift` is faster than putting two `uint32_t` values into a `uint64_t` and shifting, proposing `uint64_t u = (uint64_t(a) << 32) | b; return (u >> shift) & 0xFFFF;`.
   - Another member expressed surprise that `__funnel_shift` could be faster, suggesting it might use a less congested pipe, but noted that [performance may depend on the surrounding code](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20240510-00/?p=109750).
- **Trellis Scheme uses Overlapping Bitfields**: A member explained a trellis scheme where a tile of 16x16 weights is represented in 256*K bits, with each weight using 16 of those bits, such as weight 0 being bits [0:16] and weight 1 being bits [3:19].
   - They also noted that shift amounts are static and periodic, and they can permute each tile prior to quantization to dequantize straight into tensor fragments, but the periodicity is a little wonky for some bitrates.
- **CUDA 12.4 Update 1 Notes Online**: Members shared links to the [CUDA 12.4.0 download archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive) and [CUDA 12.4.1 download archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-1-download-archive), questioning the differences between the two.
   - One suggested searching "4 update 1" within the [CUDA Toolkit Release Notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/12.4.1/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html) to find changes specific to 12.4 update 1.
- **GPU parallel reduction can find max value**: A new GPU programmer sought help finding the biggest element in a large table and shared a code snippet.
   - A member suggested that having multiple threads simultaneously writing to the same output memory location is generally a bad idea and suggested using a technique called *parallel reduction*.

- **UT Austin Deep Learning lectures unveiled**: Lectures from the **Deep Learning** classes at **UT Austin** are publicly available at [ut.philkr.net](https://ut.philkr.net/advances_in_deeplearning/), covering topics from getting started to modern **GPU architectures**.
   - The courses seem to be very high quality and relevant.
- **OpenCL vs CUDA Throwdown**: A discussion resurfaces an *interesting flame war from 2015* ([github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/22](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/22)) regarding the addition of **OpenCL support** to **TensorFlow**.
   - At the time, TensorFlow only supported **CUDA**.
- **Modular Riffs on CUDA Alternatives**: A relevant article ([modular.com](https://www.modular.com/blog/democratizing-ai-compute-part-5-what-about-cuda-c-alternatives)) from **Chris Lattner** discusses why previous attempts to create portable **GPU programming models** using C++ have failed to gain traction.
   - The article is part 5 of Modular’s “**Democratizing AI Compute**” series.
- **SYCL is not just another CUDA clone**: Discussion around **SYCL**'s portability and various implementations like **AdaptiveCpp** (previously hipSYCL) and **triSYCL**, with **Intel** being a key stakeholder.
   - One participant notes that they find SYCL more interesting than HIP because *it isn't just a CUDA clone and can therefore improve on the design*.
- **Block Diffusion Language Models are here**: A new paper ([openreview.net](https://openreview.net/forum?id=tyEyYT267x)) introduces **Block Diffusion**, a method interpolating between autoregressive and diffusion language models, boasting high quality, arbitrary length, KV caching, and parallelizability.
   - Code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/kuleshov-group/BD3-LMs), with a Hugging Face collection also available.

> `GPU architecture beginner book, Programming Massively Parallel Processors, CUDA books, Theoretical occupancy of a kernel, Nsight compute` 


- **Holy GPU Book recommended**: One member suggested *Programming Massively Parallel Processors, pmpp, aka holy gpu book* as a beginner friendly book about GPU architecture and programming.
   - However, another member who had already read this book was looking for an alternative.
- **CUDA by example**: One member found **CUDA by example** to be a little gentler and more from a programmer's point of view.
   - Other members suggested rereading existing books instead.
- **Nsight Compute to the rescue**: When figuring out the theoretical occupancy of a kernel, members suggested using **Nsight compute** to get occupancy when you profile.
   - It also includes the occupancy calculator in which you can see how occupancy would change with each occupancy-affecting SM resource and you can play around with the parameters.
- **Dive into CUDA or Dive into Jobs?**: One member asked for advice on whether to dive into **CUDA** programming(**Triton**) to optimize model performance, or to start applying for jobs after implementing the **Attention Is All You Need** paper using **PyTorch**, followed by **nanoGPT**, **GPT-2 (124M)**, and **LLaMA2**.
   - Currently, the member is experimenting with their own **22M-parameter coding model**, which they plan to deploy on **Hugging Face** to further deepen their understanding.

- **Float8 Conv Kernels Quest Begins**: A member suggested that to enable **float8 conv**, a **cuda / TK / triton kernel** is needed, which could be a valuable addition to **torchao**.
   - Another member expressed interest in possibly implementing one.
- **INT8 Conv Dynamic Quantization Costs Disclosed**: A member recalled creating an **INT8 conv** from a **torch inductor template**, noting that while the kernel's performance was satisfactory, the dynamic quantization of activations to INT8 was too costly, negating end-to-end speedup.
   - They suggested that **static quantization** might be necessary, where *scales and zero points for activations are determined ahead of time from calibration data*.

> `FlashAttention Turing, MLA Weight Absorption, MLA CPU Kernel` 


- **FlashAttention Arrives on Turing Architecture**: A developer has implemented the FlashAttention forward pass for the Turing architecture, which was previously limited to Ampere and Hopper, with code available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ssiu/flash-attention-turing).
   - Early benchmarks show a **2x speed improvement** over Pytorch's `F.scaled_dot_product_attention` (using xformers) on a **T4**, under specific conditions: `head_dim = 128`, vanilla attention, and `seq_len` divisible by 128.
- **Deepseek's MLA Implemented with Weight Absorption**: DataCrunch wrote about how to use the weight absorption trick to ensure efficient implementation of **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)**, a key innovation in Deepseek's V3 and R1 models, detailed in [their blog post](https://datacrunch.io/blog/deepseek-sglang-multi-head-latent-attention).
   - According to a member, *vLLM combines 2 matmuls into 1, which consumes more FLOPs and memory accesses*, and found that vLLM's current default was bad, based on [this pull request](https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer/pull/551#issuecomment-2665697147).
- **MLA CPU Kernel Under Construction**: A member coincidentally was also working on MLA today, implementing **MLA CPU kernel**, finding the hard way that vLLM current default was bad, and recommends that it should be called weight reordering instead of absorption.

> `YC Startup Strategy, Maxwell's Demon, Meta-Transform and Adaptive Meta-Learning, LLM Scaling Theory, AI scientist` 


- **YC Prioritizes Short-Term Gains Over Long-Term Viability**: A member claimed that **YC** focuses on startups with short-term success potential, investing **$500K** to potentially **3x** their money in just **6 months**, without necessarily aiming for long-term sustainability.
   - They argued that **YC** hasn't produced a notable unicorn in years, implying a decline in their ability to foster long-term success stories.
- **Maxwell's Demon Limits AI Speed**: According to [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS0JXViv0cU) about Maxwell's demon, the speed of computers is limited by *how fast you run the answer and how certain you run the answer.*
   - The video references the Lex Fridman Podcast featuring Neil Gershenfeld, delving into the relationship between life, thermodynamics, and computation.
- **LLMs Approximate Context-Free Languages**: A theory suggests that **LLM scaling** can be explained by their ability to approximate a context-free language using probabilistic FSAs, resulting in a characteristic S-curve.
   - This [attached image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/986699377257119794/1349416392021119047/20250312_111842.jpg?ex=67d456f2&is=67d30572&hm=2492956c61fb86b79264d1863fb121f787cecf87ab855f65f21439471a6217fb) proposes that LLMs attempt to approximate the language of a higher rung, originating from a lower rung of the Chomsky hierarchy.
- **Lluminate Project Aims to Evolve LLM Outputs**: The [Lluminate project](https://www.joelsimon.net/lluminate) introduces an evolutionary algorithm designed to help LLMs break free from generating predictable and similar outputs.
   - This project combines evolutionary principles with creative thinking strategies to *illuminate the space of possibilities* and counter homogenization.
- **Hardware Hurdles hinder Local LLM**: Members discussed that while cloud AI solutions like **OpenAI** are costly, running a local model requires significant hardware investments, making it a trade-off between subscription fees and equipment expenses.
   - One suggested using **LlamaCPP** to run decent models off a cheap SSD, but noted it would be significantly slower, potentially taking a week for a single paragraph of inference.

> `AST Evaluation, Function Calling Leaderboard, LLM Integration, Parallel Function Calls` 


- ****AST** Evaluates Correctness Thoroughly**: The **AST** (Abstract Syntax Tree) evaluation checks for the correct function call with the correct values, including function name, parameter types, and parameter values within possible ranges, clarified in [the V1 blog](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/8_berkeley_function_calling_leaderboard.html#metrics).
   - The numerical value in the table for **AST** represents the *percentage of test cases* where all these criteria were correct.
- ****BFCL** is a Comprehensive Evaluation**: The **[Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html) (BFCL)**, updated on **2024-08-19** ([Change Log](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/blob/main/berkeley-function-call-leaderboard/CHANGELOG.md)), is the first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to call functions and tools.
   - The leaderboard was built to represent typical user function calling use-cases in agents and enterprise workflows.
- ****LLMs** Power Applications via Function Calling**: Large Language Models (**LLMs**) like **GPT**, **Gemini**, **Llama**, and **Mistral** are increasingly integrated into applications such as **Langchain**, **Llama Index**, **AutoGPT**, and **Voyager** through function calling (also known as tool calling) capabilities.
   - These models demonstrate significant potential in powering various applications and software.
- ****Function Calls** can be Parallel**: The function calls considered in the evaluation include various forms, such as *parallel* (one function input, multiple invocations of the function output) and *multiple* function calls.
   - This comprehensive approach covers common function-calling use-cases.
