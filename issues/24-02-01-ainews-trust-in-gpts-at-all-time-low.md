<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI Discords for 1/31/2024. We checked **21** guilds, **312** channels, and **8530** messages for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **628 minutes**.

It's been about 3 months since GPTs were released and ~a month since the GPT store was launched. But the reviews have been [brutal](https://twitter.com/wangzjeff/status/1752780035491336661):

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/353f9ee8-05cc-41d1-99b0-b48c8fcdbb41.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Nick Dobos (of Grimoire fame) also blasted [the entire knowledge files capability](https://twitter.com/nickadobos/status/1749837866300264529) - it seems the RAG system naively includes 40k characters' worth of context from docs every time, reducing available context and adherence to system prompts.

All pointing towards needing greater visibility for context management in GPTs, which is somewhat at odds with OpenAI's clear no-code approach.

- **Style Transfer or Overfitting?**: `@manojbh` debated about LLMs having responses overly influenced by their training on a particular style like Mistral; pointed out that similar end-layer patterns cause style mimicry in outputs. This was in context to misleading output reasoning and a linked tweet by `@teortaxesTex`, regarding Miqu’s mistake in RU translation with oddly similar phrasing.
- **Quantized Models and Memory Discussio**n: Discussions by `@giftedgummybee` and `@manojbh` centered around quantized models forgetting information and the increased potential for errors with lower quantization levels.
- **AI Stress Test Speculation**: A theory by `@manojbh` on whether LLMs can fumble under stress like humans led to a suggestion by `@_3sphere` to test the model's "panic" behavior in response to confusing prompts.
- **Watermarking within Mistral**: Conversation with `@everyoneisgross`, `@.benxh`, and `.ben.com` delved into the possibility of watermarking LLMs, hypothesizing it could involve distinct Q&A pairs or prompts that generate specific responses as identifiers after quantization.
- **Evaluating Nous-Hermes and Mixtral Performance**: `@.benxh` affirmed a significant performance difference between Mistral Medium and an unspecified model capacity, indicating close performance within the margin of error. `@manojbh` agreed, highlighting the importance of even slight differences in statistical metrics.

- **The Quest for Server-grade GPUs**: `@le_mess` offered connections for purchasing server-grade hardware. In the meanwhile, `@yamashi` contemplated acquisitions, considering a `Gigabyte Server G262-ZO0` setup with AMD EPYC processors and the **AMD MI250** GPUs, weighing the benefits against renting.

- **Software Stack Skepticism**: Although AMD's offerings like the `MI250` intrigued some users for their memory capacity and potential performance, `@yamashi` expressed doubts about the maturity of AMD's software stack compared to Nvidia.

- **Commit Conundrum**: `@nafnlaus00` identified a likely problematic commit (`da97285e63811c17ce1e92b2c32c26c9ed8e2d5d`) in the `axolotl` library that might be causing significant **overtraining** in their model fine-tune. They're undertaking a methodical approach to isolate the change responsible.

- **Tiny YAMLs, Major Leaps**: `@caseus_` shared a small, **11-line YAML** config that can kick off a finetune, mentioning an imminent **refactor** for `axolotl` to further streamline and improve defaults, which might reduce complexity even more ([PR #1239](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl/pull/1239)).

- **Axolotl Installation Stuck on flash-attn**: `@arindam8841` encountered issues installing axolotl related to building the wheel for flash-attn. They resolved the issue by installing the latest version of flash-attn separately using `pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation`.
- **Understanding Batch Size in axolotl**: `@dreamgen` questioned how batch size scales with the number of GPUs in axolotl, while `@caseus_` clarified that using DeepSpeed, specifically zero3, adjusts for distributed data parallel (DDP) and batch sizes, making it unnecessary for models that fit on a single GPU.
- **Dataset Configuration Challenges**: `@jorelosorio` faced errors trying to use the same dataset with different formats for different tasks within axolotl. The issue was resolved by specifying different `data_files` paths for each task.
- **Merging Models with Axolotl**: `@cf0913` experienced an `AttributeError` while attempting to merge QLORA with a base model, seeking advice on whether to use the axolotl command line or another method, with a suggestion from `@le_mess` about full finetuning.
- **Request for Token Counting Script**: Both `@arcontex` expressed a need for a script to count the number of tokens in a file, and `@gonejiggy` offered to write a CLI tool and asked if a pull request would be accepted. `@nanobitz` mentioned that axolotl already outputs token counts in logs and asked for the yaml configuration to further assist `@arcontex`.

- **Jeremy's Notebook Errors Solved**: User `@arsalan6990` encountered an error while trying to follow Jeremy's notebook. Thanks to `@drisspg`, a solution was found by referencing GitHub issues, specifically one involving a mismatch between the CUDA version and the version used to compile PyTorch ([CUDA 12.0 Issue](https://github.com/qwopqwop200/GPTQ-for-LLaMa/issues/7#issuecomment-1465246457)) and a template-related error with CUDA 12.1 ([Cuda 12.1 Template Issue](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/issues/4606#issuecomment-1498131493)). The fix required installing g++ and gcc 11 and ensuring GLIBCXX_3.4.32 was available.
- **Cost-Efficiency Tip for Computing Resources**: `@nshepperd` suggested that having a lot of CPU RAM is beneficial since it is much cheaper than GPU RAM, costing about 1/10 per GB in comparison.
- **C++ Templates Clarification**: In the context of error resolution, `@zippika` explained the use of `typename` in C++ templates, detailing that it is a placeholder for substituted types within template definitions.

- **CUDA Compatibility Confirmation**: `@noobpeen` asked if CUDA 11.8 is fine for use, since it was already installed for deep learning. `@lancerts` confirmed it should be okay, providing a [link to NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-visual-studio-edition/3.2/Content/Debugging_CUDA_Application.htm) which details CUDA Data Stack limitations and functions like `cuCtxGetLimit()` and `cuCtxSetLimit()`.
- **Debugging CUDA in VSCode**: `@andreaskoepf` pointed out that **CUDA Debugging in VSCode** is possible, though the setup process is slightly complex, and shared a [link to the relevant NVIDIA documentation](http://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-visual-studio-code-edition/cuda-debugger/index.html).
- **CUDA Kernel Debugging Inquiry**: `@jeremyhoward` queried about debugging CUDA kernels called from PyTorch, especially through just-in-time (jit) extensions. No direct solutions were provided within these messages.
- **Approach to Kernel Development**: `@andreaskoepf` describes their development process, starting with a PyTorch reference implementation and then creating a custom kernel to pass the `torch.allclose()` test. This was echoed by `@marksaroufim`, who has observed similar practices at PyTorch.
- **Test Framework Preferences**: `@andreaskoepf` expressed a preference for using raw Python files or Jupyter notebooks over pytest during development, citing the added complexity of pytest. `@marksaroufim` humorously noted the satisfaction from seeing passing tests marked by dots and green colors, whereas `@andreaskoepf` joked about getting random patterns of failures (F) and passes (dots) and the occasional pytest crash.

- **CUDA Block Size Matching**: `@lancerts` inquired about the necessity for block size to match `tile_width`, especially when a configuration with block dimensions `dim3(32,32,1)` runs without errors despite `tile_width` being 16. `@vim410` warned that while no immediate errors may be observable, without bounds checking, one could run into illegal memory errors, and stated that aligning more threads than needed for the work is generally illogical.
- **Understanding Thread Coarsening in CUDA**: `@lancerts` sought clarification on thread coarsening code specifics, questioning the appropriate dimensions for `threadsPerBlock` and `numBlocks`. The inquiry contrasts a coarsened version with a normal tiled version that uses rectangular thread block shapes, illustrating a common confusion among developers when it comes to optimizing thread allocation in CUDA programming.
