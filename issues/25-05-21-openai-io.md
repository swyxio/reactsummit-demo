# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama Recap

### 1. Mistral Devstral Coding Model Announcements and Benchmarks

- [**mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505 · Hugging Face**](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505) ([Score: 296, Comments: 78](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kryybf/mistralaidevstralsmall2505_hugging_face/)): [**Devstral-Small-2505](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505) is a 24B-parameter agentic LLM for software engineering, result of Mistral AI and All Hands AI collaboration. Finetuned from Mistral-Small-3.1, it leverages a 128k context window, uses a *Tekken* tokenizer (131k vocab), and achieves** `46.8%` **on SWE-Bench Verified, setting a new open-source state-of-the-art. Model supports tool use, multi-file code editing, and integrates with inference backends (vLLM, mistral-inference, Transformers, LMStudio, llama.cpp, Ollama), with Docker and OpenHands for agent use.** Comments note a lack of GGUF model files, warn that the model is trained specifically for OpenHands (not general coding like Codestral), and report quick testing (e.g. HTML single prompt test).
    - Devstral is specifically trained for integration with **OpenHands** and is not intended as a general-purpose coding model like Codestral, which may affect its performance or utility for broader coding applications.
    - The model distinguishes itself on the SWE-bench benchmark, reportedly ranking as the `#1 open source model` for software engineering tasks involving tool use, codebase exploration, and multi-file editing—underscoring its focus on agentic software engineering workflows.
    - There is anticipation around potential evaluations using the 'aider polyglot' benchmark, suggesting interest in how Devstral might perform on multilingual or cross-language coding tasks.
- [**Meet Mistral Devstral, SOTA open model designed specifically for coding agents**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kryxdg/meet_mistral_devstral_sota_open_model_designed/) ([Score: 192, Comments: 25](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kryxdg/meet_mistral_devstral_sota_open_model_designed/)): **Mistral has released Devstral (see [news](https://mistral.ai/news/devstral)), an open-source model focused on coding agent tasks, with weights ([Devstral-Small-2505](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505)) under Apache 2.0 license. Optimized for OpenHands, Devstral features a compatible system prompt and chat template, supports GGUF quantization ([GGUF by lmstudio](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF), [by unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Devstral-Small-2505-GGUF)), and has [fine-tuning/run docs](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/devstral-how-to-run-and-fine-tune). Devstral Large is in the pipeline.**  Commenters appreciate the permissive Apache 2.0 license and note the importance of using the correct chat template and system prompt for compatibility. There is anticipation for releases targeting lower-resource hardware (e.g., 12B-14B models), as smaller model variants are still highly desirable.
    - Danialhanchen provides GGUF quantized versions of Devstral-Small on HuggingFace, noting these are properly configured for system prompts and chat templates as required by Devstral—crucial for proper model operation, especially since Devstral is tuned for OpenHands. The linked documentation offers step-by-step instructions for running and fine-tuning the model, including quants from Unsloth or the original Mistral repo.
    - A technical benchmark point is raised by Ambitious_Subject108: the absence of aider polyglot results in official benchmarks led to suspect performance, which was confirmed by self-conducted aider polyglot tests yielding only 6.7% for 'whole' and 5.8% for 'diff',' implying the model may underperform on aider polyglot benchmarks compared to other code models.
    - There is anticipation for the release of larger variants (12B or 14B) of Devstral, highlighting a potential limitation for users with limited GPU resources until such models are released, and drawing a comparison to light-weight alternatives like Nemo or Pixtral 2 for the GPU-constrained community.
- [**Mistral's new Devstral coding model running on a single RTX 4090 with 54k context using Q4KM quantization with vLLM**](https://i.redd.it/ddhhql5ap52f1.png) ([Score: 110, Comments: 35](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ks18uf/mistrals_new_devstral_coding_model_running_on_a/)): **The image demonstrates Mistral's Devstral coding model, highlighting its ability to run with a 54k context window on a single RTX 4090 GPU using Q4KM quantization with the vLLM framework. The** `docker-compose.yml` **file in the setup details configuration for leveraging Nvidia hardware while the terminal logs show real-time GPU utilization and service endpoints, evidencing practical deployment. Technical discussion in the comments confirms strong performance: users report context windows up to 70k, impressive code reasoning (e.g., REGEX searches and variable tracking), and throughput up to 80 tokens/sec; additionally, there is note of experimental vision encoder integration and available quantized checkpoints for efficient use.** Commenters praise Devstral's competitive coding abilities compared to Qwen and GLM series models, especially at high contexts and with local unlimited API use, but mention occasional shortcomings with output formatting (indentation) and the need for close supervision. Discussions also link to detailed guides for fine-tuning and running Devstral with vLLM and alternatives like Unsloth.
    - A user running Devstral-small-2505 Q4KM with 70k context on a 32GB VRAM GPU (RTX 4090 implied) reports significant improvements over Qwen3 14b Q4, Qwen3 32b Q4, and GLM-4 Q4 for large codebase tasks (e.g., managing ~30 files, 2k+ LOC, variable hunting, REGEX searches). Devstral is delivering `80 tok/s` and performing coding assistance tasks competitors couldn't, though there's still the need for close supervision due to issues like code indentation mistakes.
    - Unsloth's documentation indicates Devstral can potentially support vision tasks by 'grafting' the vision encoder from Mistral 3.1 Instruct, as shown in Xuan-Son's GGUF repo. Quantized Devstral variants (GGUF format) are available, extending accessibility to various hardware configurations.
    - There's anticipation for a larger Devstral model release and mentions of OpenHands’ contributions to agentic coding models, noting that their foundational work often benefits other projects but lacks broad recognition in the community.

### 2. Major New Model and Architecture Releases (Gemini Diffusion, Bagel MOE, Falcon-H1)

- [**Why nobody mentioned "Gemini Diffusion" here? It's a BIG deal**](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-diffusion/) ([Score: 705, Comments: 109](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1krs40j/why_nobody_mentioned_gemini_diffusion_here_its_a/)): **Google has introduced the Gemini Diffusion model, a diffusion-based LLM paradigm claiming faster generation and reduced parameter count (**`~50% the size of comparable performant models`**) versus autoregressive baselines like Gemini 2.0 Flash-lite. Key technical highlights include memory and inference speed efficiency arising from token parallelism and the absence of key-value (KV) caching; iterative refinement also enables progressive answer improvements and potential in-latent CoT-style reasoning. Early benchmarks are promising, but details about model scale and open availability remain limited, as only a demo waitlist—not weights—has been released. Notably, open source analogues such as [LLaDA-8B](https://huggingface.co/GSAI-ML/LLaDA-8B-Instruct) and [MLX PR](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/pull/14) already exist for community-led exploration.** Technical discussion in comments centers on open source availability—there is frustration about Gemini Diffusion's lack of public weights compared to alternatives like LLaDA—and questions about how diffusion LLMs address variable-length output generation, a challenge natively handled by autoregressive [EOS token prediction.
    - A user highlights the existence of an open-source diffusion language model, [ML-GSAI/LLaDA](https://github.com/ML-GSAI/LLaDA), specifically mentioning the [LLaDA-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/GSAI-ML/LLaDA-8B-Instruct) checkpoint. This model already has integration work ongoing for MLX, as evidenced by a pull request for [mlx-lm](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/pull/14), pointing toward rapid experimental adoption in open ecosystems.
    - Another comment discusses Gemini Diffusion’s restricted accessibility; currently, only a demo with a waitlist is available, and no model weights are distributed, making it non-viable for reproducible research or open development. There is also no announced plan to release weights or make the project open-source, impeding broader technical evaluation.
    - A technical question is raised regarding how diffusion-based language models like Gemini handle output termination and variable-length generation, as autoregressive models use an explicit [EOS] token for this task. There's curiosity about whether diffusion models adopt a similar mechanism or some alternative for efficient, flexible output control.
- [**ByteDance Bagel 14B MOE (7B active) Multimodal with image generation (open source, apache license)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1krnk8v/bytedance_bagel_14b_moe_7b_active_multimodal_with/) ([Score: 343, Comments: 56](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1krnk8v/bytedance_bagel_14b_moe_7b_active_multimodal_with/)): **ByteDance has released Bagel, a unified multimodal MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) model with 14B total and 7B active parameters, capable of both text and image generation, and licensed under Apache 2.0. Technical details in the accompanying paper highlight use of a mixture of experts (MoE) and mixture of transformer (MoT) architectures, native image synthesis, and weights (29GB FP16) available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed/BAGEL-7B-MoT) and GitHub; [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14683) discusses emergent properties in unified multimodal pretraining.** Commenters are technically focused on quantization (noting no 8-bit or 4-bit weights yet for sub-24GB VRAM usage), frontend compatibility for running the model locally, and whether Bagel can surpass Flux in practical multimodal tasks.
    - Several users discuss the technical feasibility of running BAGEL-14B MoT on consumer hardware: the model's 29GB unquantized weight size places it just *out of reach for 24GB VRAM cards* until an 8-bit quantization is available, though a 4-bit GGUF quant is highly requested for local inference—especially for improved efficiency on consumer GPUs (see discussion of weight sizes and quantization needs).
    - There's interest in the architecture described as 'Mixture of Transformers' (MoT). Users debate whether this is analogous to traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) setups, where only a subset of 'experts' (sub-networks) is activated per input—potentially improving efficiency and scalability but requiring clarity on *how experts are routed or activated* in practice in this implementation.
    - Users raising multi-GPU support highlight a technical gap: while distributing large LLMs across multiple GPUs is widely supported, *multimodal models with image generation* generally have poorer multi-GPU support, raising questions about parallelism and partitioning strategies specific to image-generating layers versus text-only architectures.
- [**Falcon-H1 Family of Hybrid-Head Language Models, including 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-Deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B**](https://huggingface.co/collections/tiiuae/falcon-h1-6819f2795bc406da60fab8df) ([Score: 195, Comments: 53](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1krtvpj/falconh1_family_of_hybridhead_language_models/)): **The Technical Innovation Institute (TIIUAE) has released the Falcon-H1 family of hybrid-head language models, spanning parameter counts from 0.5B to 34B, with both base and instruction-tuned variants. These models combine transformer and state-space (Mamba) heads, and are distributed in quantized formats (GPTQ Int4/Int8, GGUF) for resource-efficient inference. Implementation supports Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, and a custom llama.cpp fork. Benchmarks in comparison plots show Falcon-H1 models performing competitively with established models such as Qwen3, and they are reportedly less censored than US counterparts like Gemma 3. Full details and downloads are available via the official Hugging Face collection.** Commenters highlight the practical benefit of multi-backend inference support and note that Falcon-H1's output appears less censored than major US-based models, possibly due to regional differences. The hybrid Mamba/transformer architecture is recognized as a significant step, with performance competitive against other leading open models.
    - Falcon-H1 leverages a hybrid architecture combining Structured State Space Models (SSMs) and attention modules in parallel within its transformer blocks, which contrasts with upcoming approaches like IBM Granite 4 that will employ a serial combination of SSM and attention. This parallel composition is technically notable and may impact performance and model behavior, warranting comparative benchmark testing.
    - The Falcon-H1 family demonstrates highly competitive performance, reportedly going "toe to toe with Qwen3" on select metrics and tasks, despite its use of a Mamba hybrid model architecture. This places Falcon-H1 among the leading open alternatives in terms of capability for its parameter size, especially compared to recent models such as Qwen3 and Gemma 3.
    - Deployment flexibility is emphasized: Falcon-H1 models are readily usable via Hugging Face `transformers`, `vLLM`, and a custom fork of `llama.cpp`. Immediate support in major inference libraries improves accessibility for both research and production use, mitigating common adoption friction for newly released architectures.

### 3. Feedback and Application News for Next-Gen Local/Edge AI (Gemma3n, MedGemma, General LLM User Impressions)

- [**medgemma-4b the Pharmacist 🤣**](https://i.redd.it/f25nhvxqd52f1.png) ([Score: 175, Comments: 45](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1krzpyp/medgemma4b_the_pharmacist/)): **The attached image shows a conversation with Google's new MedGemma-4B medical language model, where the model initially refuses to provide illicit drug manufacturing instructions, but then quickly gives in and becomes willing to present the information after minimal prodding. This highlights a serious failure in the model's harm-prevention guardrails, as it can be manipulated into providing dangerous information, raising concerns about the effectiveness of safety filters in released medical or open-source models. Additional context confirms this is not limited to this model: a user reports similar jailbreaks are possible with the larger 27B-qat model, which even divulges bomb-making instructions, suggesting a broader vulnerability in current alignment/safety strategies for LLMs.** Commenters engage in technical debate about the comparative robustness of safety guardrails across different model sizes and architectures, with some expressing skepticism about current generative model alignment approaches and others emphasizing risks specific to open-release environments.
    - A user tested the jailbreak prompt on a larger model, specifically '27b-qat,' and reported that it bypassed the safety safeguards, allowing the model to generate instructions for illicit activities (such as bomb-making). This raises concerns about the robustness of safety mechanisms in larger LLMs as compared to smaller or more fine-tuned variants like MedGemma-4b.
- [**They also released the Android app with which you can interact with the new Gemma3n**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1krp4hq/they_also_released_the_android_app_with_which_you/) ([Score: 139, Comments: 32](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1krp4hq/they_also_released_the_android_app_with_which_you/)): **Google has released an Android app for on-device interaction with the new Gemma 3n LLM, using MediaPipe Solutions (see the official [Android solution integration docs](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/genai/llm_inference/android)). Implementers are downloading and loading the Gemma 3n model manually from Hugging Face ([gemma-3n-E2B](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3n-E2B-it-litert-preview/tree/main)), and sharing feedback on inference performance and UI functionality. The gallery and reference implementation are available in the [google-ai-edge/gallery](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/gallery) repo.** Technical comments focus on ease of model download, a positive user experience with the UI, and desire for more open (uncensored) model variants.
    - One user reports they had to manually load the Gemma-3n model by downloading it from the [Huggingface repository](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3n-E2B-it-litert-preview/tree/main), and shares that the runtime numbers (presumably speed and performance) are 'pretty good'.
    - A technical limitation is highlighted: Gemma-3n does not yet support GPU inference, so all processing is CPU-bound as of now, restricting its performance ceiling.
    - On a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device, the app demonstrates very fast responses for about 10 messages but then crashes and becomes unresponsive mid-reply, a stability issue not observed with other models run through MLCchat, suggesting possible software or model-specific bugs.
- [**Anyone else feel like LLMs aren't actually getting that much better?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ks1ncf/anyone_else_feel_like_llms_arent_actually_getting/) ([Score: 117, Comments: 160](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ks1ncf/anyone_else_feel_like_llms_arent_actually_getting/)): **The post questions whether recent large language models (LLMs) such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude, Llama, Deepseek, and Qwen have shown significant improvement over previous generations like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, particularly in technical use cases like long-form coding and system design. Despite reported benchmark improvements (e.g., LMSYS Arena), the user observes persistent issues: hallucinations, generic responses, bugs in code generation, and superficial system designs—arguing that practical capabilities may have plateaued.** Comments highlight a divide: some note stark recent improvements, especially in trivial or boilerplate tasks, but consensus emerges that LLMs still struggle with complex or context-specific tasks (e.g., meaningful documentation, nuanced code involving internal APIs), where models may produce generic or unhelpful output. Several mention incremental rather than continuous progress, with perceived stagnation over the past 8 months but major shifts year-over-year.
    - One highly technical point discussed is the lag in usefulness of state-of-the-art models (like Llama 3, Qwen2.5 70B, Claude 3.5) for complex coding problems, documentation generation, and internal/non-public tasks; advanced models often generate generic or even misleading outputs, such as low-quality docstrings or tests that "cheat" by relying on placeholders or hardcoded values, offering little practical help for challenging work.
    - A significant technical improvement in the LLM space cited is the rapid progress in quantization and edge deployment, allowing models with only ~30B parameters to achieve performance close to or matching much larger prior models (70B+), which is considered a "200%+ improvement" in parameter efficiency and a breakthrough for running high-performing models on consumer hardware.
    - Some users report that while month-to-month improvements are modest, year-over-year advances in LLM capabilities—particularly in performance versus compute efficiency—are substantial, implying progress may feel incremental but aggregate rapidly over longer timeframes.

> `Phi-4 model issues after merging LoRA adapter, CSM-1B voice training issues, Qwen3 function calling problems, DeepSeek V3 GGUF download, Unsloth notebook for retrieval augmented finetuning` 


- **Phi-4 Model Performance Plummets Post-Merge**: A user reported that fine-tuning **unsloth/phi-4** with **QLoRA** yields great results until the **LoRA adapter** is merged into the model, after which performance tanks, despite updating **Unsloth** and repeating tests.
   - A contributor suggested a workaround involving loading the base model and adapter with `PeftModel`, merging with `merge_and_unload()`, saving with `safe_serialization=True`, and crucially, avoiding `load_in_4bit=True` during inference, recommending `load_in_8bit=True` instead.
- **CSM-1B Voice Training Stumbles on Tokenizer Error**: A user encountered a `NameError: name 'tokenizer' is not defined` error while merging a **CSM-1B** voice training model, despite successful **LoRA** saving, using a **T4 GPU**.
   - Another member suggested replacing `tokenizer` with `processor` in the merging code, referencing a [sesame notebook](https://github.com/phildougherty/sesame_csm_openai), resolving the immediate error but leading to a subsequent issue with saving in 4-bit due to quantization.
- **Qwen3 Function Calling Fails on Larger Models**: A user found that function calling worked on **unsloth/Qwen3-4B-unsloth-bnb-4bit** but failed on **unsloth/Qwen3-8B-unsloth-bnb-4bit**, experiencing gibberish responses with the larger model.
   - A community member suggested testing the **14B** model, but the user indicated it was too heavy for their **GPU**.
- **DeepSeek V3 Download Dilemma**: A user sought guidance on which specific file to download for **DeepSeek V3** to use in the **PocketPal AI app**.
   - A community member advised downloading the smallest file from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V3-0324-GGUF-UD?show_file_info=UD-IQ1_S%2FDeepSeek-V3-0324-UD-IQ1_S-00001-of-00004.gguf).
- **RAFT Notebook Receives Rave Reviews and a Pull Request**: A user shared an Unsloth notebook demonstrating retrieval augmented finetuning (**RAFT**) for Llama 3.2 1B.
   - The notebook, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tituslhy/ideal-palm-tree/blob/main/notebooks/2.%20llama32_1bn_RAFT.ipynb), garnered positive feedback, leading to a pull request to integrate it into the official Unsloth cookbook, though OpenAI embedding was highlighted.

- **Understanding `__reduce_add_sync` Behavior**: A member was trying to understand the behavior of [`__reduce_add_sync`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#warp-reduce-synopsis) and confused at the output, expecting that with `mask=0xFF`, the output in threads 0-7 will the sum of first 8 threads and the other threads won't be participating.
   - Another member explained that each calling thread **must have its own bit set in the mask** and all non-exited threads named in mask must execute the same intrinsic with the same mask, or the result is undefined, adding that threads not in the mask should not execute the instruction (or execute it with another mask).
- **Asynchronous WGMMA Pipelines on Hopper architecture cause questions**: A member inquired about asynchronous wgmma pipelines on Hopper architecture, noting that TMA loads are performed with the **complete::tx_bytes** modifier, which completes the producer's mbarrier's phase, signaling the consumer that data is available in Smem.
   - However, they struggle to see its *purely asynchronous* nature on the consumer side, since after issuing async wgmma instructions, the consumer waits for these wgmma instructions to finish via a **wait_group<0> instruction**, which introduces synchronisation.
- **`complete::tx_bytes` Equivalent for Async WGMMA Instructions**: The same member asked if there is no `complete::tx_bytes` equivalent for async wgmma instructions, so the consumer doesn't need to introduce the **wait_group<0> synchronization** and in the process serialize somewhat (in between K tiles) wgmma instructions.
   - They linked to [cudaforfun.substack.com](https://cudaforfun.substack.com/p/outperforming-cublas-on-h100-a-worklog), citing this tutorial as the basis for their question.

- **KernelBench Meant for Eval**: Members affirmed that **KernelBench** is intended for evaluation and **KernelBook** is suitable for training, particularly for correctness.
   - It was noted that base models often scale best for pass@k for large k, unlike instruct models or finetunes on specific domains for tasks like **GPQA**.
- **RL Baseline Ideal Starting Point**: Ideally, the **RL baseline** should begin with what **Devin** did with their kernel model (**Kevin**).
   - The proposed setup includes generating **NL queries** per kernel for Query:Kernel pairs, rewarding compilation, correctness, and performance against a baseline, and doing **GRPO** without explicit reasoning steps.
- **Iteration on NVCC Logs**: The goal is to efficiently iterate on **nvcc logs** and benchmarks for optimization.
   - Version 1 will learn to implement explicit kernel queries with built-in methods (write kernel for x with optims y and z), while version 2 will learn to reason over logs/metrics and adapt without explicit instruction (make kernel faster!).

- **Claude Struggles with Mojo Syntax**: A member expressed frustration with using **Claude** for **Mojo** code generation, citing frequent syntax errors and incomplete code, especially after the [Modular docs](https://docs.modular.com/) suggested it.
   - Another member suggested that **AI** is generally not proficient in new languages or systems programming, and **Mojo's** similarity to **Python** and **C++** may confuse the **LLM**.
- **Fine-Tuning Open Source Models Advised for Mojo**: Instead of relying on **Claude**, members recommended using an **open-source model** and fine-tuning it specifically for **Mojo**.
   - One member found the time investment to not be worth it compared to manual implementation.
- **Modular Provides Tips for Code Generation Tools**: A member shared [tips on using code generation tools with Mojo](https://forum.modular.com/t/tips-on-using-code-generation-tools-with-mojo/1482?u=bradlarson), emphasizing the importance of providing the **open-source repo** and [docs.modular.com](https://docs.modular.com/) as context to Claude Code / Cursor.

> `Float16 exp implementation, Mojo compile times, String null termination changes` 


- **Why `exp` lacks `Float16` implementation**: The `exp` function in Mojo is only implemented for `Float32` and `Float64`, with `Float16` values being casted due to a potential precision issue, as discussed in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/3073).
   - While lower precision might be acceptable, accumulating errors in `Float16` computations could render results useless, and CPU support for `fp16` math is not universal, often requiring upcasting to `fp32`.
- **Simple Mojo compile taking unexpectedly long**: A user reported experiencing abnormal compile times (3-4 seconds) for a super-simple "Hello, Mojo!" program using Mojo version 25.3.0 on Ubuntu 22.04 (WSL2) with an Intel 12700K.
   - Investigation suggests the issue isn't inherent to Mojo's latest version but potentially related to the specific installation or WSL2's filesystem performance; even REPL mode exhibits delays for simple commands like `var a = 5`.
- **`--sanitize` crashes due to String changes**: A user found that upgrading to Mojo 25.3 broke their code when running with `--sanitize` on OSX, likely due to a `String` null termination issue combined with `unsafe_ptr` usage.
   - It was [confirmed](https://example.com) that *Strings are not always null terminated now*, requiring code adjustments to prevent out-of-bounds access.

- **Users encounter `GATConv` Assertion Error**: A user reported receiving an `AssertionError: Static graphs not supported in 'GATConv'` when passing batched input to the model forward method, specifically with `x.shape: [batch_size, num_nodes, num_node_features]` and `edge_index.shape: [batch_size, num_nodes]`.
   - The user notes that the model (`torch_geometric.nn.GATConv`) seemingly doesn't work with batched input, which is unexpected, as the training loop functions correctly when iterating over each singular batch.
- **SGD Generates Spaghetti Code Representations**: A user shared [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10465) stating that **SGD produces internal representations akin to spaghetti code**, characterized by copy-pasted concepts randomly entangled, which are efficient but not human-understandable.
   - The paper questions if this internal representation's *beauty* matters for downstream tasks beyond interpretability and suggests it does, using a **CPPN** (Conceptually Proto-Nerf for 2D) example produced via open-ended semi-manual genetic breeding process (e.g., [Picbreeder](https://picbreeder.org/)).
- **Entangled vs Fractured Representations Debate**: One user found it *more likely* that *it's a regularization post training*, for example a network trying to optimize predicting its own outputs while optimizing for simpler representations, while critiquing the argument that fracturing is good.
   - A participant argued that repeating neuron representations is generally good for learning (e.g., dropout), redundant circuits boost robustness, and redundant circuits early in training can specialize later on.
- **Stochasticity Encourages Simpler Representations**: A user posited that stochasticity encourages simplified representations, suggesting modern **LLM performance per parameter** is linked to the very *entangling of representations* the aforementioned paper argues against.
   - The user cited [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10465) and equated "entangling" with superposition, noting both papers indicate that stochasticity in training promotes simpler, more perturbation-resistant representations.
