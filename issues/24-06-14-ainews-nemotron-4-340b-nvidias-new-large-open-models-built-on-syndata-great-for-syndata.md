  **NVIDIA** has scaled up its **Nemotron-4** model from **15B** to a massive
  **340B** dense model, trained on **9T tokens**, achieving performance
  comparable to **GPT-4**. The model alignment process uses over **98% synthetic
  data**, with only about **20K human-annotated samples** for fine-tuning and
  reward model training. The synthetic data generation pipeline is open-sourced,
  including synthetic prompts and preference data generation. The base and
  instruct versions outperform **Mixtral** and **Llama 3**, while the reward
  model ranks better than **Gemini 1.5**, **Cohere**, and **GPT-4o**. Other
  notable models include **Mamba-2-Hybrid 8B**, which is up to **8x faster**
  than Transformers and excels on long-context tasks, **Samba-3.8B-instruct**
  for infinite context length with linear complexity, **Dolphin-2.9.3** tiny
  models optimized for low-resource devices, and **Faro Yi 9B DPO** with a
  **200K context window** running efficiently on **16GB VRAM**. The
  Mixture-of-Agents technique boosts open-source LLMs beyond GPT-4 Omni on
  AlpacaEval 2.0.

NVIDIA has completed scaling up [Nemotron-4 15B released in Feb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16819), to a whopping 340B dense model. [Philipp Schmid has the best bullet point details you need to know](https://x.com/_philschmid/status/1801651752426524996):

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/726a2bf3-47dd-47f4-ba30-a66904bd0e02.png?w=960&fit=max) 

From [NVIDIA blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nemotron-4-synthetic-data-generation-llm-training/), [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-4-340b-666b7ebaf1b3867caf2f1911), [Technical Report](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2024-06_nemotron-4-340b), [Bryan Catanzaro](https://x.com/ctnzr/status/1801645786138321251?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [Oleksii Kuchaiev](https://x.com/kuchaev/status/1801650219739976023). 

The synthetic data pipeline is worth further study:

> Notably, over 98% of data used in our model alignment process is synthetically generated, showcasing the effectiveness of these models in generating synthetic data. To further support open research and facilitate model development, **we are also open-sourcing the synthetic data generation pipeline used in our model alignment process**.

and

> Notably, throughout the entire alignment process, we relied
on only approximately 20K human-annotated data (10K for supervised fine-tuning, 10K Helpsteer2 data for
reward model training and preference fine-tuning), while our data generation pipeline synthesized over 98%
of the data used for supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning.

Section 3.2 in [the paper](https://d1qx31qr3h6wln.cloudfront.net/publications/Nemotron_4_340B_8T.pdf) provides lots of delicious detail on the pipeline:

- Synthetic single-turn prompts
- Synthetic instruction-following prompts
- Synthetic two-turn prompts
- Synthetic Dialogue Generation
- Synthetic Preference Data Generation


The [base and instruct models easily beat Mixtral and Llama 3](https://x.com/ctnzr/status/1801645787258229020), but perhaps that is not surprising for half an order of magnitude larger params. However they also release a [Reward Model](https://x.com/ctnzr/status/1801645790840135886) version that ranks better than Gemini 1.5, Cohere, and GPT 4o. The detail disclosure is interesting:

- **Live code review session proposed**: *"Would it help to meet this weekend and do a live code review and merge of the PR?"* Members expressed confusion over current progress, suggesting a live session could clear things up.

- **7x as a clear performance target**: A performance target of **7x** speedup is discussed, with analysis indicating it's achievable for large input shapes. Actual performance varies, *"on average 5-6x for large matrices, 2-4x for smaller matrices."*

- **Performance fluctuation and analysis link shared**: Mobicham shared that the max performance was around **7x** but averaged **5-6x** on large matrices and **2-4x** on smaller ones. For batch-size=1 with **int8 activations**, an 8x improvement was noted on A100 GPUs, with supporting benchmark images from [BitBLAS](https://github.com/microsoft/BitBLAS/raw/main/images/figures/op_benchmark_a100_wq_gemv_e8.png).

- **Batch size impacts performance**: Discussion highlighted that performance, *"quickly loses the speed with larger batch-sizes,"* confirming it is especially efficient for single batch processes. Larger batch sizes reduce memory-bound constraints and diminish speed gains, as supported by additional benchmarks: [BitBLAS scaling](https://github.com/microsoft/BitBLAS/raw/main/images/figures/op_benchmark_a100_int2_scaling.png).

- **Technical details of tensor cores and performance**: Queries were made about whether tensor cores (INT8 vs FP16/BF16) were used in specific instances, particularly with **Wint2 x Aint8** setups. Mobicham noted a 4x speed-up with **int8 x int8** without using `wmma`, which requires 16x16 blocks and is likely suboptimal for small batch sizes.

This development could reshape AI databases by offering superior performance at a fraction of the cost.
- **DreamSync aligns text-to-image without human rating**: [DreamSync](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1881v4u/dreamsync_aligning_texttoimage_generation_with/), a new approach to align text-to-image generation models, leverages image understanding feedback without human rating. This method seeks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of text-to-image models significantly.

- **Choosing models between 7-10b parameters**: A member highlighted that *the choice of models in the 7-10b range depends on the specific use case*. For tasks requiring correct German grammar, **discolm or occiglot models** are better despite what benchmarks indicate.

- **Managing trade-offs with further training**: The same member suggested that *trade-offs between non-English language quality and reasoning/instruction following* can be managed through further training or merging. However, with larger parameter models (50-72b range), **this trade-off problem dissolves**, albeit inference may get slower.
  
- **Resource considerations**: Due to the slow inference speed of large models, they recommended *staying with VRAM fitting q4/q6 for efficiency*. A link was shared for reference: [Spaetzle collection on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/cstr/spaetzle-661e758857b1fa96731c43bc).
