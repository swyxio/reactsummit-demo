<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 3/21/2024-3/25/2024. We checked [**364** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **22** Discords (**342** channels, and **12281** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **1173 minutes**.

[Andrew Ng's The Batch writeup on Agents](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1bl3s9r/andrew_ng_cofounder_of_google_brain_former_chief/?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email) made a splash across all platforms this weekend:

> Devin’s splashy demo recently received a lot of social media buzz. My team has been closely following the evolution of AI that writes code. We analyzed results from a number of research teams, focusing on an algorithm’s ability to do well on the widely used HumanEval coding benchmark. You can see our findings in the diagram below. 
>
> GPT-3.5 (zero shot) was 48.1% correct. GPT-4 (zero shot) does better at 67.0%. However, the improvement from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 is dwarfed by incorporating an iterative agent workflow. Indeed, wrapped in an agent loop, GPT-3.5 achieves up to 95.1%.

- **Exploring Metrics in SFTTrainer**: A user seeks advice on using a generation-based metric for validation with `SFTTrainer`, referencing a workaround in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/issues/862#issuecomment-1896074498). They are unclear about the preds received in the `compute_metrics` function and how `SFTTrainer` computes loss when fine-tuning with LoRA adapters.

- **Chatbot Model Inference Hardware Requirements**: A user asks how to determine hardware requirements for running LLM models like [Nous-Capybara-34B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Capybara-34B-GGUF), and another user suggests referring to another HH model's [discussion](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/CodeLlama-34B-Instruct-GGUF/discussions/2) for estimates, clarifying that model requirements can vary based on quantization and prompt.

- **Model Differences & Quantization**: Inquiry made about the differences between two versions of *Mistral* models leads to an explanation that 4-bit models like [here](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/mistral-7b-v0.2-bnb-4bit) are faster to download but suffer a slight drop in accuracy.

- **Mistral and Their Marketing Strategy**: Discussion unfolds around Mistral's model release practices which are deemed unusual by a member due to not uploading their base models on Hugging Face and the unconventional leaking incident on 4chan.

- **Debate on Computer Science Education**: A heated discussion takes place on the importance of a Computer Science degree in light of LLMs now capable of writing code. The conversation veers into various programming languages, memory safety, and the value of degrees from different universities.

- **Understanding Unsloth's Fast Dequantizing**: Unsloth AI's 'fast_dequantize' in `fast_lora.py` is noted to be optimized for speed with reduced memory copies compared to `bitsandbytes`.
- **Troubleshooting and Updating Mistral with Unsloth**: A member was advised to upgrade Unsloth due to issues with Gemma GGUF, with a command provided for the upgrade. It was noted that problems existed not only with GGUF but also with merging.
- **Resolving Inference Issue with Looping Tokens**: Discussion on a reported issue where models converted to gguf, particularly using Mistral, started repeating `<s>` in a loop during responses. Unsloth's maintainer suggests checking the `tokenizer.eos_token`.
- **Combining Multiple Datasets for Fine-Tuning**: It's suggested that multiple datasets can be concatenated into one text string, processed, and then appended together for training. Enhanced instructions and responses from different datasets can potentially be merged for this purpose.
- **Needing Clarity on Fine-Tuning Parameters**: Queries were made about controlling epochs with `max_steps` during fine-tuning, for which setting `num_train_epochs` instead was recommended. Additionally, it's mentioned higher memory consumption may result from increasing `max_seq_length` due to padding.

- **Distributed AI - A Networked Dream or Practical Scheme?**: An extended discussion took place regarding the feasibility of networked machines running language models collaboratively, akin to a mini-distributed computing environment. There was skepticism about the practicability due to latency and bandwidth constraints, but examples like HyperspaceAI's approach and methods such as DHT (distributed hash table) were cited for potential inspiration.

- **VRAM Large and in Charge**: Price and performance comparisons between high VRAM GPUs such as the RTX 3090 with its 24GB of VRAM were discussed for running AI models. There was a general consensus that, for the purpose of local machine learning, GPUs like the RTX 3090 offer the best value for VRAM capacity.

- **New Horizons in Local Compute**: The conversation touched on the prospects of LLMs (large language models) shifting computing demands back to local infrastructure much like the Linux/LAMP movement of the '90s. The parallel was made between the potential growth in LLM development and deployment and past tech revolutions that demanded significant grassroots technical expertise.

- **Macs and Memory - Apple's Big VRAM Offer**: Speculation around the RAM capacity of future Mac models, specifically the M3 Ultra Studio, was discussed with expectations it might allow for at least 256GB (V)RAM. Current models like the M3 and M2 Ultra Mac Studio were highlighted for their substantial combined system and GPU RAM, capable of performing high VRAM computations.

- **Hybrid GPU Setups - The Plot Thickens**: An attempted setup with an AMD 7800XT and NVIDIA 3060 in the same PC resulted in initialization errors with LM Studio software, prompting a conversation about the challenges of running a Frankenstein build. The broader implications of how to approach building rigs with multiple high VRAM GPUs for running large AI models were also touched upon.

**LM Studio ▷ #[open-interpreter](https://discord.com/channels/1110598183144399058/1197707651438624849/1220968798946066463)** (23 messages🔥): 

- **Troubleshooting Interpreter Connection Issues**: A user faced an error with a local *Mistral model* stating "**Model with key 'gpt-4' not loaded**." After some back-and-forth discussion, making a simple `curl` request to the server fixed the issue, but the cause remained unclear.
- **Local LLM Recommendations for Open-interpreter**: Users discussed various LLM options for use with Open-interpreter: **CodeLlama 7B Instruct - GGUF** gave correct answers for sample questions, while **Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 - GGUF** underperformed. Another recommendation was for **Truthful_DPO_TomGrc_FusionNet_7Bx2_MoE_13B-GGUF**, which was noted for verbosity.
- **Unboxing Open Interpreter's Hype**: Users shared views on a YouTube promotional video for Open Interpreter, with one user unable to order due to location constraints. Another shared that printing the device oneself is possible, with STL files available for free on [01.openinterpreter.com/bodies/01-light](https://01.openinterpreter.com/bodies/01-light).
- **Exploring GGUF-Compatible Models**: Users provided links to various models on Hugging Face, including CodeLlama 7B Instruct and Mistral 7B Instruct, formatted in GGUF, discussing their performance when tested with Open-interpreter.
- **Handling Non-Blessed Model Errors**: A user resolved errors encountered with non-blessed models by modifying the default system message, linking to issue [#1124 on open-interpreter's GitHub](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter/issues/1124).

- **European Data Laws Hinder LAION's Potential**: A discussion highlighted that datasets from LAION may be less effective than their US counterparts due to stringent EU regulations. It was suggested that until the EU relaxes its data laws, reliance on synthetic data and collaborations with less restrictive jurisdictions will be necessary, a process humorously termed as "data laundering."

- **Stability AI CEO Steps Down Amidst Chaos**: Stability AI's founder, Emad Mostaque, announced his resignation as CEO, confirmed by a [press release](https://stability.ai/news/stabilityai-announcement) from the company. Interim co-CEOs Shan Shan Wong and Christian Laforte will lead the search for a new permanent CEO, while speculation arises about the potential consequences for the company's direction and open-source commitments.

- **SD3 Model Expectations Set**: Previews of the SD3 model suggest it performs comparably to DALL-E 3 in certain contexts but overall struggles with understanding complex concepts and interactions within prompts. Despite a more realistic image generation capability, the SD3 model reportedly often assembles images in a collage-like fashion, without a clear blend of concepts.

- **AI Drama and Ethics in the Spotlight**: A message pointed to a conversation on Twitter where concerns were raised about the motivations behind prominent figures in the AI industry. This sparked a discussion about the ethical responsibilities of AI developers and researchers and the infatuation with AI "celebrity" culture on social media platforms.

- **Performance Challenges with AMD for AI**: Users shared their frustrations with AMD GPUs and ROCm support for ML workloads, comparing unfavorably to NVIDIA's solutions. Anecdotal evidence suggested AMD's lack of investment in consumer-level ML support could be a missed opportunity in the rise of generative AI models like Stable Diffusion.

- **Andrew Ng Predicts AI Workflow Revolution**: Andrew Ng, a co-founder of Google Brain, predicts that **AI agentic workflows** will drive significant progress in AI this year, potentially outpacing even next-generation foundation models. He emphasizes the importance of iterating over documents multiple times, such as outlining, drafting, and revising, contrasting it with the current zero-shot LLM approach ([Highlight from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1bl3s9r/andrew_ng_cofounder_of_google_brain_former_chief/)).

- **MIT CSAIL Speeds Up Image Generation**: MIT researchers have made a breakthrough by creating a framework that accelerates the image-generating process of tools like **Stable Diffusion** and **DALL-E** by 30 times, simplifying it to a single step without losing image quality, through a teacher-student model ([MIT News Article](https://news.mit.edu/2024/ai-generates-high-quality-images-30-times-faster-single-step-0321)).

- **NVIDIA Explores Training of Diffusion Models**: NVIDIA's blog post discusses the challenges in improving diffusion models and how they tackle issues shared by many neural networks during training. They point to their EDM2 code and model release and suggest ownership issues related to style normalization may require addressing through modifications like those in EDM2 ([NVIDIA Developer Blog Post](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/rethinking-how-to-train-diffusion-models/)).

- **Debating Unet's Relevance in an Era of Linear Networks**: Conversations cast doubt on the value of enhancements to Unet architectures given the shift toward linear network models for image generation tasks. Some argue that linear models do not require traditional normalization methods, while others express skepticism, suggesting that concepts like layer norm remain integral to neural network functionality.

- **Strategic Pruning and the Mystery of Middle Blocks**: Discussion on the resilience of large language models (LLMs) leads to the insight that removing blocks from the middle of the network causes minimal degradation to performance. This leads to speculation about the potential redundancy of certain network segments, especially "unet middle block," and the need for further study into the architectural peculiarities of linear networks.

- **Exploring LLM Biases and Defaults**: A robust discussion unfolded on biases in AI, specifically surrounding the default alignment of general-purpose LLMs like GPT towards a "Western liberal-centrist" value system. A user proposed the idea of creating multiple "aligned" versions of AI models, arguing that current LLMs implicitly present Western values as optimal by default.

- **Customizing ChatGPT**: The 'Customize ChatGPT' feature was highlighted as a way to inject personal values or cultural background into AI responses. It was suggested that instead of identifying AI biases, users could focus on how ChatGPT can add productive value to their lives.

- **Aligning AI to Non-Western Norms Proves Tricky**: Efforts to guide AI towards non-Western answers showed mixed results, with AI still tending to incline towards Western-centric ideals. Despite experimenting with inhibiting 'Western-centric' prompts such as 'TikTok' and attempting to influence it with non-Western scaffolding, the challenge remains to prevent the AI from exerting Western values on answers.

- **On Bias, Culture, and Reinforcement**: The conversation touched on concerns about whether AI may reinforce existing biases if aligned with specific cultural or political viewpoints. The discussion considered whether AI should aim to broaden views or if users should have options to specify political or cultural alignments.

- **Looking for Practical AI Solutions**: Users shared tips for handling common AI shortcomings like correcting DALL-E 3's misrepresentation of fingers and hands and the lack of a seed feature for subtle modifications. Discussion also ventured into the need for clearer communication from AI providers regarding certain features being excluded or postponed.

**Latent Space ▷ #[ai-general-chat](https://discord.com/channels/822583790773862470/1075282825051385876/1220707548311715891)** (164 messages🔥🔥): 

- **Searching for Video Processing Tool Like Whisper**: A user enquired about a tool comparable to Whisper but for video processing and mentioned that it possibly leveraged VLM for scene evaluation and was potentially open source. Multiple suggestions were made, including [Video Mamba](https://huggingface.co/blog/vladbogo/video-mamba), Twelve Labs, and video intelligence service [videodb.io](https://videodb.io).

- **OpenAI's Sora Wows Artists**: The OpenAI blog shared first impressions of Sora, revealing strong interest and endorsements from creative professionals. Examples of artist work were discussed, displaying how Sora enables the creation of both realistic and surreal imagery.

- **Google's AI Studio vs. Vertex AI Confusion**: Discussions revolved around the differences and usage of Google's AI Studio versus Vertex AI in serving up models like Gemini, with AI Studio starting to roll out 1 million token context APIs and comparisons made to the OpenAI API in terms of ease of use.

- **AI Wearables on a Roll**: Chat snippets focused on the trend of open-source AI wearables, including the $200 ALOHA project, and discussion on whether such products are fully local. Pre-orders for [Compass](https://x.com/itsmartynask/status/1771890769865187648), another AI wearable, began, with plans for shipping to start the following week.

- **Efficiency in Large Language Models**: LLMLingua by Microsoft was shared as a tool to compress LLM prompts and KV-Cache, potentially achieving up to 20x compression with minimal performance loss. It was suggested that while optimizing costs is essential, it's also crucial not to over-optimize too early and instead focus on delivering value.
