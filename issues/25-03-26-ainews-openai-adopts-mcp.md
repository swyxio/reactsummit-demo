> `Custom GPTs, Browser Cache, Long Context LLM, GPL_v3, Mermaid Diagrams` 


- **Custom GPTs working same for everyone**: Custom GPTs will work the same for anyone who uses it, but o1 has a **thinking tier** not available to plus users.
   - You can also make a *practice custom GPT* in *Projects* as a testbed, where you work on updates, since it's structured practically identically on the hardware side.
- **Optimizing ChatGPT Memory with Parser Tools**: A member explored creating a tool that optimizes **ChatGPT memory** by compressing memories from browser cache into 'what GPT should know about you'.
   - The member referenced scholarly paper [*Lost in the middle: Long Context LLM*](https://example.com/Lost-in-the-middle) that describes the phenomenon, which means transformers aren't great at finding and attending tokens in the middle of the context window.
- **GitHub Publishing Requires Skill, but not Academic Rigor**: A member mentioned that by loosening up and explaining some of what you're doing, you've demonstrated at least *some* skill, and that publishing to GitHub means you're skilled.
   - The member also noted that OpenAI *seem* to require masters degrees in machine learning for their engineers from job listings and anecdotes from folks they know who've applied, so *the hurdle isn't talent but academic rigor, regrettably*.
- **Floating Comments in Custom GPTs build instructions**: Including specific requests in the comments of the code will greatly increase the quality of the output, so a member built a template with a **floating comment** that gives instructions relevant to each section, with instructions relevant to each section.
   - The AI moves the comment step-by-step, per the instructions, walking the member through building the GPT.
- **Mermaid Diagrams for AI Task Flow**: A member suggested using **Mermaid diagrams** to visualize the logic of AI task flows, providing an example diagram illustrating the interaction between User, AI, Reasoner, and Executor.
   - The diagram outlines phases such as *Initial Analysis, Strategic Planning, Execution Planning, Implementation, Integration & Verification, and Refinement*, enabling a visual understanding of the task execution process.

   - They reported experiencing issues where the model reverts to its pre-finetuned state after loading from HF despite using **GGUF saving methods**, and inquired about potential conflicts with `FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model)`.
- **Troubleshooting "Gemma3Config" Error and Training Times**: A user reported encountering a `'Gemma3Config' object has no attribute 'ignore_index'` error and noted a **24-hour training time** for **Qwen 2.5 32B instruct** on a single A100, compared to **8 hours** on 2xH100s via DeepSpeed.
   - They shared [Unsloth configuration details](https://discordapp.com/channels/1179035537009545276/1179035537529643040/1354175079713562644) including **Transformers 4.50.1**, **CUDA 8.0**, and a **0.81% trainable parameter ratio**.
- **Multi-GPU Rig Performance Varies**: A member shared their multi-GPU setup experience (RTX 4000 SFF and RTX 2000 ADA in tensor parallel on PCIe gen 4 x8), noting performance varied between **0.8x** and **2.5x** compared to single-GPU setups.
   - They suggest that while additional GPUs *can* improve performance, results are highly scenario-specific due to factors like context length and quantization, and PCIe gen 4 riser cable signal integrity starts becoming dicey.
- **Unsloth Releases DeepSeek V3 Dynamic GGUFs**: Unsloth announced the release of **DeepSeek V3 Dynamic GGUFs** with selective layer quantization, shrinking the model from **720GB to 231GB (70% reduction)**.
   - A link to the [Dynamic GGUF guide](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/tutorial-how-to-run-deepseek-v3-0324-locally) and the [GGUF files](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V3-0324-GGUF) were shared; a fix of a duplicate file issue in `UD-Q2_K_XL` was also noted.
- **Full Finetuning Option Now Supported**: Members confirmed that Unsloth now supports **full parameter finetuning**, implying that the `get_peft_model` step can be skipped for full finetuning.
   - However, it was noted that [full fine-tuning with Gemma 3 may not be working](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/2101) due to a potential upstream issue.

> `Gemma3Config issue, Deepseek replacement models, Unsloth training failures, Cerebras model loading error, GRPO trainer OOM issues` 


- ****Gemma3Config Glitch Grips Users****: Users reported a `Gemma3Config` issue, specifically that the object has no attribute `ignore_index`, while trying to use Unsloth.
   - This appears to be a configuration issue when working with Gemma models, potentially related to loading them with VLLM, as detailed in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/2086).
- ****Deepseek Data Dive: Distilled or Direct?****: A user inquired about **Deepseek** replacement models, questioning whether they are trained on the same data as other models or if they are distilled from default training sets.
   - This delves into the specifics of the training data and methodology behind Deepseek, a crucial aspect for understanding model capabilities and limitations.
- ****Local Unsloth Training Troubleshoot****: A user reported consistent failures when attempting to train with Unsloth, experiencing issues with VRAM overload and script errors.
   - Solutions involved using Jupyter notebooks, creating Python virtual environments, and carefully managing dependencies, with a member suggesting Ubuntu as a better local option over Colab.
- ****Cerebras Code Compilation Causes Chaos****: Users encountered a `RuntimeError` when loading **Cerebras** models, specifically an *unexpected indent* error in the compiled module.
   - The fix involved correcting an indentation issue in `compiler.py`, as mentioned in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/2179), suggesting the error is due to the **Cerebras** architecture interacting poorly with the compiler.
- ****GRPO Gremlins Gobble GPU Memory****: Users reported running into **Out-of-Memory (OOM)** issues when using the **GRPO trainer**, particularly when fine-tuning **Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct** and other **VLM models**.

- **Pivotal Token Search Questioned**: Members discussed the **Pivotal Token Search (PTS)** strategy from the [Phi-4 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08905.pdf), with skepticism about its practical impact.
   - While compelling in theory, the ablation studies showed only a **minimal performance gain of 2-3%**, and it was notably absent in the **phi-4-mini** report.
- **ByteDance Training Policy Interest Arises**: A member inquired about **ByteDance's training policy** after resolving an issue by adding a chat template during inference.
   - The user reported that after adding the EOS (*end of sentence*) token in the dataset and putting the chat template when inferencing, it *works flawlessly*.
- **DAPO RL System Released**: A member shared the [BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO](https://github.com/BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO) **open-source RL system** from ByteDance Seed and Tsinghua AIR.
   - They noted that the release seemed to have *gone under the radar* despite its potential significance.

> `Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o Image Generation, DeepSeek V3, OpenRouter Pricing, Stripe Payment Issues` 


- ****Gemini 2.5 Pro: Hot Model, High Rate Limits****: Users find **Gemini 2.5 Pro** impressive, especially for generating books, but are frustrated by low rate limits, with the official limit being **50 requests per 24 hours** as per [Google's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/quotas-genai).
   - Despite the model's high quality, some suggest falling back to paid models like **Sonnets 3.7** and **Flash 2.0** due to the restrictive limits and express interest in a paid API for increased usage.
- ****OR Eyes API for Native Image Gen, GPT-4o Style****: Following the release of **GPT-4o's native image generation**, the community is asking about OpenRouter potentially adding API functionality for image generation calls.
   - A staff member confirmed image generation support is actively under development, though image generation isn't currently supported for **OpenRouter** and instead suggests alternatives like the **Chutes provider**.
- ****DeepSeek V3: Fast and Furious (When China Sleeps)****: Members are discussing **DeepSeek V3's** good price, optimized deployment, and speed, especially when **China** is asleep, and one also shared a [test](https://rentry.org/deepseekv3-vs-v3-0325) comparing **Deepseek V3** vs **Deepseek V3 0324**.
   - One member finds the provider *competitive* and notes that it is the *best non-reasoning model* on most tasks and another member finds the quality and prompt adherence of **Fireworks** is better but at a price.
- ****Fireworks Basic Endpoint Gets The Boot****: A member asked about the **Fireworks Basic endpoint** and a staff member said that *Fireworks asked us to remove them temporarily*.
   - Another member wonders about adding tool usage for the **Fireworks endpoint** but a staff member only says that they can *look into it*.
- ****OpenRouter Under Investigation, Card Data Breaches Possible****: One member reported their card was compromised after using OpenRouter and speculated the issue was on their end due to OpenRouter using Stripe.
   - The OpenRouter team is investigating, emphasizing they don't store card info and rely on Stripe for payment processing and another member suggested contacting **Stripe** or the card-issuing bank for better answers.

> `OpenRouter, Hyperparams, Academic Evals vs Production, OpenAI Spending Controls` 


- **OpenRouter lets you tweak Hyperparams**: When using **OpenRouter** with open models, users can specify they want **bf16/fp16**.
   - Same with **max_tokens** and **temperature**, which is increasingly important, but choosing the right one is still debated.
- **Academic Evals vs Product temperature**: It was suggested that when doing products, you probably want to use the **recommended / best temp for each model**.
   - But for *academic evals* you want to have it **consistent**.
- **OpenAI spending control is non-existent**: It was claimed that when using **OpenAI's API** at scale their dashboard isn't accurate and their spending controls don't work.
   - In fact *you can go negative even with inference*.

> `Gemini 2.5, ChatGPT, Claude, O1 Pro` 


- **Gemini 2.5 Benchmarks High but Lacks Practicality**: Despite **Gemini 2.5** outperforming others in benchmarks, one user questioned if it requires too much effort to use and whether **ChatGPT** or **Claude** are still preferable for general use.
   - The other user agreed, noting that for general chat, **ChatGPT** is their favorite, **Claude** is preferred for interactive coding, and **O1 Pro** is used for scripts, plus **OpenAI** deep research for research.
- **Google's Chatbot Faces Justification Challenge**: A user finds it hard to justify adding another chat bot into their routine unless it is significantly better than current options.
   - This poses a problem for **Google** since their offering doesn't seem unique enough to warrant the switch, highlighting that a product's performance isn't enough if the user experience is lacking.
- **ChatGPT Remains a Favorite Despite Benchmarks**: One user admitted that their post might have been overly praising of **Gemini 2.5** despite the product feeling *blah*.
   - They compared it to **Apple's** user base moat, suggesting that even with many users, a poor product will lead people to stick with what they're already used to due to time sensitivity.
- **GPT-4.5 Speculation Arises**: In a brief exchange, a user simply asked "4.5?", presumably referring to **GPT-4.5**.

> `Tokenizing on GPU vs CPU, Gemini 2.5 Pro experience, LM Studio Dockerization, Uncensored Models on LM Studio, Cursor vs Copilot` 


- **Tokenizing Troubles Trigger Threaded Throttle**: A user noticed **LM Studio** pushing a single CPU thread to full throttle during tokenization with a **200k token input**, questioning whether tokenization is fully GPU-based, while another user indicated that flash attention and cache settings for K and V have impacts.
   - One user expressed confusion, stating *tokenizing is finished way before flash attention or KV cache come into play*, suggesting further investigation into why changing the 'k' cache impacts the beginning of the *thinking process*.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Puzzle Performance**: Users discussed **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, with one user sharing a [link](https://www.hopeless.fr/share/msedge_O0y9jZHBZV.png) to use it for free on **AI Studio** and another reporting it correctly solved a logic puzzle that **2.0 Flash Thinking** could not.
   - The prompt involved deducing seating arrangements at a round table with clues about the characters and their origins, ultimately showcasing **Gemini 2.5 Pro's** reasoning capabilities.
- **Docker Dreams Deferred for Desktop-Devoted LM Studio**: Users discussed containerizing **LM Studio**, with one user recommending searching the channels for 'docker' or 'headless', but concluding that a fully functional setup *how you want* is unlikely right now, and that if you want an API service, use something like **ollama**.
   - Another user stated *LM Studio is best used as a pure desktop application rn*, noting *there are plans for full headless and official docker builds in the future but no eta on those.*
- **Uncensored AI: Rocinante Rides with Limited VRAM**: A user asked about *the best uncensored ai models to load in LLM* with **16GB DDR4** and an **i5 12th gen**, and another user noted *the best ones won't work on your machine*, suggesting **Rocinante 12B** for lower-end machines with a link to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/TheDrummer/Rocinante-12B-v1.1-GGUF).
   - It was noted that with a **4GB GPU**, one *won't be able to run much* and suggested checking uncensored **1-3b** models, with another pointing out the RAM is less relevant than **VRAM**.
- **Cursor's Cool Code Completion Captivates Coders**: A user inquired about the advantages of **Cursor** over **GitHub Copilot** in VS Code, with another highlighting **agent mode** and general *good vibe* of tab completion.
   - While preferring to *fix stuff or generate code*, it was mentioned that **Cursor** allows choosing the model and provides unlimited regular requests, contrasting it to fighting with a *todler*.

> `Embedding Matrix Redundancy, Deeper MLP for Weight Savings, PCA for Embedding Alignment, Low Rank Projection Issues, Character-Level LLMs vs. Tokenized LLMs` 


- **LLM Embeddings Spark Redundancy Debate**: Members debated the [rationale of using a single large matrix for the embedding matrix in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16975), questioning its potential redundancy.
   - One member suggested using a *deeper MLP to save on the number of weights*, prompting discussions about the trade-offs between expressivity and parameter efficiency.
- **PCA Alignment Attracts Algorithm Attention**: Members considered applying **PCA** to the input embeddings to achieve *axis-alignment* and potentially use a **highly sparse triangular matrix**.
   - The idea involved rotating the LLM's internal embeddings, but the feasibility of doing so remained uncertain.
- **Low Rank Projection Plunges Parameter Predicament**: One member suggested a **two-layer MLP** with an internal dimension smaller than *d* as a straightforward approach, but doubts were raised about compressing the input embedding into a space smaller than the model's hidden size.
   - It was noted that with **two matrices (NxL) and (LxH)** instead of just **(NxH)**, L would need to be less than **H/2** for parameter efficiency, leading to halved dimensionality without memory benefits or improved performance.
- **Character-Level LLMs Compete for Comprehension**: A member expressed curiosity about whether **character-level LLMs** could match the performance of **tokenized LLMs** if FLOPS were normalized across training and inference.
   - It was noted that prior publications on **byte-level transformers** introduced intermediate steps to group characters, suggesting that a direct approach may not be as effective.
- **Dynamic Differentiable Hashing Debated**: Some members proposed **dynamic hashing** techniques that are differentiable, aiming to maintain almost-orthogonality among tokens during training and group tokens closer together.
   - It was noted that a tree or bucket hash could be used for de-embedding and might be more efficient than a matrix multiplication at inference time, though such methods aren't inherently differentiable.

   - However, despite performing well in benchmarks, the model's `transformers_version` is **4.36.0** and context is limited to **16k**, which leaves some waiting for **Qwen 3** to surpass it.
- **Qwen 3 Rumored to Debut**: There is speculation around the upcoming release of **Qwen 3**, with one member pointing out that its configuration looks similar to what **Qwen** is rumored to release.
   - Another member added a link to a discussion suggesting that **Qwen 3 15B-A2B** is **15.3B** (**1.75B active**) based on the default config in the transformers PR ([Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jgio2g/qwen_3_is_coming_soon/mizhs8v/)).

> `torch.compile transpose error, Flash attention autograd stall, PyTorch documentation redesign` 


- **Transpose Troubles with Torch Compile**: A member reported an error with `torch.compile` when using multiple transposes in a line of code involving matrix multiplication, specifically `C =  (A.transpose(1,2) @ B.transpose(1,3).transpose(1,2).contiguous()).transpose(1,2)`.
   - The issue seems inconsistent, as the same line works fine in isolation within a unit test, suggesting a deeper problem with how `torch.compile` handles this specific operation in a larger context.
- **Flash Attention stalls during autograd**: When running a custom kernel adapted from flash attention, a member observed that it sometimes stalls for a long time at `autograd::engine::evaluate_function`, as shown in [this image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1189607750876008468/1354449060353933332/image.png?ex=67e5547c&is=67e402fc&hm=a510e1b12933e16d1992dc09cfa33e0028286e5bf186915905125966e3d601a8&).
   - The member speculates this may be due to Triton JIT recompiling, but is unsure how to confirm.
- **New PyTorch Docs: Dropdown is godly**: Users discussed the [new PyTorch documentation redesign](https://docs-preview.pytorch.org/pytorch/pytorch/149331/index.html), with a lot of feedback given.

> `Transformers Generalization, Hypernetworks, Test-time compute` 


- **Composable Latent Codes for Transformer Generalization**: A member highlighted a paper, ["Composable Latent Codes for Generalization in Transformers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05816), noting its interpretability by viewing activations along the head-number dimension as a latent code specifying task/context.
   - The paper reformulates multi-head attention as a **hypernetwork** and finds the latent code is predictive of subtasks the network performs on unseen task compositions.
- **Task Latent Codes in Fast Weight Transformers**: A member suggested that [Fast Weight Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06295) already formulated this concept with a task latent code that sets up weight slices.
   - The member clarified that the **head-wise understanding is more interpretable** in the hypernetwork paper, though a similar concept may have been present in earlier work.
- **Hottest Test-Time Compute Papers Sought**: A member requested recommendations for the **hottest test-time compute papers**, seeking 2-3 papers to start with.

- ****Privileged Basis** Definition Sought**: A member asked for an explanation of what a *privileged basis* is, noting difficulty in fully understanding its purpose.
   - Another member responded that the concept is somewhat ill-defined.
- **Point-wise nonlinearities transform points**: One member explained privileged basis in terms of **point-wise nonlinearities** transforming points on a unit ball, where some directions (basis-aligned) *retain more information* and are considered privileged, [as illustrated in an attached image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1052314805576400977/1354537454178144366/image.png?ex=67e5a6cf&is=67e4554f&hm=8b9b2ef959ec9e06f441f1a002b4efa7dd1f6c91177b674fed8cde8c1b589cd8&).
- **Privileged by whom?**: A member problematized the concept of 'privileged,' suggesting the need to specify *privileged by whom* and questioning assumptions about uniform distribution and equal information content of points on the unit ball.
   - They noted that while the concept might be useful in some cases, it warrants critical examination.

- **Request for GPT-NeoX Usage Clarification**: A member inquired about using **GPT-NeoX** for a **7B/1T Common Pile v0.1** training run, seeking confirmation on the expected data format (**giant jsonl** with one document per line in the "text" field).
   - They raised concerns about **chunking long documents** (>10M tokens) and how **GPT-NeoX** handles documents exceeding the context length.
- **Tackling Long Document Chunking in GPT-NeoX**: The member described a method of pre-chunking documents into length-N segments before shuffling, aiming to avoid correlated examples when processing very long documents.
   - Since the **GPT-NeoX** preprocessing script for tokenization doesn't include this, they plan to do it separately, and asked for confirmation.
- **Confirmation and Guidance on GPT-NeoX Data Processing**: A member confirmed the user's understanding but noted their limited recent experience with the relevant code.
   - They directed the user to other members who have recent experience with data processing in **GPT-NeoX** for further assistance.

> `Open Source Automatic Evaluations, LlamaIndex Workflow for Agentic application, OpenAI's responses api, LlamaExtract Schema Inference, Postgres database analysis using LlamaIndex` 


- **Open Source Automatic Evaluations**: An early-stage founder is validating an idea for **open-source automatic evaluations** that doesn't require prompt engineering, aiming to solve the effort required to write and tune multiple evaluation prompts and inconsistent LLM Judging tools.
   - The founder's team has developed proprietary models that **automatically extract instructions** and evaluate LLM responses using an API call with no evaluation prompts and claim their models beat leading LLMs like **GPT-4o** on industry benchmarks.
- **Dynamic Event Handling in LlamaIndex Workflows**: A user is implementing an agentic application using **LlamaIndex Workflows** with four step functions and is dynamically deciding whether to call the second and third step functions in parallel or only call the second based on an LLM call in the first step function.
   - Currently the number of step functions triggered is stored in the context variable to be used by the fourth step function to wait for the triggered events, which another member said *sounds like the recommended way to do this*.
- **Coming Soon: OpenAI's responses api interaction in LlamaIndex**: A member inquired about **LlamaIndex** supporting interaction with **OpenAI's responses API**.
   - Another member responded that it's *not yet*, but an **OpenAIResponses** class is expected to release soon.
- **LlamaExtract's Schema Inference**: A user asked about the **schema inference** feature mentioned in the **LlamaExtract** announcement last year and why it seems to have disappeared in the latest announcement.
   - A member explained that *it overall wasn't useful* as most users already had their desired schema, so it was de-prioritized, but *it will probably come back at some point*.
- **Navigating Postgres Data Analysis with LlamaIndex**: A user with a **Postgres database** containing relational data is looking for advice on analyzing it with **LlamaIndex** to gain insights.
   - A member suggested using a **text-to-SQL** application for querying the relational data, and they mentioned that although the Python repo has some stuff for it, *its easy enough to build using llms and prompts*.
