Congrats to [Groq's shareholders' net worth going up](ttps://x.com/groqinc/status/1820422643004424631?s=46) while  everyone else's goes down (and [Intel's CEO prays](https://x.com/datnofact/status/1820213413319962975?s=61)). Nicholas Carlini of DeepMind is getting some recognition (and [criticism](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2024/why-i-attack.html)) as one of the most thoughtful public writers on AI with a research background. This year he has been broadening out from his usual [adversarial stomping grounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17035) with his [benchmark for large language models](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2024/my-benchmark-for-large-language-models.html) and made waves this weekend with an [80,000 word treatise on How He Uses AI](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2024/how-i-use-ai.html), which we of course [used AI to summarize](https://claude.ai/chat/157b11d3-cec1-4a97-877f-da829d6f2a39):

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/820a8c18-851b-4862-9821-fce5d442da5f.png?w=960&fit=max) 

as well as usecases:

And, impressively, he says that this is "less than 2%" of the usecases for LLMs he has had (that's 4 million words of writing if he listed everything).

Chris Dixon is [known](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years) for saying "What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years". When people blow [wind on the setting AI Winter](https://www.latent.space/p/q2-2024-recap) saying it hasn't produced enough measurable impact at work, they may simply be too short term oriented. Each of these is at least worth polished tooling, if not a startup.

**[Sponsored by Box]** Box stores docs. Box can also **extract structured data** from those docs. [Here’s how to do it using the Box AI API.](https://medium.com/box-developer-blog/extracting-structured-data-using-box-ai-01408437352d). 

**swyx comment**: S3's rigidity is Box's opportunity here. The idea of a "multimodal Box" - stick anything in there, get structured data out - makes all digital content legible to machines. Extra kudos to the blogpost for also showing that this solution -like any LLM-driven one- can fail unexpectedly!
