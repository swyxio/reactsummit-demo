> AI News for 1/30/2025-1/31/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **34** Discords (**225** channels, and **9062** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **843 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

As planned even before the DeepSeek r1 drama, [OpenAI released o3-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/), with the "high" reasoning effort option handily outperforming o1-full (and [handily so in OOD benchmarks like Dan Hendrycks' new HLE](https://x.com/DanHendrycks/status/1885476082473984475) and [Text to SQL](https://x.com/rishdotblog/status/1885420294049030149?s=46) benchmarks, though [Cursor disagrees](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/1885415392677675337)):

The main area of R1 response was two fold: first [a 63% cut in o1-mini and o3-mini prices](https://x.com/swyx/status/1885432031896887335), and second [Sam Altman acknowledging in today's Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ieonxv/ama_with_openais_sam_altman_mark_chen_kevin_weil/) that they will be showing "[a much more helpful and detailed version](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ieonxv/comment/ma9z9yy/)" of thinking tokens, directly crediting DeepSeek R1 for "updating" his assumptions.

Perhaps more significantly, Sama also acknowledged being "[on the wrong side of history](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ieonxv/comment/maa0dcx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)" in their (not materially existent beyond Whisper) open source strategy.
