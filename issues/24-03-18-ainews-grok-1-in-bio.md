<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 3/15/2024-3/18/2024. We checked [**358** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **21** Discords (**337** channels, and **9841** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **1033 minutes**.

After Elon promised to release it last week, [Grok-1 is now open](https://x.ai/blog/grok-os), with a characteristically platform native announcement:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f921d288-93bd-46c3-8f0b-9a5d33d87efd.png?w=960&fit=max) 

If you don't get the "in bio" thing, just ignore it, it's a silly in-joke/doesn't matter.

[the GH repo](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-1) offers a few more details:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/e49e4308-58f9-401d-b9e0-936b6d534da2.png?w=960&fit=max)

Unsloth's Daniel Han went thru the architecture and [called out a few notable differences](https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1769550950270910630?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug), but nothing groundbreaking it seems.

Grok-1 is great that it appears to be a brand new, from-scratch open LLM that people can use, but its size makes it difficult to finetune, which Arthur Mensch of Mistral is slyly poking at:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/5c601191-7a72-4641-9d59-5d239cdf0cd9.png?w=960&fit=max) 

However [folks like Perplexity have already pledged to finetune it](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1769485603622867394) and undoubtedly the capabilities of Grok-1 will be mapped out now that it is in the wild. Ultimately the  [MMLU performance doesn't seem impressive](https://x.com/francis_yao_/status/1769575936994013611?s=46&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww), and (since we have no details on the dataset) the speculation is that [it is an upcycled Grok-0, undertrained for its size and Grok-2 will be more interesting](ttps://x.com/teortaxestex/status/1769460562763604375?s=46&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww).

- **Epoch Count Debate**: Members discussed the **optimal number of epochs** for training, generally agreeing that 3 epochs is standard, with concerns that too many epochs may cause a model to memorize and overfit to training data.
- **Seeking Balance in Model Knowledge**: A lengthy conversation centered around finetuning large language models (LLMs) with excessive data. It was pointed out that finetuning can lead to learning a style rather than gaining knowledge, and that a large number of epochs may cause an LLM to *forget everything else*.
- **LLM Parameter Ratio Recommendations**: During the discussion, it was suggested that **rank size** should be considered, with a recommendation that the amount of **trainable parameters** should be equal to the **amount of tokens** in the dataset. A suggestion was made for 32 or 64 rank for 800,000 lines of data.
- **Scaling Down Data for Training**: One member decided to reduce their dataset from 3 million lines to a smaller number to help the LLM perform better.
- **Integration of Small Models into Unsloth Repo**: Links to two small models, **Tiny Mistral** and **Tiny Mistral Instruct**, were shared for potentially integrating into the Unsloth AI repository.

- **RAG-Ready Model Wishlist Outlined**: Discussions converged around desirable features for a model to integrate into Retriever Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines: low latency, handling large contexts, variety in general knowledge, function extraction, intent decomposition, and markdown-rich output structure. Some of these were detailed in a [shared feature set](https://github.com/EveryOneIsGross/scratchTHOUGHTS/blob/main/commanDUH.py) demonstrating a RAG system prompt.
  
- **Structured Output for Easier Citation**: There was an interest in having models like Cohere's that provide structured output, such as inline citations, to facilitate easier referencing. This was illustrated using a JSON output example from Cohere's documentation.

- **HyDE as a Staple in RAG Pipelines**: The discussion pointed to *HyDE* (Hypothetical context), a known technique in RAG pipelines, and the desire to incorporate similar mechanisms within new models to improve their understanding of context, reasoning, and extracting or condensating responses.

- **Fine-Tuning for Reasoning**: A proposal was made to fine-tune models on examples where they generate and extract information from their own created documents, thereby increasing the workload on the model's recall capabilities.

- **Big vs Small RAG Models**: There was agreement that smaller models might be more suitable for large RAG pipelines due to frequency of calls, suggesting an approach akin to using specialized 'little go-betweens,' such as "relevant info extractors," for efficient processing.

- **Discussions Around Thought Tokens in Language Models**: A Reddit concept suggesting the introduction of <ThoughtStream> tokens in LLMs sparked debate. Some agree that this could improve the models' reasoning capabilities, while others refer to related works, like [Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09629) and [Feedback Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09402), which explore similar ideas of enhancing the computational steps available to LLMs.

- **Efforts to Make Government-Funded AI Models Public**: A crosspost from the Hugging Face Discord suggested a FOIA request for the model weights and dataset from Oakridge National Laboratory's 1 trillion parameter model. Responses voiced skepticism about the feasibility and utility of this due to potential classified data and existing legal barriers.

- **Dissection of Performance Stats**: Participants discussed the uncertainties in evaluating models like **Mistral-7b** on benchmarks such as GSM8k, noting discrepancies in reported performance metrics and expressing skepticism about baseline evaluations. Some pointed to appendices showing outputs generated with high-temperature sampling and no nucleus sampling, which may not optimally reflect major-at-first-prompt evaluation.

- **RL and its Scalability**: The conversation touched on the challenges and scale issues of applying reinforcement learning to encourage 'deeper thinking' in language models, with one suggesting that a supervised approach might yield better results in fostering this aspect of model behavior.

- **Right-to-Left (R2L) Number Tokenization Discussed**: A user questioned why numbers aren't tokenized backwards by standard tokenizers, considering that it's easier for models to perform arithmetic in this format. This spurred a discussion on right-aligned tokenization, with one mention of a relevant study on L2R versus R2L performance in GPT models examined via a [tweet](https://x.com/Aaditya6284/status/1762558439354409345).

- **Revealing API-Protected LLMs' Secrets**: A paper was shared ([arXiv:2403.09539](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09539)) showing that a significant amount of information about API-protected large language models can be determined from a relatively small number of queries, due to modern LLMs suffering from a softmax bottleneck.

- **Grok: The Latest Model On the Block**: Users discussed the release of **Grok-1**, a new 314-billion-parameter language model by xAI, often comparing it to existing models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. There was speculation on the model's training process, the adequacy of benchmarks for newer models this size, and the strategic motivations behind its creation and release.

- **Chaining OpenAI Agents Issue**: A member encountered a `400 Error` when attempting to chain multiple OpenAI agents, receiving a message about invalid content ([related message](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/deploying/agents/tools/root.html)). Another member clarified that usually this means the content sent was empty and inquired about sample code that was used.
- **LlamaIndex Support for Xinference**: One member reported difficulty when deploying LlamaIndex with Xinference and asked for installation help in a cluster. Another member explained that information on how to use Xinference with LlamaIndex and provided detailed guidance ([here is a brief guide](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/docs/examples/llm/xinference_local_deployment.ipynb)) but there was no specific mention of cluster environments.
- **Fine-Tuning Local LLMs**: A member asked how to specify arguments for `PandasQueryEngine` and was advised on the importance of column names in the `pandasquery engine`. They also discussed making `Settings.embed_model=bm25`, but there was no direct support for this setting in LlamaIndex ([related discussion about embedding models](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/models/embeddings.html)).
- **LlamaIndex for Chatbots Influenced by Characters**: An extensive discussion unfolded about creating chatbots in the style of certain characters like James Bond, involving RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and fine-tuning, but ultimately some concluded that prompt engineering might be more effective than trying to use a dataset or fine-tuning ([related guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot)).
- **How to Handle Multimodal Content with LLMs**: A few members discussed how to differentiate and handle multimodal content within LLMs, mentioning that order could be lost in chat messages if not managed correctly. They also shared concerns about potential maintenance headaches if APIs change or when existing LLMs add support for multimodal content ([here is an example for handling multimodal content](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/use_cases/extraction.html)).

- **Rationale Behind Attention Mechanism**: The attention mechanism was discussed, highlighting its ability to enable global "attention" in any input sequence, overcoming the fixed-length limitations of previous models which only considered up to length T in sequences.
- **Transformers Solve Parallelization**: The creation of the attention mechanism was noted to primarily address parallelization issues, allowing for independent processing of different tokens and enabling faster training due to efficient computation.
- **Clarification on Attention and Parallelization**: An explanation was provided that attention models permit the decoder to focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequence, using a weighted combination of all encoded input vectors, thus enabling the model to consider all parts of the input sequence.
- **Understanding the Efficiency of Attention**: It was clarified that the parallelization in attention models stems from performing computations like the scaled dot product operation without needing to sequentially wait for previous calculations to complete.
- **Appreciation for LLM Paper Club Session**: The session was commended for providing clarity and broader understanding about the motivation behind transformer models and overall developments in the field of large language models (LLMs).

- **Exploring Warp Schedulers and Thread Efficiency**: A member inquired about how many warp schedulers can be defined and the control they have over threads to optimize efficiency occupancy. It's about understanding how many threads can run simultaneously for maximum efficiency.
- **Clarification on "Active Warp" Definition**: A discussion was held on the meaning of an "active warp." It was clarified that an "active warp" generally implies at least one active thread, despite technically being possible to have an "active warp" with no active threads, highlighting a grey area in understanding warp activation within CUDA programming.
- **Convenience vs. Necessity in Memory Management Options**: An exchange took place regarding whether different memory allocation options in CUDA (ProducerProvides, ConsumerProvides, etc.) are convenience features or technical necessities. It was noted that opting for only Provides and Provides might not allow leveraging the case with zero copies, and could necessitate a streamSynchronize, breaking the optimization.
- **Understanding CUDA Memory Management Semantics**: Details on the semantics of memory manager classes in CUDA were explained; "ProducerProvides" implies the producer owns the pointer and "ConsumerTakes" means a pointer is taken that was preallocated at the application's start. Emphasis was placed on these semantics not being explicit in code syntax.

- **KPU Unveiled as a Game Changer**: Maisa announces a new framework, the [Knowledge Processing Unit (KPU)](https://maisa.ai/blog/kpu), designed to enhance the capabilities of LLMs by separating reasoning from data processing, claimed to outperform models like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus in reasoning tasks.
- **State of the Art or State of Confusion?**: Members express amusement and skepticism over KPU's benchmarking practices, noting that comparisons are made against GPT-4 rather than the expected GPT-4-turbo, drawing parallels to Claude 3's similar approach.
- **New Technology or Clever Prompting?**: A member queries the underlying technology of KPU, speculating whether it's simply advanced prompt engineering, with another responding that it appears to be a mix of self-evaluation techniques and context window manipulation.
- **Details and Doubts on Performance**: Discussion ensues on the KPU's lack of latency information, suggesting that while it may improve certain metrics, it could introduce significant delay, questioning the practicality of its integration into products.
- **CEO Clarifies KPU's Mechanics**: The CEO of Maisa explains that the KPU, not a model itself, works in tandem with LLMs, acting as a "GPU for knowledge management," enhancing the performance and cost-effectiveness of existing models, while a notebook for independent evaluation is offered to researchers with access provided upon request ([Tweet from CEO](https://x.com/davipar/status/1768683151780683919?s=20)).
