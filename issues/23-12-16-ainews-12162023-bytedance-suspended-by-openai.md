- **Using RUNPOD_API_KEY and RUNPOD_POD_ID to control Runpod**: `@caseus_` explained that Runpod provides environment variables (`RUNPOD_API_KEY` and `RUNPOD_POD_ID`) which can be used to make API calls to control the pod, potentially to shut it down. They also posted a link to [Runpod's "Stop Pod" documentation](https://docs.runpod.io/docs/stop-pod) and shared an example curl command, but noted that "stop" isn't the same as "terminate".
- **Configuring Runpod container to exit after task completion**:`@_jp1_` expressed a desire for a Runpod container to exit as soon as a self-contained training task was complete, as Runpod's default behavior appears to be to restart the container indefinitely. Because running the container can be costly, they were looking for a solution that wouldn't require an external server or service to monitor the job and stop the container. 
- **Suggestion for Automatically Stopping Runpod After Task Completion**: In response to `_jp1_`, `@caseus_` suggested setting up a callback at the end of training that would shut down the container once the task was complete. This could possibly involve a timer to make sure the final checkpoint is uploaded before shutdown.
- **Viewing Images Without a Base URL**: `@mustapha7150` asked how to view an image when the output did not contain a base URL. This question wasn't answered in the provided messages.
