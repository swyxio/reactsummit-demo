> AI News for 12/4/2024-12/5/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **31** Discords (**206** channels, and **6267** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **627 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

As Sama teased, OpenAI's 12 days of shipmas ([which perhaps includes the Sora API](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312352/openai-sora-o1-reasoning-12-days-shipmas) and [perhaps GPT4.5](https://x.com/scaling01/status/1864708868833411188?s=46)) kicked off with the full o1 launch:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBfQTnA2n2s

and the clearest win is that o1 can see now, which [Hyungwon notes makes it the SOTA multimodal model](https://x.com/hwchung27/status/1864764887165272190?s=46):

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/caec0b66-5cdb-4465-8662-da450bc4b6d7.png?w=960&fit=max)

Although it still has [embarrassing bugs](https://x.com/nickfloats/status/1864809576840704189?s=46).


As with all frontier reasoning models, we have to resort to new reasoning/instruction following evals:

Tool use, system messages and API access are on their way.

The community reviews have been [mixed](https://x.com/emollick/status/1864741492327133271?s=46), focusing on obligatory [system card](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42330666) detailing safety assessments (with standard [alarmism](https://x.com/nabeelqu/status/1864757568708464743?s=46)) and mitigations , because the mitigations did appreciably 'nerf' the base o1-full:
