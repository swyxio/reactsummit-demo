  New research papers introduce promising **Llama Extensions** including
  **TinyLlama**, a compact **1.1B** parameter model pretrained on about **1
  trillion tokens** for 3 epochs, and **LLaMA Pro**, an **8.3B** parameter model
  expanding **LLaMA2-7B** with additional training on **80 billion tokens** of
  code and math data. LLaMA Pro adds layers to avoid catastrophic forgetting and
  balances language and code tasks but faces scrutiny for not using newer models
  like **Mistral** or **Qwen**. Meanwhile, **OpenAI** Discord discussions reveal
  insights on **GPT-4** token limits, privacy reassurances, fine-tuning for
  GPT-3.5, challenges with multi-language image recognition, custom GPT creation
  requiring **ChatGPT Plus**, and security concerns in GPT deployment. Users

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> This is 2 day's worth of content because we missed yesterday.

New papers released show very promising Llama Extensions:

- [TinyLlama: An Open-Source Small Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02385): (we wrote about this in previous AINews issues, but this is the paper) We present TinyLlama, a compact 1.1B language model pretrained on around 1 trillion tokens for approximately 3 epochs. ([written up on Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/11/01/2023/microsoft-pushes-the-boundaries-of-small-ai-models))
- [LLaMA Pro: Progressive LLaMA with Block Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02415): LLaMA-Pro is an 8.3 billion parameter model. It's an expansion of LLaMA2-7B, further trained on code and math corpora totaling 80 billion tokens
  - Adding new knowledge to Llama7B without catastrophic forgetting... by just adding layers lol
  - gives it a nice tradeoff between language and code tasks  ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b5bbe5df-d1fa-42c0-8057-8baee739865f.png?w=960&fit=max) 

But it is getting some scrutiny already for basing on  LlaMA and [not using Mistral/Qwen/etc](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/1743421078649643407?s=20):

- **Discussion on generating answers to multiple choice questions**: Researcher `@Nish` from the University of Maryland started a conversation around discrepancies he noted in his project that uses Language Learning Models (LLMs) to generate answers to multiple choice questions in standard MC format. He reported experiencing a significant performance gap compared to the reported numbers on the leaderboard, particularly for the HellaSwag dataset. 
- **Possible causes for the performance gap**: `@hailey_schoelkopf` suggested that the gap could be due to differences in the implementation, where `@Nish` is having the model generate just the answer letter, and Eleuther's implementation scores the sequence probability of the letter and the text after the letter. As an additional contributing factor, she mentioned the normalization of the choices' log likelihoods, which can significantly impact performance, especially for the HellaSwag dataset.
- **Benchmarking unnormalized vs normalized scores**: `@Nish` was directed by `@stellaathena` and `@hailey_schoelkopf` to [Teknium's github library](https://github.com/teknium1/LLM-Benchmark-Logs/blob/main/benchmark-logs/Mixtral-7x8-Base.md) that contains benchmark logs for different LLMs, to view both unnormalized and normalized scores.
- **Worries about sequence length warnings**: User `@chromecast56` raised concerns about sequence length warnings they were seeing, and asked if intervention was necessary or if the evaluation harness will handle it.
- **ToxiGen's contribution to lm-evaluation-harness**: `@hailey_schoelkopf` mentioned that despite the original ToxiGen paper not exploring the autoregressive language model setting, the novel implementation in the lm-eval-harness was contributed by the ToxiGen lead author.

- **Debate on Causality in LLMs and Diffusion Models**: `@JH` provided a thorough explanation of how **Language and Image Models (LLMs)** can learn causality due to their decoder-based architecture and causal attention mask. In contrast, diffusion models are seen to learn through association rather than causality. This doesn't necessarily prevent them from learning causality, although their architecture and training may not directly bias them towards such a task. One possible way to train diffusion models to learn causality could be by creating datasets that deconstruct a caption from an explicit description to a **causal** one. 
- **Curiosity About Diffusion Models' Understanding of 3D Space**: `@phryq` asked if diffusion models understand that a profile face is just a face positioned differently, representing an interest in the model’s understanding of 3D space.

Created by user **PatrickJS** (also known as [gdi2290](https://socket.dev/npm/user/gdi2290)), the package depends on all other public NPM packages. This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack for anyone attempting to install it due to the behemoth amount of transitive dependencies. The extent of the disruption can be viewed at http://everything.npm.lol. The reaction to this chaos was minimal, with only `@venadore` remarking on the situation as being "**incredible**".
