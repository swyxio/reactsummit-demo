With pricing for 2.5 Flash seemingly chosen to be exactly on the line between 2.0 Flash and 2.5 Pro, it seems that the predictiveness of the Price-Elo chart since [it debuted on this newsletter last year](https://x.com/Smol_AI/status/1838663719536201790) has reached its pinnacle usefulness, after being quoted by [Jeff](https://video.ethz.ch/speakers/d-infk/2025/spring/251-0100-00L.html) and [Demis](https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1908301867672560087).

Gemini 2.5 Flash introduces a new "thinking budget" that offers a bit more control over the Anthropic and OpenAI equivalents, though it is debatable whether THIS level of control is that useful (vs "low/medium/high"):

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama Recap


## 1. Novel LLM Model Launches and Benchmarks (BLT, Local, Mind-Blown Updates)

- **[BLT model weights just dropped - 1B and 7B Byte-Latent Transformers released!](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1hm53)** ([Score: 157, Comments: 39](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k1hm53/blt_model_weights_just_dropped_1b_and_7b/)): **Meta FAIR has released weights for their Byte-Latent Transformer (BLT) models at both 1B and 7B parameter sizes ([link](https://github.com/facebookresearch/blt/pull/97)), as announced in their recent paper ([arXiv:2412.09871](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09871)) and blog update ([Meta AI blog](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-fair-updates-perception-localization-reasoning/)). BLT models are designed for efficient sequence modeling, working directly on byte sequences and utilizing latent variable inference to reduce computational cost while maintaining competitive performance to standard Transformers on NLP tasks. The released models enable reproducibility and further innovation in token-free and efficient language model research.** There are no substantive technical debates or details in the top comments—users are requesting clarification and making non-technical remarks.

  - There's interest in whether consumer hardware can run the 1B or 7B BLT model checkpoints, leading to questions about memory and inference requirements compared to more standard architectures like Llama or GPT. Technical readers want details on hardware prerequisites, performance benchmarks, or efficient inference strategies for at-home use.
  - A user asks if Llama 4 used BLT (Byte-Latent Transformer) architecture or combined layers in that style, suggesting technical curiosity about architectural lineage and whether cutting-edge models like Llama 4 adopted any BLT components. Further exploration would require concrete references to published model cards or architecture notes.

- **[Medium sized local models already beating vanilla ChatGPT - Mind blown](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k1av1x/medium_sized_local_models_already_beating_vanilla/)** ([Score: 242, Comments: 111](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k1av1x/medium_sized_local_models_already_beating_vanilla/)): **A user benchmarked the open-source local model Gemma 3 27B (with IQ3_XS quantization, fitting on 16GB VRAM) against the original ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo), finding that Gemma slightly surpasses GPT-3.5 in daily advice, summarization, and creative writing tasks. The post notes a significant performance leap from early LLaMA models, highlighting that medium-sized (8-30B) local models can now match or exceed earlier state-of-the-art closed models, demonstrating that practical, high-quality LLM inference is now possible on commodity hardware. References: [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma), [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/).** A top comment highlights that the bar for satisfaction is now GPT-4-level performance, while another notes that despite improvements, multilingual capability and fluency still lag behind English in local models.

  - There is discussion about the performance gap between local models (8-32B parameters) and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. While some local models offer impressive results in English, their fluency and knowledge decrease significantly in other languages, indicating room for improvement in multilingual capabilities and factual recall for 8-14B models in particular.
  - A user shares practical benchmarking of running Gemma3 27B and QwQ 32B at Q8 quantization. They note QwQ 32B (at Q8, with specific generation parameters) delivers more elaborate and effective brainstorming than the current free tier models of ChatGPT and Gemini 2.5 Pro, suggesting that with optimal quantization and parameter tuning, locally run large models can approach or surpass cloud-based models in specific creative tasks.
  - Detailed inference parameters are provided for running QwQ 32B—temperature 0.6, top-k 40, repeat penalty 1.1, min-p 0.0, dry-multiplier 0.5, and samplers sequence. The use of InfiniAILab/QwQ-0.5B as a draft model demonstrates workflow optimizations for local generation quality.


## 2. Open-Source LLM Ecosystem: Local Use and Licensing (Llama 2, Gemma, JetBrains)

- **[Forget DeepSeek R2 or Qwen 3, Llama 2 is clearly our local savior.](https://i.redd.it/2668luheaave1.png)** ([Score: 257, Comments: 43](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k0z1bk/forget_deepseek_r2_or_qwen_3_llama_2_is_clearly/)): **The image presents a bar chart comparing various AI models on the 'Humanity's Last Exam (Reasoning & Knowledge)' benchmark. Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest score at 17.1%, followed by o3-ruan (high) at 12.3%. Llama 2, highlighted as the 'local savior,' records a benchmark score of 5.8%, outperforming models like CTRL+ but trailing newer models such as Claude 3-instant and DeepSeek R1. The benchmark appears to be extremely challenging, reflected in the relatively low top scores.** A commenter emphasizes the difficulty of the benchmark, stating that the exam's questions are extremely challenging and even domain experts would struggle to achieve a high score. Another links to a video ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA-ZWQAWr9o)) showing Llama 2 taking the benchmark, suggesting further context or scrutiny.

  - Some commenters express skepticism about Llama 2's benchmark results, questioning whether there might be evaluation errors, mislabeling, or possible overfitting (potentially via leaked test data). One user says, "It is impossible for a 7b model to perform this well," highlighting the disbelief at the level of performance achieved by a model of this size.
  - There's a discussion of the difficulty of the benchmark questions, with the claim that "only top experts can hope to answer the questions that are in their field." This suggests that a 20% success rate on such a benchmark is an impressive result for an AI model—higher than most humans could achieve without specialized expertise, emphasizing Llama 2's capability on challenging, expert-level tasks.
  - A link is provided to a YouTube video of Llama 2 taking the benchmark test, which may be useful for technical readers interested in direct demonstration and further analysis of the model's performance under test conditions.

- **[JetBrains AI now has local llms integration and is free with unlimited code completions](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k14k6a)** ([Score: 206, Comments: 35](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k14k6a/jetbrains_ai_now_has_local_llms_integration_and/)): **JetBrains has introduced a significant update to its AI Assistant for IDEs, granting **free, unlimited code completions and local LLM integration** in all non-Community editions. The update supports new cloud models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.0) and features such as advanced RAG-based context awareness and multi-file Edit mode, with a new subscription model for scaling access to enhanced features ([changelog](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/whatsnew/)). Local LLM integration enables on-device inference for lower-latency, privacy-preserving completions.** Top comments highlight that the free tier excludes the Community edition, question the veracity of unlimited local LLM completions, and compare JetBrains' offering unfavorably to VSCode's Copilot integration, noting plugin issues and decreased usage of JetBrains IDEs.

  - JetBrains AI's local LLM integration is not available on the free Community edition, restricting unlimited local completions to paid versions (e.g., Ultimate, Pro), as confirmed in [this screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/73k1heedrbve1.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&s=7243ab453e8a64aea0812cc5efc8c8f3626eb829).
  - The current release allows connections to local LLMs via an OpenAI-compatible API, but there is a limitation: you cannot connect to private, on-premises LLM deployments when they require authentication. Future updates may address this gap, but enterprise users relying on secure, internal models are currently unsupported.
  - There is confusion over JetBrains AI's credit system, as details about the meaning and practical translation of "M" (for Pro plan) and "L" (for Ultimate plan) credits are undocumented. This makes it difficult for users to estimate operational costs or usage limits for non-local LLM features.

- **[Gemma's license has a provision saying "you must make "reasonable efforts to use the latest version of Gemma"](https://i.redd.it/pn9z3hg67dve1.png)** ([Score: 203, Comments: 57](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k18pb4/gemmas_license_has_a_provision_saying_you_must/)): **The image presents a highlighted excerpt from the Gemma model's license agreement (Section 4: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS), which mandates that users must make 'reasonable efforts to use the latest version of Gemma.' This clause gives Google a means to minimize risk or liability from older versions that might generate problematic content by encouraging (but not strictly enforcing) upgrades. The legal phrasing ('reasonable efforts') is intentionally ambiguous, offering flexibility but potentially complicating compliance for users and downstream projects.** One top comment speculates this clause is to shield Google from issues with legacy models producing harmful outputs. Other comments criticize the clause as unenforceable or impractical, highlighting user reluctance or confusion about what constitutes 'reasonable efforts.'

  - The provision requiring users to make "reasonable efforts to use the latest version of Gemma" may serve as a legal safeguard for Google. This could allow Google to distance itself from potential liability caused by older versions generating problematic content, essentially encouraging prompt patching as a matter of license compliance.
  - A technical examination of the license documents reveals inconsistencies: the clause in question appears in the Ollama-distributed version (see [Ollama's blob](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3/blobs/dd084c7d92a3)), but not in Google's official [Gemma license terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms) distributed via Huggingface. The official license's Section 4.1 only mentions that "Google may update Gemma from time to time." This discrepancy suggests either a mistaken copy-paste or derivation from a different (possibly API) version of the license.


## 3. AI Industry News: DeepSeek, Wikipedia-Kaggle Dataset, Qwen 3 Hype

- **[Trump administration reportedly considers a US DeepSeek ban](https://i.redd.it/80uc8c906bve1.jpeg)** ([Score: 458, Comments: 218](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k12i6l/trump_administration_reportedly_considers_a_us/)): **The image depicts the DeepSeek logo alongside a news article discussing the Trump administration's reported consideration of banning DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, from accessing Nvidia AI chips and restricting its AI services in the U.S. This move, detailed in recent TechCrunch and NYT articles, is positioned within ongoing U.S.-China competition in AI and semiconductor technology. The reported restriction could have major implications for technological exchange, chip supply chains, and access to advanced AI models in the U.S. market.** Commenters debate the regulatory logic, questioning how practices like model distillation could be selectively enforced (particularly given ongoing copyright controversies in training data). There's skepticism over enforceability, and some argue such moves would push innovation and open source development further outside the U.S. ecosystem.

  - Readers debate the legality and enforceability of banning model distillation, questioning OpenAI's reported argument and its consistency with claims that training on copyrighted data is legal. The skepticism includes the technicality that trivial model modifications (e.g., altering a single weight and renaming the model) could theoretically circumvent such a ban, highlighting the challenge of enforcing intellectual property controls on open-source AI models.
  - Historical comparisons are made to US restrictions on cryptography prior to 1996, with one commenter arguing that the US government has previously treated software (including arbitrary numbers, as in encrypted binaries) as munitions, suggesting that AI model weights could receive similar treatment. The practical impact of bans is mentioned: while pirating model weights may be possible, model adoption would be hampered if major inference hardware or hosting platforms refused support.
  - The question of infrastructure resilience is raised: if US-based platforms (like HuggingFace) are barred from hosting DeepSeek weights, international hosting could provide continued access. The technical and jurisdictional distribution of hosting infrastructure is cited as key for ensuring ongoing availability of open-source AI models in the face of regulatory pressures.

- **[Wikipedia is giving AI developers its data to fend off bot scrapers - Data science platform Kaggle is hosting a Wikipedia dataset that’s specifically optimized for machine learning applications](https://i.redd.it/d044iigqrdve1.jpeg)** ([Score: 506, Comments: 71](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k1ahr4/wikipedia_is_giving_ai_developers_its_data_to/)): **Wikipedia, in partnership with Kaggle, has released a new structured dataset specifically for machine learning applications, available in English and French and formatted as well-structured JSON to ease modeling, benchmarking, and NLP pipeline development. The dataset, covered under CC-BY-SA 4.0 and GFDL licenses, aims to provide a legal and optimized alternative to scraping and unstructured dumps, making it more accessible to smaller developers without significant data engineering resources.

## 1. OpenAI o3 and o4-mini Model Benchmarks and User Experiences

- **[WHAT!! OpenAI strikes back. o3 is  pretty much perfect in long context comprehension.](https://i.redd.it/kw13sjo4ieve1.jpeg)** ([Score: 769, Comments: 169](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1k1df3c/what_openai_strikes_back_o3_is_pretty_much/)): **The post shares a benchmark table (https://i.redd.it/kw13sjo4ieve1.jpeg) from Fiction.LiveBench, assessing multiple LLMs' (large language models) long-context comprehension across input lengths up to 120k tokens. OpenAI's 'o3' model stands out, scoring a consistent 100.0 at shorter contexts (0-4k), maintaining high performance at 32k (83.3), and uniquely recovering a perfect score (100.0) at 120k, surpassing all listed competitors such as Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama-3-70B, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Other models display more fluctuation and generally lower scores as context length increases, indicating o3's superior long-context grained retention and reasoning.** Commenters note the need for higher context benchmarks beyond 120k tokens and question why 'o3' and Gemini 2.5 perform anomalously well at 120k compared to 16k, speculating about possible evaluation quirks or model-specific optimizations for extreme long contexts.

  - A technical concern is that although o3 reportedly handles 120k token contexts well, the benchmark itself caps at 120k, limiting the depth of assessment for long-context comprehension. There is a call for increasing benchmark context limits past 120k to truly evaluate models like o3 and Gemini 2.5.
  - One user notes a practical limitation: despite claims of strong performance in long-context windows (up to 120k tokens), the OpenAI web interface restricts input to around 64k tokens, frequently producing a 'message too long' error, which constrains real-world usability for Pro users.
  - A technical question is raised about why models like o3 and Gemini 2.5 sometimes appear to perform better at 120k tokens than at shorter context windows like 16k, prompting interest in the dynamics of context window performance and potential architectural or training causes for this counterintuitive result.

- **[o3 thought for 14 minutes and gets it painfully wrong.](https://i.redd.it/fnazpzfyaave1.jpeg)** ([Score: 1403, Comments: 402](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1k0z2qs/o3_thought_for_14_minutes_and_gets_it_painfully/)): **The image documents a failure case wherein ChatGPT's vision model (referred to as o3) is tasked with counting rocks in an image. Despite 'thinking' for nearly 14 minutes, it incorrectly concludes there are 30 rocks, while a commenter states there are 41. This highlights ongoing limitations in current AI vision models for precise object counting even with extended inference time.** Commenters point out the inaccuracy—one provides the correct answer (41 rocks), and another expresses skepticism but suggests the error was plausible, underscoring persistent doubts about AI reliability in such perceptual tasks. Another user shares a comparison with Gemini 2.5 Pro, indicating broader interest in benchmarking these vision models.

  - The image comparisons shared by users (e.g., with Gemini 2.5 Pro) imply that large language models (LLMs) or multimodal models like O3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrate significant struggles with even simple visual counting tasks, such as determining the number of objects (rocks) in an image. This indicates persistent limitations in basic visual quantitative reasoning for current models from leading AI labs. 
  - The discussion indirectly references the inappropriate or mismatched application of models for tasks outside their skill domain, as one user notes, likening an AI's failure to use a "hammer" for a "cutting" job—suggesting that relying on LLMs or multi-modal models for precise visual counting may not align with their design strengths. This points to a need for specialized architectures or more training for such tasks rather than expecting generalist models to master all domains immediately.

> `Ask Mode Persistence, O4-mini Error Fix, Copy-Context Usage, Cloud Aider Instances, Architect & Edit Format Split`

- **Ask Mode Persists with** `/chat-mode ask`: Users can use `/chat-mode ask` to persistently stay in ASK mode, but this can be confusing, because the help menu says *"switch to a new chat mode"* instead of *"switch to a* ***different*** *chat mode"*.
  
  - It was suggested that specifying `ask` as the default mode in the config file should also make it persist, and typing `/ask` alone and pressing enter will also switch to ask mode, as per the [documentation](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/modes.html).
- **O4-mini Temperature Error Resolved**: An error with **o4-mini** (*Unsupported value: 'temperature' does not support 0 with this model*) was reported, and resolved by upgrading to the [latest version](https://aider.chat/docs/version_history.html).
  
  - The user was on v0.74.1 and Paul G. confirmed that the latest version supports **o4-mini**.
- **Streamlining Copy-Context in ChatGPT**: A user inquired about the best way to paste `copy-context` output into **ChatGPT** for optimal results, including the preferred model (e.g., gemini-flash).
  
  - A screenshot showed the chat gpt **o4-mini** running in aider with **4o-mini**, but no optimal method for pasting into ChatGPT was specified.
- **Aider Instance in the Cloud**: A user asked about running an **aider instance** in the cloud and sending prompts through a workflow.
  
  - Another user confirmed they were doing this, and asked the original poster to DM them.
- **Splitting Architect & Edit Formats**: A user asked about splitting the edit format for the **architect** and **edit** functions, and whether this pulls from `.aider.model.settings.yml`.
  
  - It was suggested to configure `edit_format: diff` for the normal edits and `editor_edit_format: editor-diff` for the architect mode, referencing the [code](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider/blob/main/aider/coders/architect_coder.py).

> `CondenseQuestionChatEngine Tool Support, Anthropic Bedrock Prompt Caching, Anthropic support with LlamaIndex`

- **CondenseQuestionChatEngine Does Not Support Tools**: The **CondenseQuestionChatEngine** does not support calling tools; the suggestion was made to use an **agent** instead, according to a member.
  
  - Another member confirmed it was just a suggestion and was not actually implemented.
- **Bedrock Converse Prompt Caching Conundrums**: A member using **Anthropic** through **Bedrock Converse** faced issues using prompt caching, encountering an error when adding *extra_headers* to the *llm.acomplete* call.
  
  - After removing the extra headers, the error disappeared, but the response lacked the expected fields indicating prompt caching, such as *cache_creation_input_tokens*.
- **Anthropic Class recommended to support Bedrock**: It was suggested that the *Bedrock Converse integration* might need an update to properly support prompt caching, due to differences in how it places the cache point, and that the `Anthropic` class should be used instead.
  
  - The suggestion was based on the member testing with plain **Anthropic**, and pointed to a [Google Colab notebook example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wolX4dd2NheesiThKrr5HZh4xebFc0lq?usp=sharing) as a reference.

> `MLIR in Mojo, Mojo Dict Pointer Behavior, FP languages optimizations`

- **Dialect Dilemma in Mojo**: A user encountered an error trying to use the `arith.constant` MLIR operation in Mojo, discovering that Mojo doesn't expose standard dialects like `arith` by default, with only the `llvm` dialect available.
  
  - It was clarified that there are currently *no mechanisms to register other dialects* in Mojo.
- **Pointer Shenanigans with Mojo Dictionaries**: A user observed unexpected `copy` and `move` behavior when retrieving a pointer to a dictionary value in Mojo using `Dict[Int, S]()` and `d.get_ptr(1)`.
  
  - The user's code produced copy/move operations even after the initial move, leading them to ask: *"Why is retrieving a pointer to a dict value invoking a copy and a move? 🤯 Is this intended behaviour by any means?"*
- **Optimizing Overhead in Functional Programming Languages**: A user expressed skepticism regarding the ability to optimize away all the overhead typically associated with Functional Programming (FP) languages in Mojo.
  
  - This concern was raised in the context of a *"neat project"*, hinting at ongoing efforts to address this challenge.
