> `Meta Model Safety Downgrades, Decoding 'venom' Prompts, Gemini 2.5 Pro's 'Aliveness', New LMArena models` 


- **Meta Models Get a "Safety" Downgrade**: Newer models from Meta are reportedly becoming *safer*, with one member noting the shift by testing how the AI infers hidden context from corrupted text and observing that the models now apparently sanitize the **censored details**.
   - In contrast, previous models like **Themis**, **Cybele**, and **Spider** were *eager to go where other models couldn't*.
- **Decoding the "Venom" Prompt: A System Prompt Analysis**: Members analyzed the system prompt for models like **Spider**, **Cybele**, and **Themis**, believing they share a similar prompt to the now exposed [`venom`](https://gist.github.com/riidefi/3340cc2b33b9edf5f03dc4429ba635d0) prompt.
   - The analysis reveals a *whacky but intelligently crafted* prompt that heavily influences the models' style and responses, particularly in how they format and structure their outputs.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro's Spooky "Aliveness" Sparks Turing Test Debates**: Members express intrigue over the *aliveness* and *curiosity* of **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, with one suggesting it *might be the first to pass a serious Turing Test* due to its unique interaction style.
   - They highlight **Gemini's** exceptional creative writing capabilities and top scores on **Philip's SimpleBench** as evidence of its potential and note the model appears to be more creative and engaging, leading to calls for a double-blind **Turing Test**.
- **LMArena Introduces a Pantheon of New Models**: LMArena introduces a flood of anonymous models like **Aether**, **Maverick**, **Ray**, **Stargazer**, **Riveroaks**, with members trying to uncover their origins and capabilities.
   - **Stargazer** is said to be made by Google (=== **Nebula**), and  **Riveroaks** claims to be from OpenAI, gpt 4o, while **Maverick**, **Spider** and **24_karat_gold** seem to have a similar style due to their shared system prompts and origins at Meta.

> `Blackwell Support, VLM Training, GRPO Usage, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Training with Unsloth` 


- **RTX Pro 6000 gets PyTorch Support**: A user asked about **Blackwell support** and mentioned having an **RTX Pro 6000** with **CUDA 12.8** and **sm_120** to finetune **Mistral**.
   - Another user replied that PyTorch nightly supports it, but recompiling everything is required.
- **RAG Reward Ruminations**: A user asked about using **GRPO** for **RAG** or similar variants with tools, and how to reward that.
   - Another user outlined primary reward components, including **retrieval quality rewards** (relevance, diversity, accuracy), **generation quality rewards** (factual consistency, citation accuracy, completeness), and **tool usage rewards** (appropriate selection, correct usage, effective incorporation).
- **Unsloth's Training Precision Pointers**: In a discussion about training speed and precision, it was stated that **16-bit LoRA** is the most precise and fastest if **VRAM** is not limited, and that **Unsloth** has optimizations for 16-bit.
   - It was also suggested to benchmark both **4-bit** and **8-bit** to see the difference and gain practical experience.
- **Multi-GPU Marvels Incoming**: It was revealed that multi-GPU support is coming soon to **Unsloth**.
   - The first release will likely include only data parallelism, and fsdp (Fully Sharded Data Parallelism) may not be included initially and will be under the AGPL3 license.
- **DeepSeek Training Trials**: One member lamented that they *can't train on deepseek!*
   - It may require two nodes of **H100s** to train **DeepSeek**, even with **QLoRA**.

> `Lightweight Pretraining Techniques, Bonsai pretraining, BitNet training Costs, Qwen Model Rebenched, Exllama2 vs vLLM Inference` 


- **Investigating SOTA Lightweight Pretraining for 64-GPU alternative**: A member suggested investigating **SOTA lightweight pretraining techniques** (MoE, FP8) to achieve pretraining with a single node in a couple of weeks instead of 64 GPUs.
   - They shared a [link to deepgrove-ai/Bonsai](https://github.com/deepgrove-ai/Bonsai) suggesting it might be possible to pretrain with *only $70 and 3.8b tokens on a BitNet*.
- **DeepGrove's Bonsai Claims $70 BitNet Pretraining**: A member expressed skepticism about [DeepGrove's Bonsai](https://github.com/deepgrove-ai/Bonsai) claim of pretraining a **BitNet** with *only $70 and 3.8b tokens*.
   - They are running the model in Kaggle to see if it holds up and explore possibilities of the model being *a blindly copied Qwen model* or *continue trained Qwen to BitNet*.
- **BitNet Verification Challenges Explored**: A member shared a code snippet for a **modified weight quantization** to determine if a model is based on **BitNet** architecture.
   - The code uses per-tensor quantization to 1.58 bits, with no grouping needed for quantization.
- **Fastest inference engine debate: exllama2 vs vLLM**: A member asked about the fastest inference engine for single request non-batched decoding for Llama / Mistral 4bit quants, particularly comparing **Sglang/lmdeploy** and **vLLM**.
   - The member assumes **vLLM** might not perform well in non-batched decoding due to its engine needing to go through llm_engine.step().
- **TurboDerp's exllama2's Dynamic Mode Explored**: A member shared the [exllama2's dynamic mode link](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav2/blob/master/doc/dynamic.md), noting all forward calls go through the generator, requiring control handoff to the generator job scheduling.
   - Other members suggest **TensorRT LLM** for single token generation, while some suggest *hooking the forward pass in exllama*.

> `Orpheus Dataset Issues, Model Evaluation Problems, Gemma 3 Inference Samples, Fine-tuning with PDFs, Vision Fine-tuning with Gemma 3` 


- **Dataset causes value error**: A user encountered a `ValueError: expected sequence of length 203 at dim 1 (got 885)` when using a custom dataset in **Unsloth Orpheus** format, later resolving it by using a GPU.
   - Another user mentioned that the **Orpheus dataset** uses **SNAC**, which operates at **24kHz**.
- **Model Evaluation Incoherence Surfaces**: A user reported experiencing issues during model evaluation, with the model generating incoherent text despite coherent text generation during normal inference runs.
   - It was suggested that enabling `report_to` can help log metrics to platforms like **Wandb**, especially when using a custom `compute_metrics` function.
- **Gemma 3 does Text-to-Image!**: A user asked for image and text inference samples for **Unsloth/Gemma 3** using Hugging Face, referencing a [Gemma 3 demo on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/gemma-3-12b-it).
   - It was noted that while **Llama 3.2 Vision** requires an image, **Gemma 3** should not have the same issue.
- **Turning PDFs into Chatbots, Dataprep needed**: A user sought guidance on fine-tuning a model using only documents (PDFs) to specialize in a language or field, after converting the PDFs to text using **Langchain**.
   - It was suggested to use synthetic data generation via *augmentoolkit*, emphasizing that this process is outside the scope of **Unsloth** and that they should look at [Unsloth docs](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/continued-pretraining).
- **Mamba Gains Eager Attention**: Users discovered a fix for **Mamba** implementation issues by setting `attn_implementation = "eager"`, as highlighted in a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/pull/2263).
   - Despite the fix, **Mamba** training was noted to be significantly slower.

> `Model Evaluation, Coding benchmarks, Long context benchmarks, Math benchmarks, Gemma 3 vs small LMs` 


- **General performance benchmarks non-existent**: A member stated that there is no such thing as general performance benchmark and every model is good/bad at a set of different verticals.
   - They said *it's like a fallacy to believe that by aggregating a bunch of verticals together you'll get a score result that satisfies your particular vertical*.
- **Coding benchmarks: Aider Polyglot and SWE Bench**: For coding benchmarks, a member suggested **Aider Polyglot** and **SWE Bench** as decently applicable benchmarks.
   - However, **SWE Bench** has issues with being based on llm frameworks, and **Aider Polyglot** might show how good an llm is when you use it with aider.
- **RULER is bare minimum for Long Ctx Bench**: For long ctx benches, a member stated that **RULER** is the bare minimum for what should be considered a long ctx bench, and **NIAH** is garbage.
   - They added that some of the recent ones are alright.
- **Math Benchmarks: AIME is good enough**: For math benchmarks, a member suggested that **AIME** is good enough as long as there's no contamination and there is proper assessment with COT.
   - They also mentioned that most coding benches are based on python, but there's **WebDev Arena** for JS.
- **Small LMs vs Gemma 3**: A member expressed interest in comparing **Gemma-3 4B** with existing small LMs.
   - They asked if **Open LLM** doesn't have **Gemma 3**, are there any other viable leaderboards containing **Gemma 3** against small LMs.

> `Space Instructions limitations, Image generation discontinued?, Apple Intelligence in the EU, Samsung AI vs Apple Intelligence, GPT Omni shortcomings` 


- **Space Instructions offer limited control, members discover**: Users discussed that [**Space Instructions**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/space-instructions-limitations-FuW7yKXsTQGFp71t55f1Bg) in Perplexity AI do not provide full control over the search experience, mainly affecting output summarization rather than initial data sourcing.
   - The limitation means instructions cannot prevent the AI from searching specific topics, as instructions only apply *after* the relevant data has already been extracted, causing frustration among some users.
- **Perplexity Image Generation: Missing in Action?**: A user inquired about the discontinuation of **image creation** within Perplexity, noting the feature's absence.
   - Another user suggested using the *web search* to find the generate option, but another confirmed that the function doesn't seem to appear for everyone, perhaps indicating phased rollout or feature testing.
- **Apple Intelligence Blocked from EU?**: A user casually noted *yey apple intelligence in the EU now*, implying availability, though without further elaboration.
   - Following the statement, others swiftly shifted the focus to discussing **Samsung AI**, with one user claiming it's superior, triggering a debate on the merits of each.
- **Perplexity Users Grumble About GPT Omni**: Users expressed dissatisfaction with **GPT Omni**, with one describing it as *suck ass* and questioning how to revert to a previous **GPT** version.
   - Another user explained that **Omni** is designed for smarter interaction with audio, video, and images, but has been *dumbed down* compared to **GPT-4** for cost reasons.
- **Rumors abound: Perplexity to launch more Deep Research**: A Perplexity team member hinted at an upcoming, *more powerful version* of **Deep Research** in the coming weeks.
   - Speculations include a potential partnership with **Groq**, following the addition of text, but not the actual new deep research feature; users report that **Deep Research** completes in seconds instead of minutes.

- **Beware! ChatGPT Impersonators Swarm Play Store**: Users reported buying **ChatGPT** through the Play Store but not receiving access, raising concerns about fake impersonator apps, and urging users to check their [purchase history](https://help.openai.com) to confirm it was with **OpenAI**.
   - It's important to ensure you're using the official app to avoid scams and ensure you have access to **OpenAI** services.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Hits Rate Limits**: Users are reporting getting rate limited on **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, sparking discussion of whether the limit applies to both free and paid tiers, some users bypass rate limits by using a **VPN**.
   - It was suggested to use **Gemini** in [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) where the limits are higher (50 per day).
- **Ghibli Style Conversions Tickle AI Image Generators**: Members experimented with prompts to convert images to **Ghibli** style, one user shared their prompt *"Make this image gibli style"*, while another suggested *"Reimagine this image in the iconic Studio Ghibli style: painterly textures, soft light, and a touch of nostalgic wonder"*.
   - The free models were used, but it was noted more improvements are needed to detail emotions and face details, with some claiming they are **far better than destroying Ghibli art style for nothing**.
- **ElevenLabs New Voice Model: Promising but Pricey?**: A member shared that they are exploring [ElevenLabs' new model](https://elevenlabs.io/) for creating narrated audio books, highlighting its voice cloning feature.
   - While impressed with initial results and high quality, they await **OpenAI** to release a similar voice product to avoid subscribing to external services, as for some game developers, it could be useful as a voice acting placeholder.
- **Navigating AI's Role in Creative Industries: a Tightrope Walk**: The discussion touched on the use of **AI** in creative fields, particularly gaming, with the consensus that **AI** is often used by non-creatives, resulting in amateurish outputs and overestimation of **AI's** current capabilities, they referenced [this discussion](https://discord.com/channels/974519864045756446/1355653770603925806).
   - There was an exchange of opinions, with some arguing that **AI** is mostly assisting professionals for ideation, while others critiqued reliance on statistically average outputs and the need for human effort in creating novel works. AI integration into existing software ecosystems like **Adobe** and **Autodesk** was seen as a more promising direction.

> `Image generation rate limits, copilot experiences, ChatGPT instructions, 4o abilities, future of image model` 


- **OpenAI implements image generation rate limits for Plus users**: Due to extreme load since the new image model was released, Plus users are now experiencing [rate limits](https://www.google.com/search?q=openai+rate+limits), an interim measure to mitigate the flood of users.
   - One user, presumably facetiously, remarked, *"At $200 a month you better not get rate limited,"* referencing a story that OpenAI added **1 million new users in an hour**.
- **Users adapt to copilot**: A member shared feeling adapting to copilot, when copilot is *"something dumb over and over"*.
   - The member expressed a feeling of adaptation while using **copilot**.
- **Users seeking guidance on ChatGPT Prompting**: A user sought help to prevent **ChatGPT** from adding *"cool or edgy"* concluding remarks to its descriptions.
   - Another member suggested a revised prompt, including the line: *"Do not add concluding remarks outside the direct scope of fulfilling the request based on the chosen purpose. Stick to the process."*
- **Experimenting photo editing with 4o abilities**: A user suggested a mode for editing photos or setting a custom vibe in **4o**, preloading context with a game of **20 questions** to narrow in on obscure human touches.
   - The idea suggests leveraging **4o's** ability to read between the lines for better follow-up requests and a personalized experience.
- **Debating the Future of Image Model Improvements**: A member asked whether OpenAI will continue to improve the image model or leave it for a few years, similar to what they did with **DALL-E**.
   - No concrete answers were provided, but the question sparks curiosity about OpenAI's future plans for image generation technology.

> `Custom Instructions in 'About Me' Box, Memory-Stored Prompts, Personalization in Model Responses, Model Pattern Recognition and Formatting` 


- **Custom Instructions Work in 'About Me' Box**: A member confirmed that extending custom instructions into the 'About Me' box works perfectly, as *information is information to the model*.
   - Another member noted that the model can figure out likely patterns in your intent and *runs with it*, even if the fields are split mid-sentence.
- **RAG-only context limits 'About me' Box**: A member questioned whether the 'About Me' box gets confined to some **RAG-only context-dependent space** and whether it's reliable for storing entire prompts.
   - They also mentioned having a ridiculous amount of memories and have tried to fit entire prompts into them, but it doesn’t seem very reliable. And that memory-stored prompts or personas do not activate without specifically requesting them.
- **Personalization May Not Always Be Evident**: A member shared examples of personalized model responses and noted that the first response may not always reflect their personalization.
   - They emphasized being very clear about what they want and don't want from the model, including specifications for tool usage and NPC behavior.
- **Model Learns To Reset Rigid Patterns**: A member shared a code snippet `FORMAT_RESET` to help models acknowledge when they've fallen into rigid patterns and rethink their approach.
   - The code encourages the model to analyze what format would better suit the response and completely rethink its approach without defaulting to templates.

> `Custom instructions in 'about me' box, Memory-stored prompts, Model Guessing vs Training, FORMAT_RESET for rigid patterns` 


- **About Me as Custom Instructions?**: A member asked if extending the custom instructions into the *about me* box works, and another member confirmed that it works perfectly because the model uses it as additional information to work with.
   - The model can figure out a likely pattern in your intent and runs with it, even if you split the field mid-sentence; there is no functional reason it wouldn’t work unless “about me” gets confined to some RAG-only context-dependent space.
- **Memory-stored prompts unreliable?**: A member noted they have a ridiculous amount of memories, and while they have tried to fit entire prompts into them, it doesn’t seem very reliable.
   - They can’t get **memory-stored prompts or personas to activate** without specifically requesting them, leading them to think the model is not actually seeing them most of the time or they are a much lower priority than where custom instructions are placed in the model context; [shared chat examples of prompt engineering and NPC generation](https://chatgpt.com/share/67eb2cb0-b41c-8011-abee-88bfe2abc478).
- **Model Guessing vs Training**: One member shared their process by presuming that the model either guesses a lot, leading to variation, OR it was trained to output in a typical pattern which was not specifically asked for, OR it is doing exactly what was asked for.
   - Conflicts are mandatory to find and fix, as they usually degrade the performance, particularly when the model is trained that *humans prefer X* but the user prefers otherwise.
- **FORMAT_RESET for rigid patterns!**: A member created a little thing for when you catch a model following a format/pattern you don't like/want, as a way to acknowledge that the model has fallen into rigid patterns and rethink its approach without defaulting to templates.
   - They provided a code snippet to tell the model ```FORMAT_RESET: Acknowledge you've fallen into rigid patterns, analyze what format would better suit your response, and completely rethink your approach without defaulting to templates.```

- **Plug eGPU to LM Studio!**: Members discussed the feasibility of using an **eGPU** with **LM Studio**, suggesting it should work as long as the computer recognizes it, despite slower speeds, referencing a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hi1VoOI00g) comparing LLMs on RTX 4090 Laptop vs Desktop.
- **Gemma 3 Beats Gemini 1.5 Flash**: A member shared a comparison where [**Gemma 3 27B** outperforms **Gemini 1.5 Flash**](https://i.imgur.com/XbmTSd1.png) in several benchmarks, like MMLU-Pro and Bird-SQL.
   - Another member confirmed excellent results with Gemini 2.5 Pro, while another user used Gemini 2.5 Pro to produce the data, available free on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25).
- **Qwen Coder 7B recommended!**: For coding on a system with a **4060 Ti** and **i5 12400F**, **Qwen Coder 7B** was recommended and available on [LM Studio's model page](https://lmstudio.ai/model/qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct), with suggestions to offload most of it to the GPU and also use Qwen Coder 14B or 32B.
   - Members emphasized that a local LLM would perform *much worse* than cloud alternatives like **ChatGPT** or **Deepseek**, but **Gemini 2.0 Flash** was considered a top performer, costing only $0.44 per 1M input tokens according to their [pricing documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing).
- **Copilot's Coding Critiqued!**: Members debated whether **AI assistance** in programming is beneficial, with one arguing that it *hurts more than helps* because the average user learns on *AI slop*.
   - Others disagreed, stating that **Copilot** works great for experienced developers, but one person claims the recommendations given are trusted too easily by the average user, in addition to concern that **copilot is trained on garbage code**.
- **One Parameter LLM Possible?**: In a lighthearted exchange, it was discussed that *a one-parameter LLM is possible but useless*, and one user indicated they *tried 656K but it can't chat though*.

- **Nvidia Drivers Crash After Extended Runtime**: A user reported **Nvidia driver instability** after running models for **10-12 hours**, requiring a driver reinstall to resolve performance issues.
   - The user clarified the issue was with the **Nvidia driver** itself, not the Windows OS, and sought to find if others experienced the same.
- **M4 Max gets Speed Boost vs 5090**: A user observed a **3.24x speedup** from **M4 Max** to **5090** after resolving crashing issues, which aligns with the **3.28x ratio** of their memory bandwidths when doing **QwQ 32B 4 bit quant comparisons**.
   - They're now seeing around **21 tok/s** on **M4 Max** and roughly **60 tok/s** on **5090** when testing **Gemma 3 32B q4**.
- **Mac Freedom of Context Size vs Nvidia Faster GPUs**: While **Nvidia GPUs** may be faster, users are leaning towards **Macs** for the *freedom to have more context size*.
   - The user highlighted that even though NVIDIA GPUs are faster, the *ability to use larger context sizes* is proving to be more useful.
- **Tenstorrent Wormhole results sought out in Discord**: A user inquired about performance results for the **Tenstorrent Wormhole (n150d and n300d)** within the Discord community.
   - They expressed interest in obtaining **TOK/s** metrics for these models, but there was no follow up.
- **Overflowing Context impacts LLM speed**: A user wondered what would happen if they could load the **context overflow** into the shared memory/system RAM while keeping the entire model in VRAM.
   - Another user noted that the **LLM needs all the context in VRAM** to generate the next token, because *for each token generated, all the context goes through the transformer blocks, again and again*.

- ****Gemini 2.5 Pro**: A Hot Mess of Highs and Hallucinations?**: Users are experimenting with **Gemini 2.5 Pro** and reporting mixed results with some models hallucinating/DC'ing while others are providing top-tier performance for coding tasks.
   - One user noted, *"Gemini is hallucinating / dc'd for me, same for you guys?"*, while another stated that the combination of **Gemini 2.5 Pro** and **DeepseekV3** is *"almost free and top tier."
- ****RateLimitError** Woes: Token Limits or Request Frequency?**: A user reported frequent **RateLimitErrors** when requesting summaries and clearing history, and was looking for solutions to automate this process.
   - Paul Gauthier clarified that the rate limit is likely based on the number of requests per minute or day, rather than the token count. One possible solution may be found [in this Github issue](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/issues/2979#issuecomment-2613554537).
- **Dot Command Revolution: Aider's productivity hack?**: A user is trying to promote the use of **.dotcommands** as a productivity hack for developers, enabling them to automate tasks with single-line commands such as `.status` and `.next`.
   - The goal is to provide cognitive shortcuts optimized for clarity and specific functionality, but no one is using them. It has led to the quip *"THE DOT REVOLUTION IS HERE 🔥 Coders everywhere will want to try this one cool trick."
- ****F#**: Condolences or Kudos?**: A user mentioned rebuilding their app from Python into **F#**, prompting mixed reactions, including condolences and suggestions to *"use Haskell"*.
   - While the user explained they were working on ML projects, the community seemed skeptical about the choice of **F#** for such tasks.
- **Video Analysis: Beyond the Transcript**: A user inquired about **AI models' comprehension of videos**, wondering if they understand emotional impact or follow visual storylines beyond just processing transcripts.
   - One response indicated that *"Gemini's video understanding is 1 frame per second of the video fed into the model as an image."*

> `Temperature for coding, Stopping benchmarks, Aider with subdirectories, Aider local config, Model Summarization fails` 


- **The Coder's Icy Preference for Temperature**: Members discussed the optimal "temperature" for coding, with `0` being the popular choice in the channel.
   - A member asked for justification for this value, requesting *is it based on smth*?
- **Aider's Subtree Savior for Mono-Repos**: A member asked how to limit **aider** to a subdirectory of a monorepo, prompting a response to use the `--subtree-only` switch after changing to the desired directory.
   - This sets **aider** to ignore the repo outside the starting directory, though the asker noted the docs need updating and pointed to the [FAQ on large monorepos](https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#can-i-use-aider-in-a-large-mono-repo).
- **Config Conundrums: Model Settings in Aider**: A member reported that specifying model names in a local **YAML** config file wasn't working as expected.
   - Despite the startup message showing the correct config settings, **aider** still defaulted to *anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219* rather than the configured *deepseek/deepseek-chat*.
- **Linting Loops Launching with Aider**: A member inquired about running linters within **aider**, with another suggesting the use of `/run [npm|pnpm] run [lint|fix|whatever-command]` for a tight feedback loop.
   - Another member pointed to the [sample aider.conf.yml](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/blob/3992681b84d1ec0cbc18657c5ca832c89d7e551c/aider/website/assets/sample.aider.conf.yml#L263) file for listing multiple linters.
- **Architect Model Results Get a Promotion**: A member sought a way to directly send a satisfactory response from the architect model to the editor model to conserve **2.5 Pro** shots.
   - The suggestion was to open a new **aider** instance with `--restore-chat-history` and a suitable editor configured, though the lack of a `--no-architect` flag was noted as an inconvenience.

- **Gemini Flash 2 Middle-Out Transforms**: Members confirmed that [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) offers full **1M context** on paid **Gemini Flash 2** requests, with **middle-out transforms** being opt-in and only applied by default on endpoints with context length less than 8192 tokens.
   - One member clarified that *middle out only applies once you hit 1m right? (on flash) even if it's turned on*.
- **Requesting Usage Download**: A member inquired about obtaining downloads of their usage data, including tokens and costs, as displayed on the activity page, to verify their credit usage.
   - A maintainer responded that while this feature isn't currently available, *we're working on it*.
- **OpenRouter Enterprise Level Rate Limits**: A user asked about **enterprise-level rate limits**, clarifying that they disappear with a balance of $500 or more, subject to the upstream provider.
   - Another member chimed in that *well technically it depends upon the upstream provider*.
- **Auto Router for Fallback Models**: A user requested a **fallback model** option, similar to the existing fallback provider feature.
   - Another member pointed out that [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) already has this via the [Auto Router](https://openrouter.ai/openrouter/auto) and the `models` parameter, as detailed in the [documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/model-routing).
- **OpenRouter EU Provider Selection**: A user inquired about selecting providers residing only in the **European Union** due to legal requirements.
   - A maintainer acknowledged the need but noted limited coverage today, mentioning OpenRouter allows provider selection, recommending seeking an **EU certified provider** for strict EU data guidelines.

> `Cosine Annealing LR, Mini-batch vs Batch, Gradient Accumulation, Stanford CS 25 Transformers Course, Category theory` 


- **Debate on Cosine Annealing Learning Rate (LR) Updates**: Discussion on whether **Cosine Annealing LR** is best updated after every **batch** or **sample**, with concerns raised about different samples receiving different training when updating after every sample.
   - The recommendation was to update after every **mini-batch**, ignoring the *exposure problem*, or attempting to fix it.
- **Mini-Batch vs Batch Jargon Jungle**: Members discussed the difference between **mini-batch** and **batch** in machine learning, with the distinction becoming increasingly blurred due to techniques like gradient accumulation and distributed training.
   - It was mentioned that a **mini-batch** is run before each optimizer step, while a **batch** is a set of unique data, but the term *batch size* refers to the size of the **mini-batch**.
- **Gradient Accumulation: Pro or Con?**: Members debated the merits of **gradient accumulation**, with one member recalling it being previously dismissed but now seeing potential advantages in the early stages of training to calibrate optimizer states.
   - Another member noted that **gradient accumulation** can be beneficial when network communications are slower than the compute, but otherwise, it is considered bad.
- **Stanford Launches CS25 Transformers Course to the Public**: Stanford has opened its **CS25 Transformers** seminar course to the public via Zoom, featuring discussions with researchers and covering topics from LLM architectures to creative applications.
   - The course includes lectures, social events, networking sessions, and a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2vE7gbsjzA) for discussions, with past lectures available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNiJRchCzutFw5ItR_Z27CM).
- **Category Theory: Reverse Engineering DL?**: Someone shared a [link](https://x.com/norabelrose/status/1907169483678212292) to a thought experiment on whether **category theory** could be the optimal language for reverse engineering deep learning.
   - The original post argued that neural networks have *embeddings, or meaningful patterns of neuron activation* rather than *representations*.

> `ACL Rebuttals, Deep Sets for Triangle Area, Comparing Language Model Embeddings, Relative Representations, Convergence of Representations in AI` 


- **Reviewers Get Nudged After Rebuttal Submission**: A member asked about sending an extra message to **ACL reviewers** the day after submitting a rebuttal and another member suggested it's reasonable if the rebuttal deadline is closing or if follow-up might take a few days.
   - The original poster planned to follow up that evening, with the deadline being Thursday.
- **Deep Sets Calculate Triangle Area, Yields Zero Insights**: A member shared a link to a paper titled *Deep Sets for the Area of a Triangle* ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22786)), which presents a polynomial formula for triangle area in **Deep Sets** form.
   - The abstract concludes that the project, motivated by questions about computational complexity of n-point statistics in cosmology, gained *no insights of any kind*.
- **Comparing Language Model Embedding Matrices**: A member inquired about methods for analyzing and proving the similarity of two language models trained with the same tokenizer but different dimensionality **embedding matrices**.
   - Suggestions included **relative representations**, **least squares mapping**, and comparing the leading entries of the eigenvalue decomposition of W^T W.
- **Relative Representations Proposed as Solution, But Maybe Not**: A member suggested **relative representations** ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15430)) as a potential solution for comparing language model embeddings, while also cautioning about their limited applicability.
   - They linked a paper discussing **cosine similarity inflation in neural representations** ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02053)) and further pointed out related works discussing whether **cosine** is the best way to assess similarity.
- **AI Representation Convergence, Plato Style**: A member linked a paper arguing that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging towards a **shared statistical model of reality**, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07987)).
   - Others suggested using **CCA** or **SVCCA** to compare the embedding matrices, referencing papers on **Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis** ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05806)) and **projection weighted CCA** ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05759)).

> `Debugger updates, SmolLM Evaluation Issues, Open LLM Leaderboard Normalization, Subtask Aggregation PR` 


- **Debugger Status remains vague**: Members requested updates on the debugger's progress, but the specific status remained unclear, with a member offering assistance by asking what branch the debugger was working on.
   - A member shared code modifications, suspecting they might be causing unnecessary load, and later reported fixing a bug related to the number of choices in questions, suggesting a PR submission.
- **SmolLM leaderboard evals return empty aggregate scores**: A member reported that aggregate scores for tasks like **leaderboard_bbh**, **leaderboard_math_hard**, and **leaderboard_musr** were empty in the results JSON when running leaderboard evaluations with **lm-eval** on **SmolLM-1.7B**.
   - They provided the command used and example output, noting that individual tasks reported numbers as usual, and linked to the [Hugging Face Dataset Card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-llm-leaderboard/HuggingFaceTB__SmolLM2-1.7B-details).
- **Non-standard Normalization on the Open LLM Leaderboard**: The discussion highlighted the use of a *non-standard normalization* method on the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://open-llm-leaderboard-blog.static.hf.space/dist/index.html#reporting_a_fairer_average_for_ranking:_using_normalized_scores) for evaluating and comparing LLMs.
   - The normalization was introduced to address issues with optimized prompts and evaluation setups that inflate model scores.
- **Subtask Aggregation PR Adds Subtask Scores**: A member shared a [PR](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/pull/2867) adding subtask aggregation, copied from a Hugging Face fork, to address missing aggregate scores in tasks with subtasks.
   - Another member tested the PR, reporting that installing **lm_eval** via editable triggered an unrelated error, but the PR otherwise appeared to work as expected.

- **Bypassing DeepSpeed Launcher on NVIDIA DGX Cloud**: A member is pre-training **GPT-NeoX** on **NVIDIA DGX Cloud** but must bypass the default `deepy.py` launcher due to SLURM and SSH restrictions, using a custom script that leverages a hostfile and `torchrun`.
   - The member is using [this script](https://github.com/ameyagodbole/hubble-gpt-neox/blob/3dd12f3cdf78a29116d55d795f783f903cc284c0/deepy_simple.py) to perform argument parsing and launch `train.py`, and has questions regarding their approach.
- **Debating Direct `train.py` Execution**: A member asked if they could directly start `python train.py` with encoded `ds_config` and `megatron_config` arguments, and how to handle GPU process spawning without `torchrun`.
   - Another member confirmed this approach for manual bypassing, suggesting further modular refactoring to inject node-local processes that self-assign rank and detect GPU count, coordinating through principle rather than protocol.
- **Navigating DGX Cloud with Torchrun**: A user is using **torchrun** due to cluster restrictions and disabled SSH, referencing a comment and sample script from the [NVIDIA DGX Cloud documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx-cloud/slurm/latest/cluster-user-guide.html#example-pytorch-job).
   - They are seeking guidance on whether they are implementing their custom solution correctly and whether they have reinvented the wheel.

> `CUDA occupancy, GPU parallel processing, A100 thread limit, GRPO training with Qwen` 


- ****Debate sparks over maximum parallel threads on A100 GPUs****: A discussion arose regarding the calculation of the maximum number of threads that can run in parallel on an A100 GPU, with one member stating the number is **96 * 2048**.
   - Another member uses GeoHot's tool to test this hypothesis, showing that the practical limit on their A100 (96SM) GPU is **24576**, or **256 threads per SM** before performance degrades.
- ****Warp scheduling explained as a way to hide latencies****: The discussion clarified that while a GPU can have many concurrent threads, they may not all run truly in parallel due to resource limitations like register space and shared memory.
   - A member pointed out that GPUs use **oversubscription to hide latencies**, and context switches between warps are cheap (~1 cycle), unlike CPUs, adding threads above the limit for "parallel threads" does not necessarily increase runtime, or at least not significantly/measurably.
- ****Experiments in GRPO training with Qwen 0.5B Model****: A member shared that they have finished a GRPO training run with **Qwen 0.5B** (code instruct) on the GPUMODE kernel dataset, but the model didn't effectively generate Triton kernels.
   - They hypothesize that SFT to teach the model the basics of Triton implementation, followed by GRPO for refinement, will be more successful.

> `Disable autotune, Triton kernel` 


- **Disable Triton Autotune Temporarily**: A member asked for a way to disable autotune temporarily because their **Triton kernel** is called in two situations, where only one needs autotuning, and they are using the `triton.autotune` decorator.
   - Another member suggested using a **global variable** to turn autotune on/off and reload the module, or using autotune inside the kernel instead of as a decorator.
- **Global variable trick**: One member suggests turning autotune on/off using a **global variable** and reloading the module that contains the Triton kernel.
   - The other option is to use autotune inside the kernel, not as a decorator, which doesn't require reloading the module.

> `Cursor's Funding Round, Etched's New Transformer ASIC, OpenAI's New Open-Weight Language Model, OpenDeepSearch (ODS), Sophont: Open Multimodal Foundation Models for Healthcare` 


- **Cursor Closes Cashy Round, Codes Vibes**: Cursor closed a **$625M** funding round at a **$9.6B** post-money valuation, led by Thrive and A16z, with Accel as a new backer, achieving **$200M ARR**, a 4x increase from its previous round in November 2024 ([Source](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/move-openai-startup-behind-cursor-became-hottest-vibiest-thing-ai?rc=sslhyj)).
   - Abe Brown noted that Cursor's valuation has grown rapidly, sparking the buzzphrase *vibe coding* and seeing its valuation possibly reach **$10B**.
- **Etched, the Transformer ASIC Startup Etches $85M Round**: Etched, a startup developing transformer ASICs, closed an unannounced **$85M** round at a **$1.5B** valuation, following two stealth rounds at **$500M** and **$750M**, with their chip **Sohu** able to process over **500,000** tokens per second running Llama 70B ([Source](https://fxtwitter.com/ArfurRock/status/1906756943349260682)).
   - Etched claims one **8xSohu** server replaces **160 H100s**, but Sohu cannot run CNNs, LSTMs, SSMs, or any other AI models.
- **OpenAI Opens Up: Open-Weight Model Incoming**: OpenAI plans to release its first open-weight language model since GPT-2 in the coming months, seeking developer feedback on how to make it maximally useful ([Source](https://openai.com/open-model-feedback/)).
   - The company will evaluate the model according to their preparedness framework and host developer events in SF, Europe, and APAC to gather feedback and test early prototypes, and Nathan Lambert expects a **30B** parameter reasoning model with MIT/Apache license  ([Source](https://x.com/natolambert/status/1907072904321490953)).
- **OpenDeepSearch Opens Up Web Search**: Seoong79 announced the release of **OpenDeepSearch (ODS)**, an open-source search agent that works with any LLM, outperforming OpenAI’s specialized model for web search, GPT-4o-Search, on the challenging, multi-hop FRAMES benchmark from DeepMind by +9.7% accuracy ([Source](https://x.com/sewoong79/status/1906595129965912341)).
- **Sophont Startup Seeks to Solve Medical AI**: iScienceLuvr announced the launch of **Sophont**, a company building open multimodal foundation models for the future of healthcare, aiming to create a *DeepSeek* for medical AI ([Source](https://x.com/iscienceluvr/status/1906790937604579430)).

> `DeepSeek R1, xAI Acquires X, Hyperparameter tuning LLMs, SFTTrainer hanging, stable_baselines3 CPU faster than GPU` 


- **DeepSeek R1 outmaneuvers Western labs**: A user linked to a [tweet](https://x.com/rosstaylor90/status/1906982769361666383) criticizing lazy attacks trying to downplay **DeepSeek R1**, which outmaneuvered bloated Western labs through ferocious execution and resource efficiency.
   - The member added that **DeepSeek** also released weights under a maximally permissive **MIT license** and democratized **RL** for the **GPU poor** through **GRPO**.
- **xAI gobbles up X**: A member linked to a [tweet](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1905731750275510312) announcing that **xAI** has acquired **X** in an all-stock transaction, valuing **xAI** at **$80 billion** and **X** at **$33 billion**.
   - The combination unlocks immense potential by blending **xAI’s** advanced **AI** capability and expertise with **X’s** massive reach.
- **LLM Hyperparameter Tuning Resource Quest**: A member inquired about resources for choosing hyperparameters when fine-tuning **LLMs**, seeking a *god send of a resource* that addresses how changing context affects certain hyperparameters.
   - Another member suggested checking out **Unsloth's Discord** and linked to [Unsloth's LoRA Hyperparameters Guide](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/beginner-start-here/lora-hyperparameters-guide).
- **SFTTrainer freezes mid-training**: A user reported that their **SFTTrainer** was hanging after truncating the training dataset, and it timed out after an hour.
   - A member suggested that the issue might be due to a lack of progress bar appearance and potential misconfiguration of **TrainingArguments** or **Trainer** settings.
- **CPU outruns GPU with stable_baselines3**: A user reported receiving a warning about running **PPO** on the **GPU** with **MlpPolicy**, suggesting it's primarily intended for the **CPU**, and linked to a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/issues/1245).
   - The user was confused why the **CPU** might be faster than the **GPU** when running a **Multi-Layer Perceptron**.

- **tinygrad BEAM Blazes Past tf-metal**: One user reported achieving **3.2 it/s** on an M1 Pro without BEAM, **28.36 it/s** with **BEAM=2**, and about **25 it/s** using Keras with tf-metal.
   - George Hotz responded, *"glad to see it's faster than tf-metal with BEAM!"*
- **Mobile GPUs Get Texture Boost With ImageDType**: The discussion indicates **ImageDType** and related functions might optimize for mobile GPUs' texture performance, citing a potential [Microsoft research paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mobigpu_mobicom22_camera.pdf) on mobile GPUs.
   - One member questioned the necessity of hardcoding layout specifics and suggested **HWC (Height, Width, Channel)** handling should be part of normal **conv2d** with user-defined padding.
- **arange() Gets Optimized**: A member discovered suboptimal code generation for small **arange** ranges (e.g., `arange(1, 2, 0.1)`) compared to larger ranges (e.g., `arange(1, 10, 0.1)`), then added a chapter on `.arange()` [here](https://xl0.github.io/tinygrad-notes/arange.html).
   - They also spotted an unnecessary addition in the generated code, suggesting a fix from `((float)((ridx0+1)))*0.1f)+0.9f)` to `(((float)((ridx0)))*0.1f)+1.0f)`.
