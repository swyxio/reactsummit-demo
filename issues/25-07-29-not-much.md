- [**Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 · Hugging Face**](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507) ([Score: 493, Comments: 224](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mcfmd2/qwenqwen330ba3binstruct2507_hugging_face/)): **The post discusses the release and performance metrics of the Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 large language model on HuggingFace, highlighting a benchmark comparison image indicating substantial performance increases, but also noting *'hybrid reasoning seriously hurts the intelligence of a model.'* ([Hugging Face model card](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507)). It requests GGUF format quantization and mentions notable quantization contributors like Unsloth, Bartwoski, and Mradermacher, indicating community interest in efficient inference and deployment options.** Commenters debate the trade-offs of hybrid reasoning architectures, with one stating it 'seriously hurts the intelligence' (likely referencing the observed benchmark regression in hybrid configurations). There is evident demand for fast quantization conversions (GGUF) for practical deployment, reflecting priorities in model usability beyond raw accuracy.
    - A commenter observes that hybrid reasoning appears to significantly degrade model intelligence, referencing a benchmark comparison image that shows major performance drops when hybrid techniques are applied, suggesting potential tradeoffs or limitations of such architectures.
    - danielhanchen provides technical details on the availability of GGUF-format models for Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507, referencing https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-GGUF for downloads and https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/qwen3-2507 for documentation on both running GGUFs and the 235B MoE model. It is also specified that the Instruct variant was evaluated using `temperature = 0.7` and `top_p = 0.8` generation parameters.
    - There is an implicit technical request in the thread regarding GGUF (quantized) versions of the model, addressed by mentioning the work by Unsloth and others in converting large models like Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 to efficient, quantized formats for broader deployment and reduced inference cost.
- [**Newest Qwen made me cry. It's not perfect, but I still love it.**](https://i.redd.it/gnkbnxzlouff1.png) ([Score: 322, Comments: 60](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mci7uu/newest_qwen_made_me_cry_its_not_perfect_but_i/)): **The image reportedly shows the latest Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 model refusing to fabricate information and instead explicitly admitting it cannot find an answer. This behavior is notable compared to earlier LLMs, which often hallucinated or generated plausible-sounding but incorrect responses when they lacked knowledge. The post highlights increased reliability and cautiousness in this Qwen iteration, reflecting improvements in refusal and uncertainty handling compared to prior versions.** A top comment praises this behavior as "perfection," stating it's preferable to honest uncertainty than confident inaccuracy; another notes the model now appears more mature and less likely to pretend expertise, which is seen as a positive technical development.
    - Several comments note that the latest Qwen models (e.g., 30B and 235B) now sometimes admit when they cannot answer a question or fail to find an issue, rather than hallucinating or fabricating information, which marks an improvement in reliability compared to earlier models.
    - A user details iterative testing with Qwen 30B, where the model initially overthinks, self-doubts, and struggles with issue identification in code debugging. Only through direct prompting and persistent clarification did the model finally address all issues, but it still failed to recommend a general-purpose prompt improvement until the user switched to the 235B version, which provided a usable prompt template.
    - Re-using the improved prompt generated by the larger Qwen-235B model led to successful code correction by the 30B model in a single pass, demonstrating the impact of prompt engineering and the value in transferring prompt templates between model sizes for enhanced performance.
- [**🚀 Qwen3-30B-A3B Small Update**](https://i.redd.it/nd904g7gbuff1.jpeg) ([Score: 214, Comments: 34](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mcg4qt/qwen330ba3b_small_update/)): **The image is a technical benchmark comparison highlighting improvements in the Qwen3-30B-A3B model after a recent update. Benchmark results—such as GPQA: 70.4 vs 54.8 (+15.6), AIME25: 61.3 vs 21.6 (+39.7), and several others—demonstrate significant gains over previous versions, particularly in reasoning (GPQA, Arena-Hard v2), math (AIME25), and code (LiveCodeBench v6). Another key enhancement shown is the increase in supported context length from** `128k` **to** `256k` **tokens, positioning the model close to GPT-4o and Qwen3-235B-A22B (Non-Thinking) in performance, while operating exclusively in non-thinking mode (no <think> blocks).** Commenters share practical deployment tips, such as GGUF format links and preferred inference settings (`temperature = 0.7, top_p = 0.8`). The substantial numerical improvements in benchmarks are also noted as a major leap rather than a 'small update', sparking appreciation for the update's impact.
    - A user shared that they have produced GGUF quantized versions of Qwen3-30B-A3B models available at https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-GGUF and recommended generation settings of `temperature = 0.7, top_p = 0.8` for optimal model performance.
    - Performance benchmarks indicated substantial improvements of Qwen3-30B-A3B over previous versions: on GPQA accuracy increased from 54.8 to 70.4 (+15.6), AIME25 from 21.6 to 61.3 (+39.7), LiveCodeBench v6 from 29.0 to 43.2 (+14.2), Arena-Hard v2 from 24.8 to 69.0 (+44.2), and BFCL-v3 from 58.6 to 65.1 (+6.5). Context window has also doubled from 128k to 256k tokens.

The educator warns that free users, lacking access to these top-tier models, risk being misinformed, and therefore recommends alternatives like Gemini 2.5 Pro for free access to more accurate guidance in educational tasks, especially for subjects vulnerable to hallucination errors.
    - Several commenters noted that the current "study mode" implementation mainly repackages prompt strategies rather than adding fundamentally new learning capabilities, and that future iterations with better fine-tuned, dedicated models for learning could improve the educational experience. This underlines current technical limitations—primarily system prompt constraints—while hinting at a roadmap toward more sophisticated model specialization for education.
- [**Study mode for students finally available!!**](https://i.redd.it/8h6kr7caiuff1.jpeg) ([Score: 1008, Comments: 73](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1mch6jr/study_mode_for_students_finally_available/)): **The image appears to be an announcement or preview showing that a 'study mode' is now available for students—likely in a popular AI product such as ChatGPT. The feature seems oriented toward educational use-cases, enabling use of AI for research, learning, and study assistance, addressing previous concerns about AI's impact on academic integrity. Commenters also suggest the new mode could be enhanced by features showing students' work and learning process, not just answers.** Several users highlight this as a necessary development given the growing integration of AI into education, and suggest the addition of a 'show your work' feature to promote understanding and ethical use. There is optimism about the potential long-term success and educational value if implemented thoughtfully.
    - A commenter proposes implementing a "show your work" mode in ChatGPT for educational use. This feature would log the student's step-by-step process, questions asked, and responses received, allowing evaluators to verify genuine learning rather than simply checking answers. The emphasis is on increasing transparency and encouraging actual comprehension rather than shortcutting the learning process via AI-generated answers.
    - Discussion points include the possible impact of AI-powered tutors like ChatGPT on educational systems and long-term outcomes, such as self-learners influencing college admissions trends. Comparisons are drawn to platforms like Khan Academy, highlighting ChatGPT's potential to serve as a personalized, scalable tutoring solution that may reshape traditional educational pathways.
    - There is consensus that integrating structured AI study tools (e.g., dedicated study modes) can guide students to use AI for enrichment rather than dependency, and that this early step by OpenAI indicates intent for AI as a supportive, rather than replacement, element in education.

### 3. AI Impact on Jobs and Society: Industry Predictions and Ethical Concerns

- [**Anthropic CEO: AI Will Write 90% Of All Code 3-6 Months From Now**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1mch6sg/anthropic_ceo_ai_will_write_90_of_all_code_36/) ([Score: 505, Comments: 212](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1mch6sg/anthropic_ceo_ai_will_write_90_of_all_code_36/)): **Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, predicted that AI would be responsible for writing 90% of code within 3-6 months of his statement (originally reported by Business Insider). As of now, with a month remaining, current AI tools (such as Copilot, ChatGPT Code Interpreter, and Claude) do not fully autonomously generate the majority of production code, with API and context window limits being significant constraints. There is little quantitative evidence supporting a 50% or higher share of code written directly by AI in industry settings.** Commenters highlight that Amodei's prediction may depend on the definition of code generation (i.e., validating if "aid" versus "autonomous writing" counts), with some arguing that while AI heavily assists coders, fully autonomous generation is still uncommon. API rate limits and issues with quality/functionality remain blockers; however, the rate of advancement is acknowledged as surprising even to skeptics from just a year ago.
    - There is skepticism about AI autonomously writing 90% of all code in the near future due to technical constraints such as API rate limits and the underlying architecture of most large language models (LLMs). The quadratic scaling of self-attention mechanisms in transformer-based LLMs is cited as a fundamental bottleneck, requiring significant breakthroughs for independent high-volume code generation.
    - Some practitioners note that if the claim refers simply to the proportion of code generated by AI (even as suggestions or tab-completes), the percentages are already high—one professional engineer notes that token-level contributions from AI can be upwards of 50% of new code in their workflow. However, this reflects AI as an assistive tool, not as an autonomous coder.
    - The discussion makes clear that 'writing' code is nuanced: current implementations mostly involve AI acting as an advanced autocomplete or ideation partner rather than reliably producing entire functional systems without human oversight or detailed prompting. True autonomy at the 90% level would likely require advances well beyond existing LLM architectures.
- [**zuckerberg offered a dozen people in mira murati's startup up to a billion dollars, not a single person has taken the offer**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1mcirpx/zuckerberg_offered_a_dozen_people_in_mira_muratis/) ([Score: 785, Comments: 182](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1mcirpx/zuckerberg_offered_a_dozen_people_in_mira_muratis/)): **Mark Zuckerberg reportedly offered individual compensation packages of up to $1B to at least a dozen employees of Mira Murati's (CTO of OpenAI) startup in an aggressive recruiting effort, referencing a screenshot of internal discussions. None of the targeted engineers or researchers accepted the offer, indicating extremely high retention or commitment to mission within that startup.** Commentary centers on whether this is due to strong belief in the startup's vision and/or culture, or active aversion to working for Meta. The offer amount ($1B) is described as extreme, highlighting intense competition for top-tier AGI talent and possibly underscoring skepticism toward Meta's AI reputation.
    - A major technical insight is that the AI researchers reportedly declined offers from Meta worth up to $1B, possibly due to significant equity stakes in Mira Murati's startup that could already be worth "a couple hundred million each". This implies strong confidence in the valuation and growth potential of the startup, as well as the high market value of leading AI talent.
    - Speculation exists that publicizing these outsized offers could be a strategic move to support the startup's next fundraising round, by reinforcing perceived demand and team commitment. This reflects a broader trend in AI startups leveraging PR and funding narratives to enhance valuations and attract investment.
- [**A new deal with Microsoft that would let them keep using OpenAI's tech even after AGI is reached.**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-29/microsoft-s-access-to-openai-tech-is-focus-of-contract-talks) ([Score: 165, Comments: 24](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1mcej0x/a_new_deal_with_microsoft_that_would_let_them/)): **Microsoft's new proposed deal with OpenAI (referenced via [archive](https://archive.ph/wd8eX)) would grant continued access to OpenAI's latest models and technology even *post-AGI*, contingent on a** `30-35% equity stake`**, an increased non-profit stake, reduced OpenAI revenue share for Microsoft, operational freedoms, and enforceable safety provisions. This framework reflects an escalation in Microsoft's strategic alignment and risk-sharing with OpenAI over future AGI development and commercialization.** Commenters highlight Microsoft's deep dependency on OpenAI and note perceived differences in performance between Copilot (built on GPT-4) and ChatGPT-4, speculating whether upcoming upgrades (e.g., GPT-5) will bridge capability gaps.
    - Discussion clarifies that under OpenAI's current contract, a threshold event like achieving AGI would limit Microsoft's rights to use OpenAI models. The noted Bloomberg report highlights negotiations to allow Microsoft longer-term or ongoing access even post-AGI, which impacts both technical deployment rights and business continuity for Microsoft if AGI is achieved.
    - A technical comparison is raised regarding Copilot (business) and ChatGPT-4, noting that although both leverage GPT-4, Copilot's performance does not match standalone ChatGPT-4. The comment anticipates that Copilot could see improvements with GPT-5, suggesting technical differences in implementation or tuning between Microsoft's product integration and OpenAI's primary offerings.
    - A misconception is noted: while someone asks if GPT is open source, in fact, GPT-3/4 and later models are not open source; only older models like GPT-2 are. This distinction is central to understanding why Microsoft needs contractual rights and cannot simply self-host the latest models without OpenAI's continued partnership.

- **Debate if LLMs watch visions at 1fps**: Members discussed whether current LLMs process video like images at **1fps** or if they have true video encoders that can create a continuous vector of all frames.
   - One member questioned how the vector would look for videos with different numbers of frames, suggesting options like same size or directly proportional to the number of frames.
- **Architectures for encoding video into a single vector discussed**: A member proposed creating an architecture to encode any video into a single vector equivalent to **2048 tokens** as text tokens, but it might imply loss of detail for longer videos.
   - They suggested using vectors for each second or frame and creating proper relation between audio and image in a video.
- **Vision Embedding techniques examined**: Members explored whether having an encoder that understands sequential dependencies in data would make models smarter than just using images, and how to encode multiple modalities in parallel.
   - One member stated that the understanding happens inside the model, not when embedding, and that **SigLip** creates the embedding vector with some understanding of the image.
- **Gemma 3 vision quantization**: One member questioned the quantization version for **Gemma 3**'s vision part, noting that the convolution weight/filter *v.patch_embd.weight* remains in float32.

- **OpenRouter's PR Nudged for Normie Newbies**: Some members suggested that OpenRouter's PR might suffer because new users may not know they can change providers, citing complaints about **DeepSeek** models in chutes.
   - It's like going to a restaurant and ordering the first thing you see rather than asking the waiter what to order or what the restaurant is known for.*
- **Model Pricing Doesn't Reflect Quantization Quality**: A member noted that OpenRouter's reputation already suffers by favoring the cheapest models, often blaming **DeepInfra** quants for poor performance.
   - Many users don't know what quant is, or even that OR doesn't host the models themselves, and assume best-case quality when they see a price for a model.
- **Determinism is Difficult and Expensive**: External pressure exists that leads to a race to the bottom, both for the providers (find cheaper inference) and for OR (find cheaper providers).
   - Requiring 100% determinism is difficult - why bother spending effort and compute on 100% determinism if there's no demand for it? Especially since big-name providers like **OpenAI** and **Anthropic** don't have deterministic outputs.
- **Standard Lane Routing Balances Quality Factors**: OpenRouter is actively working on what they call their **standard lane routing** which right now sorts purely by price, but they wanna consider other factors like throughput, latency, objective data on things like tool call success rates, possibly quantization, essentially reaching more towards which provider offers the best version of a model.
   - They are kind of trying to define what best means here through a variety of factors rather than just *here’s the cheapest version*.
- **Quality Preset Requested for End Users**: One member requested a **best quality option/preset** for end users that doesn't want to think too much about these issues and has not the time to check each provider regularly.
   - No one from the OpenRouter team responded to this request.

   - He is encouraging community members to apply.
- ****ICL Breaking Interpretability Tools****: A member suggested that **in-context learning (ICL)** could potentially *break interpretability tools* by pushing activations out of distribution.
   - This concern was framed as an instance of the **Lucas Critique** ([Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique)), increasing confidence in the hypothesis.
- ****SAEs Struggle with OOD Activations****: A participant posited that **ICL** could push activations out of distribution, potentially breaking activation-based interpretability tools like **SAEs** due to increased false negatives and positives.
   - Another argued that applying **SAEs** to contexts with significant **ICL** would likely fail, not specifically due to **ICL** itself, but because **sparse representations often do not generalize to distributions of activations they were not trained on**.
- ****Lucas Critique Connects to LLM Safety****: One participant explained the **Lucas Critique** as the need for predictions based on microfoundations invariant to interventions, like using words to elicit intelligent behavior from an **LLM**.

> `Sparsity in CPUs/GPUs, MoE Performance, Kimi K2 vs Claude, Optimal Active Parameter Count` 


- **Sparsity increases with model size**: As model size increases, the optimal sparsity for a fixed budget also increases, especially when paying for a training run.
   - While sparsity can harm performance for GPU-centric end-users with extensive training budgets, it is ideal for finding the **lowest dollar count** to achieve the most performance, with faster training times and increased total parameter count.
- **Modern Dropless MoEs Outperform**: Modern dropless **Mixture of Experts (MoEs)** outperform the geomean rule (`effective parameter count ~= sqrt(active * total parameters)`) due to various tricks and optimizations.
   - MoEs tend to train **2.2 to 2.5x** the speed of dense networks of the same parameter count, with recent ones performing at **3.2x** the speed and Baidu publishing **~50% MGH** for **ERNIE-MoE** training, indicating headroom for further improvements.
- **Kimi K2 Challenges Claude**: **Kimi K2**, despite being sparser, is competitive with **Claude**, which is considered a large dense model.
   - The competitive edge of Kimi K2 is likely due to extensive **RL (Reinforcement Learning)** rather than the architecture, as previous open-source models had gaps in agentic stuff compared to Claude.
- **Optimal Active Parameter Count Scales with Total Parameters**: The optimal active parameter count increases with total parameter size, but the active parameter count scales linearly or slightly sub-linearly, while the total parameter count increases linearly at a higher rate or hyper-linearly.
   - For instance, **100B total parameters with 1B active parameters** is possible, but the limiting factor is the cost of the training run; a member links to a thread from @LTSI_TheCaptain: [Is 32K context length enough](https://x.com/LTSI_TheCaptain/status/1950272036074582040).

> `external_call usage in Mojo, C ABI function calls, Mojo standard library development, File descriptor features, Mojo module naming feature request` 


- ****external_call** Just Calls C Functions**: The `external_call` function in Mojo can call any **C ABI function**, as long as the symbol is linked into the current address space.
   - The Mojo team prefers to keep the amount of extra C code to a minimum, requiring justification for its use when Mojo code isn't feasible.
- **Mojo Has File Descriptor Features**: Mojo already includes file descriptor features via `io.file_descriptor.FileDescriptor`, and the team aims to minimize the use of `external_call` within these features.
   - Using `read` and `write` at the operating system level allows for better portability, aligning with Mojo's goals.
- **Mojo stdlib development does not require touching the compiler**: It was noted that most functionalities can be implemented in the **Mojo standard library** without modifying the compiler itself.
   - This approach leverages the flexibility of Mojo and its FFI capabilities, where only the ability to *call this symbol that has a C ABI* is needed from the compiler.
- **Mojo Consistent Module Naming Request**: A [feature request](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/5094) has been created to establish consistent naming conventions for Mojo modules.
   - The goal is to decouple naming from the Python API, aiming to reduce confusion and avoid the constraints of Python's 30-year-old naming system.

- **Max to Drop PyTorch 2.7 Dependency Soon™️**: The **PyTorch 2.7 dependency** is slated to be removed in the next nightly build, granting users the freedom to employ independent PyTorch versions.
   - This transition is credited to the *amazing work* of a user and others on the team.
- **Max's Lower Bound for PyTorch: 2.0**: Although the minimum pinned version is **2.5**, the team believes that **2.0** is the realistic lower bound for PyTorch compatibility with Max.
   - Users are advised to consider this when managing their PyTorch environments.
