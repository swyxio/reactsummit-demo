We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **32** Discords (**215** channels, and **6058** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **607 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

With the [departure of key researchers](https://x.com/steph_palazzolo/status/1869848094009110826), [Veo 2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42432914) beating Sora Turbo in heads up comparisons, and Noam Shazeer debuting a [new Gemini 2.0 Flash Reasoning](https://x.com/noamshazeer/status/1869789881637200228?s=46) model, the mood around OpenAI has been tense to say the least.

But patience has been rewarded.

As [teased by sama](https://x.com/sama/status/1869963879671013774) and with clues uncovered by [internet sleuths](https://x.com/btibor91/status/1870022347349987532) and [journalists](https://x.com/steph_palazzolo/status/1869919189240254781?s=46), the last day of OpenAI's Shipmas brought the biggest announcement: **o3 and o3-mini** were announced, with breathtaking early benchmark results:

- **FrontierMath**: the hardest Math benchmark ever ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-frontiermath-a-benchmark-for-evaluating/)) went from 2% -> 25% SOTA 
  - ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/aa59bda9-8693-4322-ad64-e8e34684f147.png?w=960&fit=max)
- **ARC-AGI**: the famously difficult general reasoning benchmark extended in a ~straight line the performance seen by the o1 models, in both o3 low ($20/task) and o3 high ($thousands/task) settings. [Greg Kamradt](https://x.com/GregKamradt/status/1870208490096218244) appeared on the announcement [to verify this](https://x.com/arcprize/status/1870169260850573333) and [published a blogpost](https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough) with their thoughts on the results. As they state, "ARC-AGI-1 took 4 years to go from 0% with GPT-3 in 2020 to 5% in 2024 with GPT-4o". o1 then extended it to 32% in its highest setting, and o3-high pushed to 87.5% (about 11 years worth of progress on the GPT3->4o scaling curve) 
  - ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6c076cb4-4737-405a-aa92-e775880ba13d.png?w=960&fit=max)
- **SWEBench-Verified, Codeforces, AIME, GPQA**: It's too easy to forget that none of these models existed before September, and o1 was only made available in API this Tuesday: ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/117dd51f-8679-4540-92c0-41f85cd7b2e4.png?w=960&fit=max)

**o1-mini** is not to be overlooked, as [the distillation team proudly showed off](https://x.com/shengjia_zhao/status/1870176031610667223) how  it has an overwhelmingly superior inference-intelligence curve than o3-full: ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ff63840a-8b1a-4402-beb8-55d563d3e84e.png?w=960&fit=max)

as [sama says](https://x.com/sama/status/1870266813248053426): "on many coding tasks, o3-mini will outperform o1 at a massive cost reduction! i expect this trend to continue, but also that **the ability to get marginally more performance for exponentially more money will be really strange**."

[Eric Wallace](https://x.com/Eric_Wallace_/status/1870176920706658692) also published a post on their [o-series deliberative alignment strategy](https://openai.com/index/deliberative-alignment/) and [applications are open](https://openai.com/index/early-access-for-safety-testing/) for safety researchers to test it out.
