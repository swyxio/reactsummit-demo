<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 4/2/2024-4/3/2024. We checked 5 subreddits and [**364** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **26** Discords (**382** channels, and **4673** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **512 minutes**.

Apple is finally waking up to AI in a big way [ahead of WWDC](https://analyticsindiamag.com/what-to-expect-at-the-absolutely-incredible-apple-wwdc-2024/). [We featured MM1 a couple weeks ago](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-mm1-apples-first-large-multimodal-model/) and now a different team is presenting [ReALM: Reference Resolution As Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20329). Reference resolution in their terminology refers to understanding what ambiguous references like "they" or "that" or "the bottom one" or "this number present onscreen" refer to, based on 3 contexts - 1) what's on screen, 2) entities relevant to the conversation, and 3) background entities. They enable all sorts of assistant-like usecases:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/d38ff8cd-58f1-4e6c-8ff0-227006ec7cfd.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Which is a challenging task given it basically has to read your mind.

The authors use a mix of labeled and synthetic data to finetune a much smaller FLAN-T5 model  that beats GPT4 at this task:
 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1e53fed9-dd25-43bd-83ce-ef33cfb2875c.png?w=960&fit=max) 

No model release, no demo. But it's nice to see how they are approaching this problem, and the datasets and models are small enough to be replicable for anyone determined enough.

The [AI content creator industrial complex has gone bonkers over it](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2403.20329), of course. There only a few more months' worth of headlines to make about things beating GPT4 before this is itself beaten to death.

# AI Twitter Recap

> all recaps done by Claude 3 Opus, best of 4 runs. We are working on clustering and flow engineering with Haiku.

**Anthropic Research on Jailbreaking LLMs**

- **Many-shot jailbreaking technique**: [@AnthropicAI](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1775211248239464837) released a research paper studying a long-context jailbreaking technique effective on most large language models. The research shows increasing context window is a double-edged sword, making models more useful but also vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
- **Principled and predictable technique**: [@EthanJPerez](https://twitter.com/EthanJPerez/status/1775230994087543155) noted this is the most effective, reliable, and hard to train away jailbreak known, based on in-context learning. It predictably gets worse with model scale and context length.
- **Concerning results**: [@sleepinyourhat](https://twitter.com/sleepinyourhat/status/1775212287214981207) found the results interesting and concerning, showing many-shot prompting for harmful behavior gets predictably more effective at overcoming safety training with more examples, following a power law.

**Adversarial Validation Technique for Identifying Distribution Shifts**

- **Clever trick to check train/test distribution**: [@svpino](https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1775154270708396215) shared a trick called Adversarial Validation to determine if train and test data come from the same distribution. Put them together, remove target, add binary feature for train/test, train simple model. If AUC near 0.5, same distribution. If near 1, different distributions.
- **Useful for identifying problem features**: Adversarial Validation can identify problem features causing distribution shift. Compute feature importance, remove most important, rebuild model, recompute AUC. Repeat until AUC near 0.5. Useful in production to identify distribution shifts.

**Impact of Taiwan Earthquake on Semiconductor Supply**

- **Proximity of earthquake to fabs**: [@nearcyan](https://twitter.com/nearcyan/status/1775382258767016116) noted the 7.4 earthquake was 64 miles from Central Taiwan Science Park. In 1999, a 7.7 quake near fabs caused production losses. 2016 6.6 quake only delayed ~1% TSMC orders.
- **TSMC preparedness**: TSMC is well prepared for larger quakes. Government prioritizes utility restoration for fabs. No structural damage reported yet. Expect more disruption at Hsinchu/Taichung than 3nm Tainan fab.
- **Potential delays**: Expect nontrivial delays of at least few weeks, possibly months if unlucky. Will likely cause short-term semiconductor price action.

**AI Advancements and Developments**

- **Effective Batch Size Optimization**: Seanb2792 mentioned that while computationally the cost might be similar, increasing the effective batch size can be achieved without using additional VRAM. This is particularly valuable as larger batch sizes may enhance the performance of certain models.
- **Batch Size Affects Model Performance**: In tests on medical data, Huzuni found that a **larger batch size generally results in better performance**, even if the improvements are marginal or non-significant.
- **Batch Normalization Draws Concern**: Huzuni also observed that accumulating more than two batches can have a detrimental effect on performance, likely due to batch normalization, based on their latest tests.

- **LLM Fine-tuning on a Budget**: A user is exploring how to build a language model on top of PDFs with limited computational resources, preferring to use inference with open-source models like llama2, mistral, phi, etc. There is an inquiry about the minimum requirements for llm models, mentioning that *phi-2* requires more than 10GB of free space to run on a PC with 16GB RAM.

- **KV Cache Queries in Transformers**: A member asks for use cases or examples related to using KV Cache with HuggingFace, linking to the specific [Dynamic Cache](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/c9f6e5e35156e068b227dd9b15521767f6afd4d2/src/transformers/cache_utils.py#L76) in the transformers' GitHub repository.

- **Changing Special Tokens in Tokenizers**: There's a discussion on how to modify special tokens in a tokenizer when fine-tuning an LLM. A member provided a solution to add new special tokens using `tokenizer.add_special_tokens(special_tokens)` and another advised changing the tokenizer's dictionary directly but cautioned about potential merges during tokenization.

- **Issues with Multinode Fine-tuning**: A user experiences a timeout while trying to finetune llama2 using multi-node from Docker with deepspeed and axolotl. Despite having proper communication between nodes and visible GPUs in their stack, the fine-tuning process freezes with the given deepspeed command.

- **Calls for Structured Training Examples**: A user struggles with training GPT2 for text summarization, encountering issues like OOM errors and stagnating validation metrics. They suggest that HuggingFace should provide structured examples on how to perform specific tasks with various models to aid users in their training efforts.

- **Seeking DiT with Enhanced Conditioning**: A user inquired about a modified **DiT (Diffusion Image Transformer)** that supports conditioning with text, images, or other modalities using cross-attention. The only available DiT on Hugging Face Diffusers is conditioned by class, and the original team's source code isn't publicly shared, as noted with a [link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.04557v1).
  
- **Cost Concerns of Public DiTs**: A member pointed out that publicly available **DiTs** are class-conditioned because it's more cost-effective compared to cross-attention methods, echoing the discussion about the expense of such models.

- **Exploration of Diffusion Models for Depth Mapping**: A user is considering modifying **Stable Diffusion (SD)** for converting stereo images into depth maps, as the current best public model for such a task is inadequate for their challenge.

- **Potential Modification of Stable Diffusion Architectures**: The user asked if it's possible to fine-tune Stable Diffusion using input images with more than three channels, exploring the feasibility of using **LoRA** or **ControlNet** with StableDiffusion for their task.

- **Advocacy for Modifying SD Over Training from Scratch**: In response to the query, another participant suggested slightly modifying the SD architecture to adapt it for the user's needs, indicating that training from scratch should be a last resort option.

- **The Perils of Non-Trivial Structs**: It's confirmed that **@register_passable("trivial")** can't be used for structs with memory allocation due to the shared pointer issue, requiring the use of **@register_passable** for proper functionality.

- **Embarking on SIMD Search**: A member aimed to implement SIMD Naïve Search in Mojo but was unclear about implementing 'found' and 'SIMDcompare' functions. A fellow member compared it with native Mojo code for SIMD operations, pointing to **[Mojo's SIMD documentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01506.pdf)** as a starting point.

- **Top-Level Code Temporarily Grounded**: Discussion around the introduction of top-level code in Mojo reveals complications without a current estimated time of arrival. The issue with a missing page on the "escaping" operator has been raised, and the documentation team has been pinged.

- **A Decorator's Dilemma**: Custom decorators in Mojo are not yet possible, as they're hardcoded in the compiler; a workaround was shared to manually decorate functions, while acknowledging the limitation.

- **Equality Check Enigma in Iteration**: A scenario where a member tried to check for string equality within a List iteration in Mojo led to a clarification that explicit dereferencing with brackets `x[]` is required due to how Mojo handles Reference types.

- **Clarifying Throughput Efficiency**: A user referenced a paper, highlighting that efficiency **per token** increases as it's measured by end-to-end throughput (encoding + decoding) divided by **total number of tokens**.
- **Debating the Speed of Token Generation**: A discussion ensued about how adding more tokens can lead to increased speed. The point raised was that while encoding may run in parallel, decoding is sequential, hence the expectation that each additional token would take the same amount of time to decode.
- **Encoding Speed Insight**: Further explanation clarified that the graph in question showed speed for generating a constant 512 tokens, which implies that any speedup in the plot is associated with the **encoding process**.
- **Decoding Speed Questioned**: There was persistence in understanding the process, questioning how decoding could get faster with a larger context since it's sequential in nature, requiring each token to wait for its predecessor.

- **Terminology Tangle in Conversation Logs**: A participant made an observation regarding the `responses` table in `logs.db`, revealing an interest in what to call parts of a dialogue. They shared that the initial part of a conversation where the first person speaks is termed a "speaker turn" or "turn," leading them to name their app's table `turns` instead.
