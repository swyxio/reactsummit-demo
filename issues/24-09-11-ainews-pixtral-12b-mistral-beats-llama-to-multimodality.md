Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **411 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Late last night Mistral was back to its old self - unlike Mistral Large 2 ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-mistral-large-2/)), **Pixtral** was [released as a magnet link](https://x.com/MistralAI/status/1833758285167722836) with no accompanying paper or blogpost, ahead of the Mistral AI Summit today celebrating the company's triumphant first year.

[VB of Huggingface](https://x.com/reach_vb/status/1833779749430124692) had the best breakdown:
![Mistral released Pixtral 12B Vision Language Model. Some notes on the release: 1. Text backbone: Mistral Nemo 12B 2. Vision Adapter: 400M 3. Uses GeLU (for vision adapter) & 2D RoPE (for vision encoder) 4. Larger vocabulary - 131,072 5. Three new special tokens  - `img`, `img_break`, `img_end` 6. Image size: 1024 x 1024 pixels 7. Patch size: 16 x 16 pixels 8. Tokenizer support in mistral_common 9. Model weights in bf16 10. Haven't seen the inference code yet 11. Weights up on Hugging Face Hub 🤗 GG Mistral for successfully frontrunning Meta w/ Multimodal 🐐](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/dd044b56-f77a-4891-a855-8b4715c1ecda.png?w=960&fit=max)

VB rightfully points out that Mistral beat Meta to releasing an open-weights multimodal model. You can see the new ImageChunk API in the [mistral-common update](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-common/releases/tag/v1.4.0):

> - `Mojo Copy Behavior`
> - `Ownership in Mojo`
> - `ExplicitlyCopyable Trait`
> - `Mojodojo.dev` 


- **Discussion on Mojo's Copy Behavior**: Several members expressed concerns about Mojo’s implicit copy behavior, especially when using the `owned` argument convention, which can lead to unexpected copies of large data structures.
   - Suggestions included making explicit copying the default to avoid unexpected behavior, particularly for users transitioning from languages like Python.
- **Concerns About Ownership Semantics**: Members discussed how the ownership semantics in Mojo can create 'spooky action at a distance', causing local changes to significantly alter function behaviors due to implicit copies.
   - The conversation highlighted the need for better clarity in API changes and potentially stricter rules surrounding the `ExplicitlyCopyable` trait to avoid unintentional double frees.
- **Proposal for Explicit Copy Methods**: There was a proposal to require the `ExplicitlyCopyable` trait to implement a `copy()` method, which could improve usability and clarity for developers.
   - Members suggested that a built-in `copy` function could be more Pythonic, while also debating the importance of chaining methods for functional programming styles.
- **Introduction to Mojodojo.dev**: The community discussed the open-source status of Mojodojo.dev, a resource originally created by Jack Clayton for learning Mojo.
   - Members showed interest in collaborating to enhance Mojodojo.dev, emphasizing its value as an early educational resource in the Mojo ecosystem.
- **Invitation for Contributors**: Caroline Frasca invited community members to contribute to the blog and YouTube channel, expressing the desire for more content centered around projects built with Mojo.
   - A user expressed appreciation for the game's coding resources that facilitated their understanding of Mojo.

> - `GameNGEN capabilities`
> - `GPT-4o vs GPT-3.5 benchmarks`
> - `AI capabilities in software engineering`
> - `GAIA benchmark for AI` 


- **SWE-bench performance metrics**: The SWE-bench metric observed GPT-4 solving significantly more tasks compared to GPT-3.5, especially in the <15 min category, indicating improved efficiency.
   - Though GPT-4o shows promising results, the lack of a human baseline makes it challenging to fully evaluate model performance against human engineers.
- **GameNGEN's simulation capabilities**: GameNGEN is recognized for creating a neural model that can simulate the game DOOM in real-time, suggesting possibilities for applications in world modeling.
   - Despite its impressive move towards simulating environments, it still relies on established game mechanics and assets rather than developing entirely novel 3D environments.
- **GPT-4o vs GPT-3.5 benchmarks**: GPT-4o demonstrates an 11x improvement over GPT-3.5 in solving less complex tasks within the SWE-bench benchmark.
   - However, both models struggled significantly with tasks taking more than 4 hours, indicating a potential limitation in their problem-solving capabilities.
- **AI capabilities in software engineering**: There is a growing interest in understanding how well AI can collaborate with software engineers on benchmark problems.
   - Discussions suggest that while AI models show promise, they lack the nuanced understanding and efficiency of experienced human engineers.
- **GAIA benchmark designed for AI difficulty**: The GAIA benchmark is designed to challenge AI systems while remaining manageable for human participants, with humans scoring 80-90% on tough tasks.
   - This contrasts with conventional benchmarks, which are increasingly becoming unsolvable for even skilled graduates.

> - `Chunking datasets`
> - `Performance rationale in training`
> - `EOS token usage` 


- **Is chunking datasets a standard practice?**: A user questioned whether it's standard to split datasets into **128-token chunks** for training, noting the potential impacts on model input context.
   - Responses suggest that decisions around chunking may stem from **intuitive guesses** rather than empirical studies.
- **Performance benefits vs. context loss**: Another user emphasized that it's common practice not necessarily due to studies optimizing for performance but often due to lack of solid justification.
   - The conversation implies that many might use chunking without considering its true impact on model performance.
- **Introducing EOS tokens in chunking**: A member mentioned using an **<EOS> token** as a separator before chunking data into window lengths, lacking strong justification for the method.
   - They likened the practice to how text is split in newspapers, concluding that while the position effects might average out, this still isn't definitive proof.

> - `Torchtune FP16 Support`
> - `Qwen2 Interface Discrepancies`
> - `EOS ID Handling` 


- **Torchtune does not support FP16**: A member explained that maintaining compatibility between mixed precision modules and other features requires extra work, while **bf16** half precision training is considered superior.
   - The main downside of lacking FP16 support is its incompatibility with older GPUs, which may affect some users.
- **Qwen2 Interface has differing tokenization behavior**: A member noted that the Qwen2 interface allows passing `None` for `eos_id`, resulting in a `None`-check before adding it in the `encode` method.
   - However, there may be an oversight since another case in the code does not perform this check, raising potential questions about whether this behavior is intentional or a bug.
- **Allowing None EOS ID seems problematic**: It was suggested that allowing `add_eos=True` while having `eos_id` set to `None` should not be permitted explicitly.
   - This raises concerns about the consistency and expected behavior of the tokenization process within the Qwen2 model.
