  **Over 2500 new community members joined following Soumith Chintala's
  shoutout, highlighting growing interest in SOTA LLM-based summarization. The
  major highlight is the detailed paper release of **Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3)**,
  showcasing advanced text-in-image control and complex prompt handling, with
  the model outperforming other SOTA image generation models in human-evaluated
  benchmarks. The SD3 model is based on an enhanced Diffusion Transformer
  architecture called **MMDiT**. Meanwhile, **Anthropic** released **Claude 3**
  models, noted for human-like responses and emotional depth, scoring 79.88% on
  HumanEval but costing over twice as much as GPT-4. Microsoft launched new
  Orca-based models and datasets, and Latitude released
  **DolphinCoder-StarCoder2-15b** with strong coding capabilities. Integration
  of image models by **Perplexity AI** and 3D CAD generation by **PolySpectra**
  powered by **LlamaIndex** were also highlighted. *"SD3's win rate beats all
  other SOTA image gen models (except perhaps Ideogram)"* and *"Claude 3 models
  are very good at generating d3 visualizations from text descriptions."*

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 3/4-3/5/2024. We checked [**356** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **22** Discords (**352** channels, and **7550** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **697 minutes**.

Warm welcome to the >2500 people who joined from [Soumith's shoutout](https://x.com/soumithchintala/status/1764853209498034537?s=20) last night! Its kinda like having a crowd of visitors over when the house isn't clean yet - we're still very much building the plane while we [jump off a cliff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb4ueA16IwA). But we're increasingly happy with our prompts, pipeline, and exploration of what useful, SOTA LLM-based summarization can and should do.

Lots of people are still processing Claude 3 but we're moving on. Today's big news is [the Stable Diffusion 3 paper](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39599958). SD3 was announced (not released) a few days ago, but the paper provides much more detail.

Obligatory images because really who reads the text I'm writing here when you can see pretty pictures:

We are more impressed with the incredible level of text-in-image control and handling of complex prompts (see the progress over the last 2 years):

[Paper highlights here](https://x.com/swyx/status/1765091085943218571?s=20) but in short they have modified Bill Peebles' Diffusion Transformer (yes the one used in Sora) to be even more multimodal, hence "MMDiT":

DiT variants have been the subject of intense research this year, eg for [Hourglass Diffusion](https://crowsonkb.github.io/hourglass-diffusion-transformers/) and [Emo](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1762957305401004061).

Stability's messaging around its benchmarks has been all over the place recently (e.g. for SD2 and SDXL and , making it unclear whether the main benefit is image quality or open source customizability or something else, but SD3 is pretty unambiguous - when evaluated on Partiprompts questions via REAL HUMANS ($$$), **SD3's win rate beats all other SOTA image gen models (except perhaps Ideogram).**

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f98a329d-864c-4a57-9c6a-8c049821a83c.png?w=480&fit=max) 

It's currently unclear whether the 8B SD3 model will ever be released beyond Stability's API wall. But surely a new SOTA model, from the people that launched the new imagegen summer, is to be celebrated regardless.

- **CUDA Error Mysteries**: `@artificial_anteligence` expressed frustration with a CUDA error: "CUBLAS_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED when calling `cublasCreate(handle)`." It was suggested by `@marksaroufim` that it could be a memory issue, but `@artificial_anteligence` later found [a forum post](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/runtimeerror-cuda-error-cublas-status-not-initialized-when-calling-cublascreate-handle/170409) suggesting it could also be due to incorrect tensor dimensions.
  
- **Kernel Conundrum**: `@zippika` developed a new fp4 dequant kernel using `cuda::pipeline` which surprisingly took longer to execute despite fewer sm cycles, indicating the need for testing on larger tensors.
  
- **Understanding CUTLASS Usage**: `@ericauld` sought insights on how to think about CUTLASS and its adoption, receiving a reply that CUTLASS is somewhat necessary for programming tensor cores. `@jeremyhoward` agreed that it seemed essential, while `@zippika` elaborated that tensor cores can be used without CUTLASS, citing examples like [wmma_tensorcore_sample](https://github.com/wzsh/wmma_tensorcore_sample/blob/4e79cc2f7cdd56fbef124cab551205b80c4e8399/matrix_wmma/matrix_wmma/main.cu#L50-L92) and [cuda_hgemm](https://github.com/Bruce-Lee-LY/cuda_hgemm/blob/10a8a8451f0dcd162b3790045cd7597cb48b8beb/src/wmma/wmma_async_stage3.cu#L53-L433).

- **Effective Bandwidth vs. Latency Puzzle**: `@g.huy` asked why larger unit sizes increase effective bandwidth but also result in higher latency, pointing to a [blog post](https://leimao.github.io/blog/CUDA-Vectorized-Memory-Access/) and contrasting the concept with a suggestion in [Lecture 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGhfUhlowB4) that smaller unit sizes might yield better AI performance.

- **The Difference Between "Prompt Injection" and "Jailbreaking"**: `@simonw` clarifies that **prompt injection** is an attack exploiting the concatenation of trusted and untrusted inputs in LLM applications, while **jailbreaking** involves circumventing LLM safety filters. The terms are often conflated, but distinctions matter, as explained in Simon Willison's [blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/5/prompt-injection-jailbreaking/).

- **State-Backed Actors Utilizing LLMs**: `@tariqali` discusses risks such as LLM-assisted crimes and shares a Microsoft blog on state-affiliated threat actors using OpenAI's LLMs for activities like vulnerability research and creating spear phishing emails. Notably, one actor named "Salmon Typhoon" encountered an LLM refusal when prompting to write malicious code, which was shared in the blog and linked with OpenAI's research on the subject [here](https://openai.com/blog/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai-by-state-affiliated-threat-actors).

- **LLMs and Spear Phishing**: `@tariqali` notes that LLMs are adept at creating convincing spear phishing emails which may not necessarily trigger refusal if prompts are crafted carefully.

- **Biorisk Information Accessibility Concerns**: Highlighting easy access to potentially dangerous information, `@tariqali` links to an OpenAI research initiative on an early warning system for LLM-aided biological threats, which is available [here](https://openai.com/research/building-an-early-warning-system-for-llm-aided-biological-threat-creation).

- **Managing Prompt Injection via Human Review**: `@tariqali` suggests managing prompt injection threats by controlling who accesses the LLM, while `@simonw` cautions that human review can't catch all forms of prompt injection, such as those hidden in images, and refers to his earlier [write-up](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/14/multi-modal-prompt-injection/#prompt-injection-hidden-in-images) for more context.
