As promised at [Google I/O](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-google-io-in-60-seconds/), Gemini Live launched in Android today, for Gemini Advanced subscribers, as part of the #MadeByGoogle Pixel 9 launch event. With sympathies to the [poor presenter](https://x.com/durreadan01/status/1823430521768304674) who had 2 demo failures onstage:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/7e351a3f-0f0d-4793-93ce-5b1974595c25.png?w=960&fit=max) 

The [embargoed media reviews of Gemini Live](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219736/gemini-live-hands-on-pixel-event) have been cautiously positive. It will have "[extensions](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13695044?visit_id=638591951502121215-2420806349&p=more_extensions&rd=1)" that are integrations with your Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Drive), YouTube, Google Maps, and other Google properties. 

The important thing is Google started the rollout of it today (though we still [cannot locate anyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1erdr0t/meet_gemini_live_a_new_way_to_have_more_natural/) with a live recording of it as of 5pm PT) vs a still-indeterminate date for ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode. Gemini Live will also come to iOS subscribers at a future point.

The company also shared demos of Gemini Live with [Pixel Buds Pro 2](https://x.com/greengart/status/1823444923573731411) to people in the audience and [with the WSJ](https://x.com/JoannaStern/status/1823429729870868676).

> - `PyTorch Full FP16`
> - `PyTorch Optimizer`
> - `torch.compile`
> - `Fairseq Fine-tuning` 


- **PyTorch Full FP16: Is it possible?**: A user asked if full FP16 with loss/grad scaling is possible with PyTorch core, specifically when fine-tuning a large-ish model from Fairseq.
   - They tried using `torch.GradScaler()` and casting the model to FP16 without `torch.autocast('cuda', torch.float16)`, but got an error "ValueError: Attempting to unscale FP16 gradients."
- **Custom Optimizer Implementation**: A user suggested manually accessing and scaling gradients within the optimizer's step function to achieve full FP16 functionality.
   - They provided code illustrating how to retrieve gradients from the optimizer's parameters and then apply scaling operations before calling `optimizer.step()`.
- **torch.compile: The Missing Manual**: A new PyTorch document titled "torch.compile: The Missing Manual" was shared along with a YouTube video.
   - The document and video are available at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y5CRfMLdwEoF1nTk9q8qEu1mgMUuUtvhklPKJ2emLU8/edit#heading=h.ivdr7fmrbeab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y5CRfMLdwEoF1nTk9q8qEu1mgMUuUtvhklPKJ2emLU8/edit#heading=h.ivdr7fmrbeab) and [https://www.youtube.com/live/rew5CSUaIXg?si=zwbubwKcaiVKqqpf](https://www.youtube.com/live/rew5CSUaIXg?si=zwbubwKcaiVKqqpf), respectively, and provide detailed information on utilizing `torch.compile`.
- **Fairseq's Training Approach**: The original user mentioned that Fairseq models are typically trained with their own custom full FP16 implementations.
   - They also mentioned that while fine-tuning in full BF16 is possible, FP16 AMP often performs better for smaller Fairseq models, likely because they were trained with FP16.

- **Mojo's Uncertain Open-Sourcing Future**: Users inquired about the open-sourcing timeline of Mojo's compiler.
   - While the team confirmed that the compiler will be open-sourced eventually, a public timeline is not available, suggesting that it may be a while before contributions can be made.
- **Mojo Development: Standard Library Focus**: The current focus of Mojo development is on building out the standard library.
   - Users are encouraged to contribute to the standard library, while work on the compiler is ongoing, but not yet open to contributions.
- **Mojo Learning for Students**: A college student inquired about resources for learning Mojo, including compiler basics and MLIR.
   - The team suggested starting with learning Mojo itself and contributing to the standard library, while MLIR knowledge will be helpful for future compiler contributions.
- **Mojo Compiler:  Limited Documentation and  Internal Dialects**: The team acknowledges the lack of documentation for Mojo's internal dialects, which has made development challenging for some contributors.
   - The ability to add rewrite rules directly to the compiler is being considered, but it is not currently possible, leading some to shelve their projects due to the high time investment required to reverse-engineer the compiler.

> - `Tensor Filtering`
> - `Transcendental Folding Optimization`
> - `CUDA TIMEOUT ERROR` 


- **Tensor Filtering the Fastest Way?**: A user asked for the fastest way to filter a Tensor, such as `t[t % 2 == 0]`, currently doing it by converting to list, filtering, and converting back to list.
   - A suggestion was made to use masking if computing something on a subset of the Tensor, but it was noted that the exact functionality is not possible yet.
- **Transcendental Folding Refactor Optimization**: A user proposed a refactor to only apply transcendental rewrite rules if the backend does not have a code_for_op for the uop.
   - The user implemented a `transcendental_folding` function and called it from `UOpGraph.__init__` but wasn't sure how this could be net negative lines, and asked what could be removed.
- **CUDA TIMEOUT ERROR**: A user ran a script using `CLANG=1` and received a `RuntimeError: wait_result: 10000 ms TIMEOUT!` error.
   - The error occurred with the default runtime and was resolved by using `CUDA=1`, and the issue was potentially related to ##4562.
