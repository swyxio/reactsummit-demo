> AI News for 11/1/2024-11/4/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**216** channels, and **7073** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **766 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Ever since the original [Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192) paper (and variants like [Hydra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05109) and [Medusa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10774)), the community has been in a race to deploy it. In May, Cursor and Fireworks announced their >1000tok/s fast apply model ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-to-be-named-9199/), [Fireworks technical post here](https://fireworks.ai/blog/cursor) - note this issue initially went out with a factual error stating that the speculative decoding API was not released, as this post explains, Fireworks released a spec decoding API 5 months ago.). In August, Zed teased Anthropic's [new Fast Edit mode](https://x.com/zeddotdev/status/1825967818329731104). But Anthropic's API was not released... leaving room for OpenAI to come in swinging:

what this extra processing of draft tokens will cost is a bit more vague ([subject to a 32 token match](https://x.com/nikunjhanda/status/1853603080249716928)), but you can take ~50%  as a nice rule of thumb.

The study also found that **Microsoft Azure** and **Amazon Polly** exhibited linear latency scaling with input length, while open-source models showed more variable performance patterns especially beyond **100-word** inputs.

- **[Hertz-Dev: An Open-Source 8.5B Audio Model for Real-Time Conversational AI with 80ms Theoretical and 120ms Real-World Latency on a Single RTX 4090](https://v.redd.it/5rt1niy7xsyd1)** ([Score: 591, Comments: 78](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gj4wri/hertzdev_an_opensource_85b_audio_model_for/)): **Hertz-Dev**, an open-source **8.5B parameter** audio model, achieves **120ms** real-world latency and **80ms** theoretical latency for conversational AI running on a single **RTX 4090** GPU. The model appears to be designed for real-time audio processing, though no specific implementation details or benchmarking methodology were provided in the post.
  - A **70B parameter version** of Hertz is currently in training, with plans to expand to more modalities. Running this larger model will likely require **H100 GPUs**, though some suggest quantization could help reduce hardware requirements.
  - Discussion around **open source status** emerged, with users noting that only weights and inference code are released (like **Llama**, **Gemma**, **Mistral**). Notable exceptions of fully open source models include **Olmo** and **AMD's 1B model**.
  - The model has a **17-minute context window** and could theoretically be fine-tuned like other transformers using audio datasets. Real-world latency (**120ms**) outperforms **GPT-4o** (**320ms average**) and approaches human conversation gaps (**200-250ms**).


**Theme 2. Voice Cloning Advances: F5-TTS vs RVC vs XTTS2**

- **Speaking with your local LLM with a key press on Linux. Speech to text into any window, most desktop environments. Two hotkeys are the UI.** ([Score: 51, Comments: 1](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1giozl9/speaking_with_your_local_llm_with_a_key_press_on/)): The **BlahST** tool enables **Linux** users to perform local **speech-to-text** and **LLM interactions** using hotkeys, leveraging **whisper.cpp**, **llama.cpp** (or **llamafile**), and **Piper TTS** without requiring Python or JavaScript. Running on a system with **Ryzen** CPU and **RTX3060** GPU, the tool achieves **~34 tokens/second** with **gemma-9b-Q6** model and **90x real-time** speech inference, while maintaining low system resource usage and supporting multilingual capabilities including Chinese translation.

- **Best Open Source Voice Cloning if you have lots of reference audio?** ([Score: 71, Comments: 18](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gj14oa/best_open_source_voice_cloning_if_you_have_lots/)): For voice cloning with **10-20 minutes** of reference audio per character, the author seeks alternatives to **ElevenLabs** and **F5-TTS** for self-hosted deployment. The post specifically requests solutions that allow pre-training models on individual characters for later inference, moving away from few-shot learning approaches like F5-TTS which are optimized for minimal reference audio.
  - **RVC** (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) performs well but requires input audio for conversion. When combined with **XTTS-2**, results can be mixed due to TTS artifacts, though the process is simplified using [alltalk-tts beta](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/tree/alltalkbeta).
  - Fine-tuning **F5-TTS** produced high-quality results with fast inference using [lpscr's implementation](https://github.com/lpscr/F5-TTS), achieving quality comparable to **ElevenLabs**. The process is now integrated into the main repo via `f5-tts_finetune-gradio` command.
  - **GPT-SoVITS**, **MaskCGT**, and **OpenVoice** were mentioned as strong alternatives. **MaskCGT** leads in zero-shot performance, while **GPT-SoVITS** was cited as surpassing fine-tuned **XTTS2** or **F5** reference voice cloning.


**Theme 3. Token Management and Model Optimization Techniques**

- **[MMLU-Pro scores of small models (<5B)](https://i.redd.it/dbqap2z19nyd1.jpeg)** ([Score: 166, Comments: 49](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gii24g/mmlupro_scores_of_small_models_5b/)): **MMLU-Pro** benchmark testing with **10 multiple choice options** per question establishes a **10%** baseline score for random guessing. The test evaluates performance of **language models under 5B parameters**.

- **[tips for dealing with unused tokens? keeps getting clogged](https://v.redd.it/9bteq03a1syd1)** ([Score: 150, Comments: 29](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gj1e9p/tips_for_dealing_with_unused_tokens_keeps_getting/)): **Token usage optimization** in LLMs requires managing both input and output tokens to prevent memory clogs and inefficient processing. The post appears to be asking for advice but lacks specific details about the actual problem being encountered with unused tokens or the LLM system being used.
  - A significant implementation of **KV cache eviction** for unused token removal is being developed in **VLLM**, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/IsaacRe/vllm-kvcompress/tree/main). This approach differs from compression methods used in **llama.cpp** or **exllama**.
  - The community referenced research papers including **DumpSTAR** and **DOCUSATE** for token analysis, with token expiration methods being proposed since [2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06548). 
  - Many users expressed confusion about the post's context, with the top comment noting that responses were polarized between those who fully understood and those completely lost in the technical discussion.

> - `Gradient Norm Clipping`
> - `Duplicate Compile Key in Config`
> - `ForwardKLLoss Misconception`

- **Gradient Norm Clipping Process Explained**: To compute the correct gradient norm, a reduction (sum) across L2 norms of all per-parameter gradients is needed, but this cannot be used for current optimizer steps.
  
  - It may be possible to clip gradient norms in the next iteration, but this alters the original gradient clipping logic.
- **Duplicate Compile Key Issues in Torchtune Config**: A member found a duplicate `compile` key in the configuration file [llama3_1/8B_full.yaml](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/blob/main/recipes/configs/llama3_1/8B_full.yaml#L64-L73), causing it to fail running.
  
  - There is uncertainty if other configuration files have similar issues.
- **ForwardKLLoss Actually Computes Cross-Entropy**: The `ForwardKLLoss` in Torchtune computes cross-entropy rather than KL-divergence as expected, requiring an adjustment to expectations.
  
  - The distinction is important since optimizing KL-divergence effectively means optimizing cross-entropy due to the presence of constant terms.
- **Consider Renaming ForwardKLLoss for Clarity**: There was agreement on the concern regarding the naming of `ForwardKLLoss`, as it could lead to confusion among users.
  
  - It was noted that similar naming practices are utilized in DistiLLM, highlighting the need for clarity when experimenting with `kd_ratio` values.
