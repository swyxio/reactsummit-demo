> - `EfficientQAT`
> - `Memory3 architecture`
> - `Quantization techniques`
> - `Patch-level training` 


- **STORM Proposes New Writing Framework**: The paper introduces **STORM**, a system designed to enhance the pre-writing stage for LLMs by simulating diverse perspectives and curating outlines grounded on reliable sources. An evaluation using the **FreshWiki** dataset shows a 25% improvement in organization and a 10% increase in breadth compared to traditional methods.
   - For full details, refer to the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207).
- **EfficientQAT Maximizes INT Quantization**: The **EfficientQAT** method achieves comparable performance to vector quantization by optimizing uniform INT quantization for Llama-2-70B, resulting in only a **3%** accuracy drop during 2-bit training. This model, trained on a single A100 GPU, demonstrates a memory efficiency advantage, requiring **19.2GB** versus **24.2GB** for the Llama-2-13B.
   - The code is available for review at [OpenGVLab's GitHub](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/EfficientQAT).
- **Memory3: Enhancing LLM Efficiency**: A novel architecture called **Memory3** is introduced to provide an explicit memory mechanism that aims to improve LLM performance and efficiency. The architecture and its implications can be explored [here](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/05/memory3-a-novel-architecture-for-llms-that-introduces-an-explicit-memory-mechanism-to-improve-efficiency-and-performance).
- **Exploring Advanced Quantization Techniques**: The **Spectra LLM** suite showcases 54 models trained on 300B tokens, providing an extensive comparison between different approaches to model compression, including ternary quantization and FloatLMs. Notably, the **TriLM 3.9B** model outperforms prior ternary models while being smaller than half-precision counterparts.
   - This suite addresses the performance dynamics of models trained at low bitwidth, as detailed in the related [arXiv paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2407.12327).
- **Patch-Level Training Revolutionizes LLM Training**: The introduction of **patch-level training** significantly reduces LLM training costs by compressing multiple tokens into single patches, allowing models to process data more efficiently. The method allows for subsequent token-level training to align the model for inference, enhancing overall training speed.
   - Further insights can be found in the [full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12665).

> - `Hugging Face Models on Mac M1`
> - `Model Loading Latency`
> - `Data Sensitivity in Finetuning` 


- **Finetuning Models Performance Comparison Rare**: Members noted that generally, there isn't much comparison of performance between open-sourced models like **Mistral 7B** and **Llama3** with **gpt-3.5-turbo** during finetuning.
   - One member found that **gpt-3.5-turbo** outperformed others and questioned why many avoid finetuning with GPT models due to OpenAI's API data policies.
- **Hugging Face Models on Mac M1 Slow at First**: A user experienced latency when using **Hugging Face** models in a preprocessing pipeline on their **Mac M1** for the first time.
   - Others explained that this slowdown happens because the model loads into memory during the first run, which can be time-consuming especially when testing multiple models.
- **Model Loading and Inference Timing**: To mitigate latency issues, a member suggested that separating the model **loading** and **inference** could help in timing how long each process takes.
   - This approach could provide clearer insights into performance bottlenecks during usage.
- **Sensitivity of Business Data**: Discussion arose about users possibly avoiding the finetuning of models due to concerns about sending sensitive business data, such as customer and patient information, to external companies.
   - This highlights the importance of data privacy considerations in model deployment decisions.
