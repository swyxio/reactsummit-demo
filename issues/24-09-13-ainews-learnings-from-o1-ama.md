> AI News for 9/12/2024-9/13/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**216** channels, and **5103** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **502 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

On day 2 of the o1 release we learned:

- [o1-preview scores 21%](https://x.com/arcprize/status/1834703303621710077?s=46) on ARC-AGI (SOTA is 46%): "In summary, o1 represents a paradigm shift from "memorize the answers" to "memorize the reasoning" but is not a departure from the broader paradigm of fitting a curve to a distribution in order to boost performance by making everything in-distribution."
- [o1-preview scores ~80% on aider code editing](https://aider.chat/2024/09/12/o1.html) (SOTA - Claude 3.5 Sonnet was 77%): "The o1-preview model had trouble conforming to aider’s diff edit format. The o1-mini model had trouble conforming to both the whole and diff edit formats. Aider is extremely permissive and tries hard to accept anything close to the correct formats. It is surprising that such strong models had trouble with the syntactic requirements of simple text output formats. It seems likely that aider could optimize its prompts and edit formats to better harness the o1 models."
- [o1-preview scores ~52% on Cognition-Golden](https://x.com/cognition_labs/status/1834292718174077014?s=46) with [advice](https://x.com/cognition_labs/status/1834292725417730408): "Chain-of-thought and asking the model to “think out loud” are common prompts for previous models. On the contrary, we find that asking o1 to only give the final answer often performs better, since it will think before answering regardless. o1 requires denser context and is more sensitive to clutter and unnecessary tokens. Traditional prompting approaches often involve redundancy in giving instructions, which we found negatively impacted performance with o1."
- [Andrew Mayne's o1 prompting advice](https://x.com/andrewmayne/status/1834408991839158422?s=46): "Don’t think of it like a traditional chat model. Frame o1 in your mind as a really smart friend you’re going to send a DM to solve a problem. She’ll answer back with a very well thought out explanation that walks you through the steps."
- [The OpenAI Research Team AMA](https://x.com/btibor91/status/1834686946846597281) - this last one was best summarized by Tibor Blahe:

- **Efficient int8 and fp16 matrix multiplication**: It was explained that one can perform **fp16 input/int8 matmul** on the GPU without dequantizing, as the int8 weight is directly cast to fp16 inside the kernel.
   - *With the current implementation*, torch.compile generates a mixed-matmul triton kernel, meaning no unnecessary dequantization occurs.
- **Insights on PyTorch quantization techniques**: To reduce memory footprint, trying **int4_weight_only** quantization with bfloat16 or **fp6 quantization (fpx_weight_only(3, 2))** could be beneficial.
   - For further reference on quantization techniques, a link to the [documentation](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/tree/main/torchao/quantization#quantization-techniques) was provided.
- **Discussion on _weight_int8pack_mm Function**: The `_weight_int8pack_mm` function was speculated to operate similarly to how **fp16 input/int8 matmul** is processed by casting the weight matrix to the active data type and applying scaling.
   - This suggests efficient handling of mixed data types within the matrix multiplication operation.
- **Reference to optimum-quanto's kernels**: A reference was made to **optimum-quanto** kernels used for quantization, specifically within their project structure, showcasing non-torchao techniques.
   - The kernels discussed were noted to be detailed in their repository, which could provide insights on alternative approaches.
