Just like [Meta's Coconut](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769) before it, [Huginn's Latent Reasoning Model](https://x.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1888792081382137966) made a splash today. We agree with [Jeremy](https://x.com/jeremyphoward/status/1888815600958656793) and [Andrej](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1835561952258723930) that the best RL will probably not be in English, but we didn't choose this as feature story because presumably DeepSeek already tried that for r1 ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-deepseek-r1-o1-level-open-weights-model/)) and didn't find it worth the tradeoff of not being able to read the thoughts.

> `AI Oversight, Layer Merging in LLMs, OVERTHINK Attack on Reasoning Models` 


- **AI Oversight using Model Similarity**: Recent research proposes a probabilistic metric for **language model similarity** based on model mistakes, aiming to enhance **AI oversight**. This method suggests that **LLMs**-as-judges favor similar models, facilitating weak-to-strong generalization with complementary knowledge.
   - _As model capabilities rise, detecting mistakes becomes more challenging, prompting reliance on AI oversight, a concerning trend in model performance._
- **Merging FFN Layers for Efficiency**: A discussion arose about merging successive **FeedForward Network (FFN)** layers into a **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**, potentially improving computational efficiency. **Parallelizing** similar layers may yield performance gains while maintaining accuracy.
   - _Members theorized that treating merged layers as **experts** could enhance overall model output, though the efficiency of such changes remains uncertain._
- **Innovative OVERTHINK Attack**: A new attack, dubbed **OVERTHINK**, targets reasoning LLMs by injecting complex tasks, causing models to slow down by up to **46×** in inference. This method amplifies reasoning tokens without altering the final output, showcasing vulnerabilities in reasoning models.
   - _By introducing decoy tasks during untrusted contexts, OVERTHINK effectively manipulates inference processes, posing risks for models like OpenAI's o1 and o3-mini._

> `Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), Skip Transcoders, Interpretability in Neural Networks, Partial Rewriting of Transformers, EleutherAI Libraries` 


- **Skip Transcoders outperform Sparse Autoencoders**: Introducing **skip transcoders** shows a **Pareto improvement** over **SAEs**, with enhanced **interpretability** and fidelity in neural networks. You can utilize skip transcoders by using flags `--transcode` and `--skip_connection` in the [sparsify](https://github.com/EleutherAI/sparsify) library.
   - *Unlike SAEs*, transcoders better approximate input-output relationships, thereby improving the approach to interpretability.
- **Disappointing results in partial rewriting**: In research on partially rewriting transformers, the team trained a skip transcoder on the sixth layer of **Pythia 160M** but faced lackluster results. They *failed to outperform* a simple baseline of using a zero vector in place of the transcoder.
   - Despite these setbacks, they remain optimistic about refining their methods for more detailed and precise explanations.
- **Interest in Interpretability Research**: The team expresses excitement about improving model interpretability, suggesting they are seeking collaboration and involvement from others. Discussions are ongoing in the **#1153431135414669422** channel for anyone who wants to contribute.
   - Thanks were given to contributors for their work on both the skip transcoder and partial rewriting papers.
- **Links to Recent Research Papers**: The team shared links to their newly published papers, including the [skip transcoder paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18823) and the [partial rewriting paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18838). Both papers advance the understanding of mechanistic interpretability in neural networks.
   - Highlights from the abstracts underscore the significance of these architectures in enhancing human-understandable frameworks for machine learning.

> `Reinforcement Learning in AI Agents, PlanExe AI Project, LLMs and Token Counting Limitations` 


- **Questioning RL Definitions in AI Agents**: One member explored whether using **VectorDB** to store lessons as embeddings constitutes true **Reinforcement Learning** (RL), questioning if genuine RL can be implemented without fine-tuning hosted LLMs.
   - They seek insights on simulating RL-like behavior and also inquired about relevant papers on **agentic frameworks** with RL implementations.
- **Introducing PlanExe: A Structured AI Planner**: Another member presented their project, **PlanExe**, created with **LlamaIndex** and **OpenRouter**, capable of generating structured plans like SWOT analyses without deep web searching.
   - They shared a [GitHub link](https://github.com/neoneye/PlanExe) to the project, expressing uncertainty about the accuracy of the outputs it generates.
- **LLMs Struggling with Token Count**: A member pointed out that LLMs have difficulty counting tokens in their context, indicating a broader issue with tokenization not being the only problem in counting characters in words.
   - This was further emphasized by another user who remarked that **LLMs can't count at all**.

> `ELEGNT Video Discussion, Guardrails in Drug Discovery Algorithms, Guardrails for Bioweapons Discovery, Anthropic's Information Output` 


- **ELEGNT Video on Robot Movement**: A YouTube video titled **ELEGNT: Expressive and Functional Movement Design for Non-Anthropomorphic Robot** was shared [here](https://youtu.be/IHJa_CyJjdc?feature=shared). The video is currently undefined in description but relates to movement design.
   - The discussion around this video emphasizes innovative movement techniques applied to robot design.
- **Algorithm Shifts in Drug Discovery**: There's concern that a drug discovery algorithm switched from **toxicity minimizing** to **maximizing**, resulting in discovering **40,000** potential bioweapons in just **6 hours**. The implication is that guardrails are ineffective against broader knowledge synthesis.
   - It raises questions about the algorithm's focus on specific topics while potentially neglecting more harmful compounds.
- **Guardrails' Impact on Bioweapons Discovery**: The possibility exists that guardrails intended for one specific **nerve gas** could lead to overlooking numerous harmful compounds. There's an awareness that discovering other bioweapons merely requires applying the same methodology to millions of compounds.
   - Critiques suggest that by narrowing their focus, creators might inadvertently create blind spots in their safety measures.
- **Anthropic's Information Handling Critique**: A member criticized that Anthropic's outputs often offer **partial information**, creating a false sense of security. Even when outputs contain valuable pieces of information, the perception of safety lagged behind the actual effectiveness.
   - This highlights a fundamental gap between advertised safety measures and real-world applications while addressing complex concerns.
