We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**466** channels, and **2228** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **248 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Lots of small updates here and there - [HuggingFace's SmolLM](https://x.com/xenovacom/status/1813258097185448377) replicated MobileLLM ([our coverage](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-to-be-named-3686/) just a week ago), Yi Tay wrote up the [Death of BERT](https://www.yitay.net/blog/model-architecture-blogpost-encoders-prefixlm-denoising) ([our podcast](https://x.com/latentspacepod/status/1809300018907828285) 2 weeks ago), and [1 square block of San Francisco](https://x.com/evanjconrad/status/1813297376544854063) raised/sold for well over $30m in deals across [Exa](https://x.com/evanjconrad/status/1813308202534211998), [SFCompute](https://x.com/evanjconrad/status/1813293874288472493), and [Brev](https://x.com/NaderLikeLadder/status/1813286240093151412) (congrats friends!).

However our technical highlight of today is [SciCode](https://x.com/MinyangTian1/status/1813182904593199553), which challenges LMs to code solutions for scientific problems from advanced papers. The challenges were crafted by PhDs (~10% is based on Nobel-winning research) and the two leading LLMs, GPT-4 and Sonnet 3.5, score <5% on this new benchmark.

Other than HumanEval and MBPP, the next claim to a top coding benchmark has been SWEBench ([more info on our coverage](https://www.latent.space/p/iclr-2024-benchmarks-agents), but it is expensive to run and more so an integration test of agentic systems rather than test of pure coding ability/world knowledge. SciCode provides a nice extension of the very popular HumanEval approach that is easy/cheap to run, and nevertheless still is remarkably difficult for SOTA LLMs, providing a nice gradient to run. 

Nothing lasts forever ([SOTA SWEbench went from 2% to 40% in 6 months](https://x.com/Douglas_Schon/status/1813213722770354177)) but new and immediately applicable benchmark work is very nice when done well.

- **Unexpected FakeTensor weights after compilation**: A member was confused about `unwrap_tensor_subclass` seemingly replacing all subclass tensors with **FakeTensors** in their model, which led to issues because these aren't handled as packed tensors.
   - *I thought FakeTensors were only used for compilation, not while running the compiled function,* the member remarked.
- **Parametrization workaround in torch.compile**: Another member clarified that `unwrap_tensor_subclass` uses **parametrization** to convert tensor subclasses to plain tensors to navigate the current limitation of **torch.compile stack** (especially aot_export).

- **Mirror neurons represent features in superposition**: A discussion arose about the possibility that **mirror neurons** are simply representing features in correlated superposition.
   - This could imply that neural circuits can be reused for different functions, a fascinating twist on current neurological theories.
- **Further implications on circuit reuse**: *Mirror neurons* reusing circuits in superposition could reshape understandings of brain efficiency.
   - Such theories could potentially lead to new perspectives in both **AI** and neuroscience research.

- **Tokenization consistency in MLX and HF models**: A member noticed differences in tokenization between the MLX and HF models, particularly focusing on the handling of the **BOS token** and the lack of other prompt formatting without using `apply_chat_templates`.
   - *Gemma* model’s underperformance without the **BOS token** was highlighted as a specific concern.
- **Chat template option in tokenization**: It was mentioned that using the `--apply_chat_template` option wraps the examples in a chat template before tokenization.
   - There was some confusion about whether this option is specific to **HF model args** or a top-level **lm-eval** option.
- **Top-level lm-eval options and their impact**: The discussion clarified that `--apply_chat_template` is indeed a top-level **lm-eval** option.
   - The proper method for ensuring **MLX models** receive the same parameters as **HF models** was also sought.

> - `LLM Response Sources`
> - `Service Context and Indexing Models`
> - `Vector Datasets and Tools`
> - `Parallel Index Loading`
> - `PropertyGraphIndex Embeddings` 


- **Retrieving LLM Response Sources in Queries**: To get the source of the LLM response while querying over text files, use the `get_formatted_sources()` method on the response object, or `display_eval_sources()` function for evaluation results ([more details](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/docs/docs/examples/vector_stores/SimpleIndexDemo.ipynb)).
   - These methods return the sources of the response in a formatted manner, useful for debugging and understanding data provenance.
- **Clarification on Service Context and Embedding Models**: Recent versions of LlamaIndex no longer require the `serviceContext`; you can set LLM/embedding models globally or pass them directly into relevant modules ([LLM customization docs](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/models/llms/usage_custom/#example-changing-the-underlying-llm)).
   - For example, you can pass `gpt-4o` into the query engine directly, simplifying custom setups as opposed to using default embeddings.
- **Seeking Public Vector Datasets for Easy Access**: Members are looking for services that host public vector datasets like Wikipedia to avoid the infrastructure overhead of hosting their own.
   - One suggestion was to host one’s own Wikipedia vector store, though the preference remains for pre-hosted, query-ready services.
- **Optimizing Index Loading for Large Datasets**: A member reported that loading large indexes takes a considerable amount of time and inquired about methods to speed this up, such as parallel processing.
   - The discussion suggests using `QueryPipelines` or other methods to optimize and potentially parallelize the loading process.
- **Embedding Data in PropertyGraphIndex**: The `PropertyGraphIndex.from_documents()` method is where embeddings are created for storage in Neo4J nodes ([source code](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/f092d90bd5934097f5c166014f5d99a3e07ea999/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/indices/property_graph/base.py#L248)).
   - This section of the source code details the embedding creation process to store data effectively in the graph database.

- **Optimizing Checkpoint Selection**: The original query focused on finding the best checkpoint without overfitting by calculating eval loss at each step.
   - The suggested workaround included evaluating the dataset for each epoch until a more detailed per-step evaluation setup could be implemented.

> - `Scaling RoPE Embeddings`
> - `Long Context Modeling` 


- **RFC for scaling RoPE embeddings for long contexts**: The [RFC](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/issues/1183) discusses adding RoPE scaling methods to support long context modeling for tasks like large document understanding or code completion.
   - *In order for this to be enabled by default, a model would need to support context lengths greater than 8K*.
- **Long context modeling for large documents**: For large document understanding or tasks like code completion, it is often beneficial to have a large context length, e.g., greater than 8K.
   - The RFC suggests methods to scale up RoPE embeddings to accommodate such requirements.
