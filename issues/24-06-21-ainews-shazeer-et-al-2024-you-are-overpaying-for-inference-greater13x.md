  compared to late 2022, with leading commercial APIs costing at least **13.5X

We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**415** channels, and **2822** messages) for you.

In a concise 962 word blogpost, [Noam Shazeer](https://x.com/NoamShazeer/status/1803790708358410380) returned to writing to explain how Character.ai serves **20% of Google Search Traffic** for LLM inference, while reducing serving costs by a factor of 33 (compared to late 2022), estimating that **leading commercial APIs would cost at least 13.5X more**:

**Memory-efficiency**: "We use the following techniques to reduce KV cache size by more than 20X without regressing quality. With these techniques, GPU memory is no longer a bottleneck for serving large batch sizes."

1. **MQA > GQA**: "reduces KV cache size by 8X compared to the Grouped-Query Attention adopted in most open source models." ([Shazeer, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150?ref=research.character.ai))
2. **Hybrid attention horizons**: a 1:5 ratio of local (sliding window) attention layers to global ([Beltagy et al 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150v2))
3. **Cross Layer KV-sharing**: local attention layers share KV cache with 2-3 neighbors, global layers share cache across blocks. ([Brandon et al 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12981?ref=research.character.ai))

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/861fadcb-48e1-484f-b22c-e40b0b1f199e.png?w=960&fit=max) 

**Stateful Caching**: "On Character.AI, the majority of chats are long dialogues; the average message has a dialogue history of 180 messages... To solve this problem, we developed an inter-turn caching system."

4. **Cached KV tensors in a LRU cache with a tree structure** (RadixAttention, [Zheng et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07104?ref=research.character.ai)) At a fleet level, we use sticky sessions to route the queries from the same dialogue to the same server. Our system achieves a 95% cache rate.
5. **Native int8 precision**: as opposed to the more common "post-training quantization". Requiring their own customized int8 kernels for matrix multiplications and attention - with a future post on quantized training promised.

- **Experimenting with domain adaptation**: *"I need to get other work done, but will check out domain adaptation when I get back to it,"* noted one user, expressing eagerness to explore further after successful training runs.
- **Finetuning model issues**: Numerous users experienced problems with saving and loading fine-tuned models, particularly when using `save_pretrained_merged()`. Recommendations included using simpler save methods and avoiding 16bit quantization, which seemed to cause issues.
- **Debating DPO vs RLHF**: Users discussed switching from Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) for ease and efficacy, as DPO is supported by Unsloth and involves simpler training datasets. *"I was thinking to start with RFHF and then check DPO, but now after checking more about DPO, I think i wil switch to DPO first."*
- **Deployment challenges with Hugging Face**: Users shared issues deploying Unsloth-trained models via Hugging Face Inference endpoints due to tokenizer errors. One user sought advice on best deployment platforms using various credits, with responses pending further details.

- **Estimate Training Time: Simple Formula vs Practical Execution**: A member asked if training time can be estimated by multiplying token train rate, dataset token size, and estimated epoch number. Another member suggested the most reliable way is to "Run the training and see the estimate after a few steps" and to add some buffer time for evaluation.

- **Formatting Data for Tool Calling Models**: One member sought advice on transforming a dataset into a format compatible with **axolotl** using `<|tool_call|>` tokens. Another suggested looking at **example configs** that include ShareGPT settings for guidance on formatting.

- **Discord API version update in the works**: A member inquired if **Cohere's API** supports **OpenAI-style roles** like "user" or "assistant". Another member clarified that the **current API does not** but a new version is being developed that will accommodate these roles to ease integration.
- **Incompatibility with OpenAI ChatCompletion**: Multiple users discussed how **Cohere's Chat API** is not compatible with **OpenAI's ChatCompletion API**, mentioning that many services adopt **OpenAI's API** while Cohere does not. Other models and services have **diverging APIs**, complicating universal integration.
- **Concerns over model integrity in services like OpenRouter**: Members expressed skepticism about services like **OpenRouter**, fearing they might swap out requested models for cheaper alternatives based on the prompt. One user suggested using **raw prompts and side-by-side comparisons** to verify the model provided.
- **Link to personal blog on resource hoarding**: A user shared a [blog post](https://jerry.wtf/posts/use-your-potions/) comparing the hoarding of single-use items in RPG games to avoiding asking for favors or promoting projects in real life. They discussed how this mindset changed after playing Baldur's Gate 3, where they decided to use resources as intended, which turned out to be fun.
