And it brought a raft of notable announcements ([full blogpost here](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/universe-2024-previews-releases/)): mostly being GitHub's takes on popular code AI tools.

1. **Multi-model Copilot**: adding Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, and OpenAI’s o1-preview in a new model picker UI. Copilot's base model has moved from Codex, GPT3.5, GPT4, 4o, and 4o-mini, but for the first time developers get to choose models from other companies including Google. This was big enough to [reach mainstream media today](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41985915) and one can't help but tie this story with [reports of a "fraying" Microsoft-OpenAI partnership](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41878281).

![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8a2b9c1-5e49-4eb4-aafc-4ecb527cb222)

Cassidy Williams also demoed the [new multi-file editing capability of Copilot](https://x.com/ashtom/status/1851316495336554663) and [a custom instructions file](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot) - analogous to **the Composer and .cursorrules features of Cursor.**

2. [**GitHub Spark**](https://githubnext.com/projects/github-spark): "*the AI-native tool to build applications entirely in natural language. Sparks are fully functional micro apps that can integrate AI features and external data sources without requiring any management of cloud resources.*" basically their v0 and bolt.new and Claude Artifacts competitor, complete with **deployment-free hosting, themable design system, persistent data storage, and integrated model prompting**.

> "Utilizing a creativity feedback loop, users start with an initial prompt, see live previews of their app as it’s built, easily see options for each of their requests, and automatically save versions of each iteration so they can compare versions as they go."

![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/4118995e-d456-4fad-a064-b60035f9b519)


The presenters also discussed the latest [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models) (now off waitlist), and last year's big launch, Copilot [Workspace and Code Reviews](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-10-29-github-copilot-code-review-in-github-com-public-preview/) (now with 2 more agents: Brainstorm and Build/Repair, to the existing 3 Spec/Plan/Implement agents, with a new VSCode extension) and [security Autofix](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-09-18-now-available-for-free-on-all-public-repositories-copilot-autofix-for-codeql-code-scanning-alerts/) updates.

**[This issue brought to you by Weights & Biases]!**: Your LLMs aren't just text-only anymore - so why should your observability be?

Weave from Weights & Biases [now supports](https://usewb.link/swyx-docs) audio tracing alongside text, images and other modalities. With just 3 lines of code, track every input, output and metadata across your multimodal AI stack.

Try it yourself in [our interactive Colab notebook](https://usewb.link/Hw0HGuU)!

> swyx commentary: this notebook looks short, but IMO the gold is the 19 cells hidden under "Advanced Usage: Realtime Audio API with Weave"! You wouldn't expect a normal LLM Ops product to have updated to support the OpenAI Realtime API so soon, but it looks like the WandB team have been cooking.

- **Exploring Quantization Without LoRA**: Members are discussing whether base models can be quantized like QLoRA without applying LoRA, suggesting potential challenges in configuring non-LoRA model builders.
  
  - *Hmmm I guess the main thing is we don't have a way to configure this in our non-LoRA model builders.*
- **FSDP and CPU Offloading Capabilities**: It was noted that FSDP currently offers a single parameter for CPU offloading that encompasses parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, with no finer control available.
  
  - *This approach has more data movements, but potentially faster since optimizer step is on GPU* was offered as a consideration for performance.
- **Discussing Quantized KV-Caches Usage**: There's skepticism about the utility of quantized KV-caches using NF4 tensors given this type of cache consumes significant memory, especially in larger models.
  
  - *I don't think quantized kv cached in torchao is that useful/powerful yet,* indicating doubts about its effectiveness.
- **Challenges with Frozen Model Weights**: The conversation also highlighted that quantizing non-trainable parts of models, like frozen weights during PPO, could help reduce memory usage.
  
  - One participant expressed their interest by noting, *Yeah I'd like to do something similar and quantize the non-trainable models during PPO.*
- **Concerns on Quantizing to Below 8-bit**: Discussion arose around the accuracy issues that may occur when quantizing activations, specifically KV caches, below 8-bit.
  
  - *Quantizing activations to below 8bit will have pretty severe accuracy issues,* revealing caution toward aggressive quantization.
