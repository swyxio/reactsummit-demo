> AI News for 7/19/2024-7/22/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**474** channels, and **7039** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **765 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

We know it's coming tomorrow (with [Soumith's ICML keynote](https://x.com/soumithchintala/status/1814704963332767833)), so we really tried to avoid discussing the leaks since we're going to be covering it tomorrow, but Llama 3.1 is leaking like a sieve ([weights](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1815371623815356751), [evals](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1815459760227168764), [model card](https://pastebin.com/clone/9jGkYbXY)) that is leaky, so unfortunately it is all the community is talking about today, despite a lot of it being repeats of the [first Llama 3 release in April](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-llama-3/).

Apart from the well telegraphed 405B dense model release, here are the diffs to Llama 3.1 as far as we can tell, mostly from the [model card](https://pastebin.com/clone/9jGkYbXY) spells out the various priorities they had:

- "The Llama 3.1 instruction tuned text only models (8B, 70B, 405B) are optimized for **multilingual** dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source and closed chat models on common industry benchmarks."
- Explicitly advertising "Multilingual text **and code** as an output modality
- every model bumped up to **128k context length** (up from 8k)
- Training utilized a cumulative of **39.3M GPU hours** of computation on H100-80GB (TDP of 700W): 1.5m for 8B, 7m for 70B, 31M for 405B.
-  Llama 3.1 was pretrained on ~15 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as **over 25M synthetically generated examples**.
- sizable bumps to the 8B and 70B benchmarks (MMLU from 65 to 73 for the 8B (+8 points), and from 81 to 86 for the 70B (+5 points), and MATH from 29 to 52 (+23 points) for the 8B 

We [made a diff spreadsheet](https://x.com/swyx/status/1815553411808653513) to visualize - TLDR, HUGE bump for the 8B, across the board and instruct 70b is mildly better. 405B is still behind flagship models.:

However some [independently run evals have Llama 3.1 70b doing better than GPT 4o](https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1815444612414087294) - jury still out.

- **Achieving High Accuracy with Implicit CoT in GPT-2**: A new method is proposed to internalize **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** steps by starting with a model trained for explicit CoT, gradually removing intermediate steps, and finetuning it, enabling a **GPT-2 Small** model to solve 9-by-9 multiplication with 99% accuracy ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14838)).
   - The same method improves performance in larger models like **Mistral 7B**, achieving over 50% accuracy on GSM8K without producing any intermediate steps.
- **Seeking Papers on Multi-turn User-Agent Interactions**: A member is seeking recommendations for papers similar to **UltraChat** that discuss building multi-turn user-agent interactions and mentions the **SODA** paper as a potential read ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10465)).
   - "The SODA paper is cited in UltraChat for having a similar average number of turns in a given figure."
- **Factuality and Reasoning Improved by Multiagent Debate**: A new approach enhances **factuality and reasoning** in language models through multiagent debate, where multiple language model instances propose and debate responses over multiple rounds ([composable-models](https://composable-models.github.io/llm_debate/)).
   - This method significantly improves mathematical and strategic reasoning across various tasks.

> - `Human-like Response Time in CNNs`
> - `Efficient Dictionary Learning with Switch SAE` 


- **Self-models Simplify Neural Networks**: The paper on [self-models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10188) shows that networks predicting their internal states as an auxiliary task become simpler and more regularized, making them more parameter-efficient.
   - However, the results using datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, and IMDB show expectations rather than surprising insights, with some members questioning the novelty of these findings.
- **Implementing Hybrid Post-Quantum Encryption**: The [liboqs-python GitHub repository](https://github.com/qompassai/liboqs-python) describes using Kyber/Dilithium python bindings and Podman for rootless container management to implement hybrid post-quantum encryption.
   - This approach aims to minimize attack surfaces during this vulnerable time, showcasing advancements in secure encryption techniques.
- **Feature Contamination Limits OOD Generalization**: A paper on [out-of-distribution generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03345) finds that neural networks suffer from feature contamination, where irrelevant features can hinder their performance.
   - The discussion suggests that inductive biases and SGD dynamics play a crucial role, hinting at a potential unified theory to explain model failures.
- **RTNet Mimics Human Response Times**: The [RTNet model](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.23.505015v2.full) reproduces human-like response times and confidence in decision-making by utilizing stochastic decisions.
   - Although the model's practical applications are debatable, it provides an accurate prediction of human behavior on image classification tasks by using sampled Gaussian weights.
- **Switch SAE for Efficient Dictionary Learning**: A new architecture, [Switch SAE](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/47CYFbrSyiJE2X5ot/efficient-dictionary-learning-with-switch-sparse), is proposed for scaling sparse autoencoders efficiently, aiming to recover features from superintelligent language models.
   - Leveraging conditional computation, Switch SAE offers a practical solution to scale SAEs to billions of features, overcoming current computational limitations.
