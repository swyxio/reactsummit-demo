description: >-
  **DeepSeek** released **DeepSeek R1**, a significant upgrade over **DeepSeek
  V3** from just three weeks prior, featuring 8 models including full-size 671B
  MoE models and multiple distillations from **Qwen 2.5** and **Llama 3.1/3.3**.
  The models are MIT licensed, allowing finetuning and distillation. Pricing is
  notably cheaper than **o1** by 27x-50x. The training process used **GRPO**
  (reward for correctness and style outcomes) without relying on PRM, MCTS, or
  reward models, focusing on reasoning improvements through reinforcement
  learning. Distilled models can run on **Ollama** and show strong capabilities
  like writing **Manim code**. The release emphasizes advances in
  **reinforcement-learning**, **fine-tuning**, and **model-distillation** with a
  novel RL framework from DeepSeekMath.

> AI News for 1/17/2025-1/20/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **34** Discords (**225** channels, and **8019** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **910 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

We knew that we'd get an open weights release of DeepSeek at some point, and DeepSeek is already well known for their papers and [V3 was the top open model in the world](https://www.latent.space/p/baseten), but all our AI sources could not take their eyes off the DeepSeek R1 release today.

R1's performance which turned out to be leaps and bounds above [DeepSeek V3 from literally 3 weeks ago](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-deepseek-v3-671b-finegrained-moe-trained/):

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b70431e4-c259-4163-af25-e4f1d14b5b4e.png?w=960&fit=max)

When we say "R1", it's ambiguous. DeepSeek actually dropped 8 R1 models - 2 "full" models, and 6 distillations on open models:

- from Qwen 2.5: finetuned with 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, in 1.5B, 7B, 14B, and 32B
- from Llama 3.1 8B Base: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B 
- from Llama3.3-70B-Instruct: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B
- and **DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero**, the full-size, 671B MoE models similar to [DeepSeek V3](https://www.latent.space/p/baseten). Surprisingly, [MIT licensed](https://x.com/deepseek_ai/status/1881318138937233664?s=46) rather than custom licenses, including explicit OK for finetuning and distillation

Other notables from the launch:

- **Pricing** (per million tokens): 14 cents input (cache hit), 55 cents input (cache miss), and 219 cents output. This compares to o1 at 750 cents input (cache hit), 1500 cents input (cache miss), 6000 cents output. **That's 27x-50x cheaper than o1.**
- [solves every problem from the o1 blogpost](https://x.com/mrsiipa/status/1881330071874813963). [every one](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/1881453058556870934?s=46).
- [can run the distilled models on ollama](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/20/deepseek-r1/)
- can write [manim code](https://x.com/christiancooper/status/1881335734256492605) really well


Surprises from [the paper](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf):

- The process was:
  1. [V3 Base → R1 Zero](https://x.com/casper_hansen_/status/1881404608591085817) (using GRPO - aka reward for correctness and style outcomes - no fancy PRM/MCTS/RMs)
  2. [R1 Zero → R1 Finetuned Cold Start](https://x.com/casper_hansen_/status/1881404611401236745) (distil long CoT samples from R1 Zero)
  3. [R1 Cold Start → R1 Reasoner with RL](https://x.com/casper_hansen_/status/1881404614190506188) (focus on language consistency - to produce readable reasoning)
  4. [R1 Reasoning → R1 Finetuned-Reasoner](https://x.com/casper_hansen_/status/1881404617235509711) (Generate 600k: multi-response sampling and only keep correct samples (using prev rules) and using V3 as a judge: filter out mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code)
  5. [R1 Instruct-Reasoner → R1 Aligned](https://x.com/casper_hansen_/status/1881404619362013294) (Balance reasoning with helpfulness and harmlessness using GRPO)
- [Visualized](https://x.com/SirrahChan/status/1881488738473357753): ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/c2e152cb-1ae5-4c2e-88fe-39d6b0fb411b.png?w=960&fit=max)

- but they do use [GRPO from DeepSeekMath](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300) ([challenged by the DPO author](https://x.com/rm_rafailov/status/1881350883252085000)) as "the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning" where reasoning (like [in-context back-tracking](https://x.com/paul_cal/status/1881324020592963939)) "naturally emerged" after "thousands of RL steps" - [not quite](https://x.com/cto_junior/status/1881319502861967635) the famous o1 scaling plot, but a close cousin. ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/53113db9-e27c-4f57-9a0e-3c2ddf68d842.png?w=960&fit=max)
- using ["aha moments"](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/1881317131561922640) as pivot tokens, often [mixing languages in a reader unfriendly way](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/1881329351125549144)
- R1 [began training less than a month after the o1 announcement](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/1881298065967239183)
- R1 distillations were [remarkably effective](https://x.com/nrehiew_/status/1881330794549182853), giving us [this insane quote](https://x.com/reach_vb/status/1881319500089634954): "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-**1.5B outperforms GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet** on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH.", and this is [without even pushing the distillation to their limits](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/1881331287010550119). 
- This is [more effective than just RL-tuning a small model](https://x.com/DimitrisPapail/status/1881341537499619822): "[reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models.](https://x.com/qtnx_/status/1881330757001502991)" aka "total SFT victory"

> `Host RAM Requirements, Vocab Size Optimization, 3D Parallelism with ZeRO Stage 1, Issue Raising for Hangs, Updating Markdown Files` 


- **Host RAM and CPU Core Guidance**: Host RAM should be roughly equivalent to GPU VRAM, with optimizations like **CPU Adam** increasing memory demands. Typically, 2–4 cores per GPU suffices, depending on CPU architecture and pipeline complexity.
   - *A good rule of thumb is to have host RAM equivalent to the required GPU VRAM*, while training can often function with less.
- **Vocab Size Divisibility for Efficiency**: Vocab size should be made divisible by **128*MP** for optimization, though it can be overridden at your own risk. The risks of deviating from this norm were communicated by a member.
   - It is noted that overriding the default setting is *not highly recommended* as it may lead to complications.
- **Exploring MP, PP, and ZeRO Stage 1**: Members discussed the benefits of using **MP+PP+ZeRO Stage 1** for optimizing performance and improving throughput. Activation of **memory optimizations** and **flash attention** were suggested as effective enhancements.
   - *Double the initial flops* was reported as an achievement with these methods, although some caution around trusting maximum reported flops was advised.
- **Raising Issues for Hangs**: A user expressed the intention to raise an issue regarding a hang in the process, asking for detailed information about their setup. They assured that they would address it upon finding time amidst their travels.
   - Another member reminded the user to include detailed information so that the hang issue might be resolved efficiently.
- **Improving ARGS Markdown File**: There was a suggestion to reexport the **ARGS markdown file** since it lacked certain parameters. This indicates a potential oversight that could help clarify usage and configurations for users.

> `O1 pro streaming summary, Test-time search vs forward passes, Use of self-consistency in reasoning, Gflownet in training O1, Asymmetry in RL setups` 


- **O1 pro streams thought summaries while reasoning**: A member observed that **O1 pro** streams a summary of its thoughts as they occur, suggesting it merges parallel generations during the thought process instead of at the end.
   - *Streaming summaries would indicate intermediate selection*, as opposed to a final sample selection.
- **Test-time search explanations debated**: Discussion arose around **Francois Chollet's** tweet explaining that instant model responses indicate fewer than 10 forward passes, while longer responses involve test-time search.
   - Some members suggested that this interpretation may not accurately reflect how the **O1 pro** operates during inference.
- **Theory on latent reasoning paths in training**: **Chygao** posited that training for O1 involved using methodologies like **Gflownet** to derive latent reasoning paths, citing a paper that received mention at **ICLR 2024**.
   - This paper explores deriving hidden **chains of thought** leading to an answer through **Bayesian inference**.
- **Discussion on RL asymmetry concerns**: **Catboy_slim_** questioned whether the asymmetrical clipping of negatives and positives in their RL setup was intentional, ultimately recognizing it as common in standard PPO configurations.
   - This asymmetry could soften positive examples while exacerbating negatives, raising questions about stability justifications that weren't fully aligned with their mathematical model.
- **Understanding rewards and penalties in RL**: In the RL discussion, **Natolambert** highlighted that in traditional setups, negatives equate to failure while small rewards are akin to progress.
   - This notion aligns with the justification for non-standard clipping approaches in training, though it raised concerns about the interplay with underlying model mathematics.
