> AI News for 8/28/2024-8/29/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**400** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**213** channels, and **2980** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **338 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

One of the core theses in [the Rise of the AI Engineer](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer) is that code is first among equals among the many modalities that will emerge. Above the obvious virtuous cycle (code faster -> train faster -> code faster), it also has the nice property of being 1) internal facing (so lower but nonzero liability of errors), 2) improving developer productivity (one of the most costly headcounts), 3) verifiable/self-correcting (in [the Let's Verify Step by Step](https://www.latent.space/p/iclr-2024-benchmarks-agents) sense).

This Summer of Code kicked off with: 

- [**Cognition (Devin) raising $175m**](https://www.maginative.com/article/cognition-ai-raises-175m-at-2b-valuation-one-month-after-series-a/) (still under very restricted waitlist)  (their [World's Fair talk here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7NWjoD_OuY))
- [**Poolside raising $400m**](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/20/poolside-raising-400m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-supercharged-coding-copilot/) (still [mostly](https://x.com/poolsideai/status/1738669662467178581) stealth)

Today, we have:

- [**Codeium AI raising $150m**](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/29/github-copilot-competitor-codeium-raises-150m-at-a-1-25b-valuation/?guccounter=1) on top of their January $65m raise (their [World's Fair talk here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuZXbinJ4Uc))
- [**Magic raising $320m**](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/29/generative-ai-coding-startup-magic-lands-320m-investment-from-eric-schmidt-atlassian-and-others/) on top of their $100m Febuary raise, announcing [LTM-2](https://magic.dev/blog/100m-token-context-windows), officially confirming their rumored 100m token context model, though still remaining in stealth.

While [Codeium](https://codeium.com/) is the only product of the 4 you can actually use today, Magic's announcement is the more notable one, because of their promising long context utilization (powered by [HashHop](https://github.com/magicproduct/hash-hop)) and efficiency details teased by Nat Friedman in the previous raise:

> For each decoded token, LTM-2-mini’s sequence-dimension algorithm is **roughly 1000x cheaper than the attention mechanism** in Llama 3.1 405B1 for a 100M token context window. The contrast in memory requirements is even larger – running Llama 3.1 405B with a 100M token context requires **638 H100s per user** just to store a single 100M token KV cache. In contrast, LTM requires a** small fraction of a single H100’s HBM per user** for the same context.

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/91a9b5ec-5099-472c-9aad-91c506e60418.png?w=960&fit=max) 

This was done with a completely-written-from-scratch stack:

> To train and serve 100M token context models, we needed to **write an entire training and inference stack from scratch** (no torch autograd, lots of custom CUDA, no open-source foundations) and run experiment after experiment on how to stably train our models.

They also announced a Google Cloud partnership: 

> Magic-G4, powered by NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, and Magic-G5, powered by NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, with the ability to scale to tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs over time.

They mention 8000 h100s now, but "over time, we will scale up to tens of thousands of GB200s" with former OpenAI Supercomputing Lead Ben Chess.

Their next frontier is **inference-time compute**:

> **Imagine if you could spend $100 and 10 minutes on an issue and reliably get a great pull request for an entire feature.** That’s our goal.

### **Unsloth AI (Daniel Han) ▷ #[general](https://discord.com/channels/1179035537009545276/1179035537529643040/1278429326580125759)** (93 messages🔥🔥): 

> - `Unsloth vs OpenRLHF`
> - `Unsloth finetuning`
> - `Unsloth multi-GPU`
> - `Unsloth inference`
> - `Unsloth on AWS` 


- **Unsloth vs OpenRLHF: Speed & Memory**: Unsloth uses 4-bit quantization to achieve much faster training speeds and lower VRAM usage compared to OpenRLHF.
   - While Unsloth currently only supports 4-bit quantized models for finetuning, they are working on adding support for 8-bit and unquantized models.  They claim there is no tradeoff in performance or replicability between the methods.
- **Unsloth Finetuning on AWS**: Unsloth doesn't have a dedicated guide for finetuning on AWS.
   - However, some users are using Sagemaker to finetune models on AWS, and there are numerous YouTube videos and Google Colab examples for Unsloth.
- **Unsloth Multi-GPU Support**: Unsloth currently does not support multi-GPU training.
   - This means you cannot train models larger than what fits on a single GPU, even though the 70B model only requires 48GB of VRAM when using 4-bit quantization.
- **Unsloth Model Merging**: You can merge an adapter with a base model by uploading both to Hugging Face and using the `model.push_to_hub_merged` function.
   - You can save the merged model in 4-bit format using the `save_method = 'merged_4bit_forced'` argument.
- **Unsloth EOS Token Mapping**: The `map_eos_token = True` option in Unsloth allows you to map the `<|im_end|>` token to the `</s>` token without training, which can be necessary for specific chat templates.
   - This mapping can help avoid gibberish outputs, as some models expect only one `<|im_end|>` token at the end of the prompt, and may require replacing other `<|im_end|>` tokens with `</s>` when finetuning with multi-turn prompts.

> - `Sycophancy Behavior in Models`
> - `MMlu Issues`
> - `COT & Scratch Pad Evaluation` 


- **LLMs don't see letters, they see tokens**: A member pointed out that all the talk of counting characters with LLMs is a red herring as models don't see letters, they see tokens which are like a big list of words.
   - They gave the example of reading kanji in Japanese, which is more similar to how LLMs work than reading letters in English.
- **Does Claude have 'sycophancy behavior'?**: A member asked if LLMs have a tendency to be sycophantic, especially when it comes to reasoning.
   - Another member suggested adding system messages to help with this, but said even then, it's more of a parlor trick than a useful production tool.
- **MMlu not a good benchmark for real-world use**: One member noted that MMLu isn't a good benchmark for building useful LLMs because it's not strongly correlated with real-world use cases.
   - They pointed to examples of questions on Freud's outdated theories on sexuality, implying the benchmark isn't reflective of what users need from LLMs.
- **COT and Scratch Pad Evaluation are still in early stages**: One member said they don't care about MMlu as it's only for the delta - a 'vibe check' - and that they're waiting for new releases.
   - Another member agreed, saying they want a graph of thought with scratchpad evaluation, but they lack the necessary GPUs.
