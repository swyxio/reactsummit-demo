description: >-
  **Anthropic** released details on Claude 3.5 SWEBench+SWEAgent, while
  **OpenAI** introduced SimpleQA and **DeepMind** launched NotebookLM. **Apple**
  announced new M4 Macbooks, and a new SOTA image model, Recraft v3, emerged.
  Hamel Husain presented a detailed 6,000-word treatise on creating LLM judges
  using a method called **critique shadowing** to align LLMs with domain
  experts, addressing the problem of untrusted and unused data in AI teams. The
  workflow involves expert-reviewed datasets and iterative prompt refinement.
  Additionally, **Zep** introduced a temporal knowledge graph memory layer to
  improve AI agent memory and reduce hallucinations. **Anthropic** also
  integrated Claude 3.5 Sonnet with GitHub Copilot, expanding access to Copilot
  Chat users.

> AI News for 10/29/2024-10/30/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **32** Discords (**231** channels, and **2558** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **241 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

On a day when [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/swe-bench-sonnet) (Claude 3.5 SWEBench+SWEAgent details), [OpenAI](https://x.com/_jasonwei/status/1851681730845118799?s=46) (SimpleQA), [DeepMind](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41995730) (NotebookLM) and [Apple](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41995701) (M4 Macbooks) and a mysterious [new SOTA image model](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1851707166744584335) (Recraft v3) have releases, it is rare to focus on news from a smaller name, but we love news you can use.

After his hit **Your AI Product Needs Evals** ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-evals-based-ai-engineering/)), Hamel Husain is back with an epic 6,000 word treatise on [Creating a LLM-as-a-Judge That Drives Business Results](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/llm-judge/), with a clear problem statement: **AI teams have too much data they don't trust and don't use.**

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/e2f7b1b6-0342-4ae1-82ed-faa407ac0c00.png?w=960&fit=max)

There are a lot of standard themes echoed in [Hamel's AI.Engineer talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLXF0VojuSs) (as well as the very fun [Weights & Biases one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIL2tE4n1Q0)), but this piece is notable for its strong recommendation of **critique shadowing** as to create few-shot examples for LLM judges to align with **domain experts**:

**Critique Shadowing TLDR**:

<ol type="1">
<li>Find Principal Domain Expert</li>
<li>Create A Dataset
<ul>
<li>Generate diverse examples covering your use cases</li>
<li>Include real or synthetic user interactions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Domain Expert Reviews Data
<ul>
<li>Expert makes pass/fail judgments</li>
<li>Expert writes detailed critiques explaining their reasoning</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fix Errors (if found)
<ul>
<li>Address any issues discovered during review</li>
<li>Return to expert review to verify fixes</li>
<li>Go back to step 3 if errors are found</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Build LLM Judge
<ul>
<li>Create prompt using expert examples</li>
<li>Test against expert judgments</li>
<li>Refine prompt until agreement is satisfactory</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Perform Error Analysis
<ul>
<li>Calculate error rates across different dimensions</li>
<li>Identify patterns and root causes</li>
<li>Fix errors and go back to step 3 if needed</li>
<li>Create specialized judges as needed</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

The final workflow looks like this:

Handy, and, as Hamel mentions in the article, this is our critique-and-domain-expert-heavy iterative process for building AINews as well!

**[Sponsored by Zep]** Why do AI agents need a memory layer, anyway? Well, including the full interaction history in prompts leads to hallucinations, poor recall, and costly LLM calls. Plus, most RAG pipelines struggle with temporal data, where facts change over time. Zep is a new service that tackles these problems using a unique structure called a **temporal knowledge graph**. [Get up and running in minutes with the quickstart](https://shortclick.link/v157af).

> swyx's commentary: [the docs for the 4 memory APIs of Zep](https://help.getzep.com/memory#understanding-zeps-different-memory-apis) also helped me better understand the scope of what Zep does/doesn't do and helped give a better mental model of what a chatbot memory API should look like agnostic of Zep. Worthwhile!

> - `kv cache implementation`
> - `dynamic cache resizing`
> - `multi-query attention`
> - `PyTorch 2.5 enhancements`

- **Revising kv Cache Creation Strategy**: Currently, the kv cache is built using **num_heads** instead of **num_kv_heads**, which may lead to unnecessary memory usage during inference. The change proposed would save memory by ensuring the kv cache is initialized with **num_kv_heads** and moved before the **expand** step.
  
  - Additionally, during inference, it's acknowledged that storing copies of enlarged tensor dimensions in kv caches is redundant and should be optimized, prompting excitement to implement these changes.
- **Dynamic Resizing for Enhanced Efficiency**: There's potential to implement a dynamic resizing feature for the kv cache, allowing for allocation under specific conditions. It would adjust memory use more efficiently by reallocating based on actual requirements rather than a predefined maximum length.
  
  - This strategy could cater to common use cases where generation continues until specific stopping criteria are met, reducing wasted space and improving performance.
- **Multi-query Attention as a Storage Solution**: The discussion pointed out that the main reasoning behind implementing **multi-query** attention is to reduce kv-cache storage. This was corroborated by a member noting that features like grouped query attention in **PyTorch 2.5** mitigate the need for manual kv expansion.
  
  - Members indicated that additional support in libraries such as **flex_attention** parallels the advancements in PyTorch, enhancing operational efficiency.
- **Concerns Regarding Compatibility with PyTorch Versions**: A concern was raised about using **enable_gqa** only being available in **PyTorch 2.5** or later, as maintaining logical consistency across different versions could complicate code management. The approach in **attention_utils.py** was outlined to ensure that logic remains consistent regardless of any specific **attention** implementations.
  
  - Members expressed a desire to simplify version management to maintain clarity in code, emphasizing a need for a pragmatic approach in future implementations.
- **Collaboration on Code Contributions**: A member expressed enthusiasm about contributing to the implementation and reiterated their willingness to send a pull request soon. Others encouraged collaboration, recognizing the shared excitement around enhancing functionalities in the project.

- **Questioning DSPy's Need for Structure Enforcement**: A member questioned the necessity of DSPy enforcing structure/types when libraries like Outlines exist for such purposes, especially with API LMs introducing structured generation.
  
  - *Isn't it better to leverage those existing libraries?*
- **Importance of Structure in DSPy**: Another member clarified that DSPy has enforced structure since v0.1 to learn the mapping from signatures to effective prompts and weights, adapting to provider capabilities.
  
  - They emphasized that while structured outputs can serve as backends, DSPy's approach balances adhering to formats with maintaining quality.
- **Discussion on Quality vs Structure in Outputs**: A member expressed skepticism about the notion that adhering to certain formats might lower quality, arguing that structured outputs could benefit from set constraints and correct grammar usage.
  
  - *This approach could yield great results, particularly for smaller LMs.*
- **Integrating MIPROv2 with DSPy**: Another member shared their experience using zero-shot MIPROv2 and a Pydantic-first interface for structured outputs, relying on the current MIPROv2 step for construction.

> - `Image Decoding Issues`

- **Clamping Issue in Image Decoding**: A member pointed out that failing to **clamp values** to [0,1] before converting decoded images to uint8 can cause **out-of-range values to wrap**.
  
  - This can lead to unexpected results in image quality and appearance.
- **Concerns Raised about Decoding Workflow**: Another participant suggested that there may be additional flaws in the **decoding workflow**, potentially affecting the overall image processing.
  
  - Further discussion is needed to pinpoint these issues and improve robustness.
