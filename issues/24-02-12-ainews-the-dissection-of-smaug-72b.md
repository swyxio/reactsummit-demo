It's now the Chinese year of the Dragon, and Abacus AI appropriately rung it in [making a lot of noise](https://twitter.com/bindureddy/status/1754665925834690907) about Smaug 72B, their latest and largest finetune of Qwen (1.0... badly timed since 1.5 just came up, but you can be sure they will update it with more noise)

Typical skepticism aside, it is still standing unchallenged after a week on [the HF Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard), and with [published contamination results](https://huggingface.co/abacusai/Smaug-72B-v0.1#contamination-results), which is a good sign. However the Nous people are skeptical:

- **Verifying on Discord Can Be Tricky**: User `@d3113` faced an error when trying to authenticate with a bot on Discord, which was resolved by enabling "Allow messages from server members" in their settings. User `@lunarflu` advised this solution and mentioned that the token used for verification can be deleted afterwards.
- **Keeping It Conversational**: User `@miker1662` was encountering issues with finding conversational models on Hugging Face due to an API bug, which `@osanseviero` confirmed and linked to an ongoing issue and changes in API usage. Hugging Face is deprecating `conversational` and merging it into `text-generation`.
- **The Dilemma of PEFT for LLM Fine-Tuning**: User `@samuelcorsan` debated whether to use PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) when fine-tuning a conversational chatbot LLM, but eventually decided to go for full fine-tuning, removing PEFT from their code. They were given advice by `@vipitis` to use the full sequence length during fine-tuning to avoid the model learning positional embeddings, chunking the dataset for efficiency.
- **Raspberry Pi for CV on the Edge**: User `@akvnn` inquired whether a Raspberry Pi could handle running a computer vision (CV) model continuously for a multi-camera system. And user `@yamatovergil89` confirmed its viability but did not specify if it could handle multiple cameras simultaneously.
- **Hardware Queries for Running LLMs Locally**: `@lookingforspeed` sought advice on whether dual NVIDIA 4080 Supers would be more suitable than a single 4090 for locally coding LLMs like Mixtral. `@tddammo` recommended older generation pro cards like the A4500 or A4000 for better electrical efficiency and support for NVLink, and subsequently explained the benefits over consumer cards.
