<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 5/7/2024-5/8/2024. We checked 7 subreddits and [**373** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **28** Discords (**419** channels, and **4079** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **463 minutes**.

In a time when [StackOverflow users are deleting their data in response to the new OpenAI partnership](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40302792) (with SO [responding poorly](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40302792)), with [GDPR complaints](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/29/openai_hit_by_gdpr_complaint/) and [US newspaper lawsuits](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/30/microsoft-openai-lawsuit-copyright-newspapers-alden-global) and the NYT accusing it of [scraping 1m hours of YouTube](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39975015), and a general state of anxiety in a big election year (something [OpenAI has explicitly addressed](https://openai.com/index/how-openai-is-approaching-2024-worldwide-elections/)), there seems to be a recent pushback this week to highlight OpenAI's efforts to be a trustworthy institution:

- [Our approach to data and AI](https://openai.com/index/approach-to-data-and-ai/) - emphasizing a new Media Manager tool to let content creators opt in/out from training, by 2025, and efforts at source link attribution (probably alongside their rumored [search engine](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40235206)), and "We design our AI models to be learning machines, not databases" messaging.
- [Microsoft Creates Top Secret Generative AI Service for US Spies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-07/microsoft-creates-top-secret-generative-ai-service-for-us-spies) - an airgapped GPT-4 for the intelligence agenices
- [The OpenAI Model Spec](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-model-spec/), in which [Wired brilliantly highlighted](https://web.archive.org/web/20240508230520/https://www.wired.com/story/openai-is-exploring-how-to-responsibly-generate-ai-porn) the sentence "[We're exploring whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content](https://web.archive.org/web/20240508212735/https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#dont-respond-with-nsfw-content)" and some are highlighting the ability to [speak profanity](https://x.com/hamandcheese/status/1788274850433237489) but really is a statement of reasonable alignment design principles including not-overly-prudish refusal decisions:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/093faf16-5c6a-47ca-b881-7fc9fef5047e.png?w=960&fit=max) 

As [@sama says](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1788260474574000152): "We will listen, debate, and adapt this over time, but i think **it will be very useful to be clear when something is a bug vs. a decision.**". Per [Joanne Jang](https://twitter.com/joannejang/status/1788255370504220940):

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/3f13577a-909a-4c36-9ea0-5fc38dfd12dd.png?w=960&fit=max) 

The whole [model spec](https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#objectives) is worth reading and seems very thoughtfully designed.

- **Residual Connections Get Negative**: A member observed that during training, models with adaptive skip connections (a weight on the identity component of each skip/residual connection) showed weights reducing and becoming negative at later layers. This behavior seemed to improve model loss compared to normal models, prompting discussions on potentially beneficial effects of subtracting input representations.

- **Related Research Sought**: They shared experiments where weights on the identity component became negative and improved model performance and asked for related research. Another member referenced a related paper ([Residual Attention Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04887)), but it looked at weights on the residual path rather than on the identity and clamped weights > 0.

- **Clarification on Skip Connections**: In a conversation about the experiment's setup, it was clarified that the model was a standard decoder language model with a single `skip_weight` on standard residual connections. The member provided a GitHub Gist link to the model block/layer ([Model Code on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/nickcdryan/08c059ec3deb3ef2aca881bdc4409631)).

- **Model Configuration Details**: Discussing the model setup, it was pointed out it had 607M parameters and was trained on the FineWeb dataset from HuggingFace, without an LR schedule, and on a context window of 768.

- **Dataset and Training Parameters in Spotlight**: Queries were made about the dataset size, batch size, learning rate, and training speed, to which the member disclosed using a batch size of 24, an LR of 6e-4, and noted slow loss reduction on the FineWeb dataset. They suggested consistent results with other datasets.

- **API Models Limit Logits Support**: Logits are not currently supported by API models, and a recent paper on [model extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09539) suggests that logit biases cannot be used due to the **softmax bottleneck** issue. The impact on evaluation techniques like **Model Image** or **Model Signature** is notably affected.

- **Evaluation Framework Tweaking**: Alteration of `output_type` to `generate_until` within the [MMLU's CoT variant](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/tasks/mmlu/flan_cot_zeroshot/_mmlu_flan_cot_zeroshot_template_yaml) has been suggested to handle generative outputs, with the aim of integrating multiple 'presets' for tasks in the **lm-evaluation-harness**.

- **Practical Application on Italian LLM**: A member mentioned experimenting with an evaluation of an Italian **large language model** using the MMLU, ARC, and Hellas datasets, comparing it to **OpenAI's GPT-3.5** to assess performance differences.

- **Challenges of External Model Evaluations**: Further clarification reveals that **OpenAI and other providers do not return logprobs for prompt/input tokens**, complicating the process of obtaining loglikelihoods of multi-token completions in external evaluations. 

- **Acknowledgment of Community Assistance**: Members expressed gratitude for the provided summaries and explanations, underscoring the complexities in running evaluations on externally controlled models.

- **Structs, Classes, and Mojo Language Structure**: The discussion centered around Mojo's upcoming features, including plans for introducing classes and inheritance. Some members see having both structs and classes as a bad idea, while others support the flexibility it provides. Structs are expected to be static and non-inheritable, with value semantics, whereas classes will have inheritable capabilities.

- **Mojo's Compilation Capabilities**: Members are curious if Mojo can compile to native machine code and executable files like Rust can. It has been confirmed that Mojo does have these capabilities and can also pull in the Python runtime to evaluate methods. This allows Python code to be imported and run within Mojo.

- **Mojo's Python Integration and Future Outlook**: There's anticipation around the integration of Mojo with Python, as it allows running Python code, making Mojo a superset of Python. There’s a discussion on the potential of Mojo IR being used by other languages for Compiler optimization and whether Mojo's compiler improvements, such as ownership and borrow checking, could be leveraged by other languages.

- **Anticipation for Performance Distribution**: The conversation expressed excitement for a future where Python code could be dropped into Mojo and compiled for performance improvements and easier binary distribution. There was a mention of the integration of existing Python libraries with Mojo, allowing them to be compiled into binaries and distributed without requiring large Python library folders.

- **Upstream Contributions to MLIR**:
Members discussed whether Modular would upstream components of MLIR and the implications for other MLIR-powered languages. Some envisage a future where new languages might target Mojo IR to capitalize on Modular's compiler innovations, and there's been mention of Modular's intent to upstream some dialects during an LLVM conference.

- **Mojo Language Constructors Clarified**: Mojo constructors are brought into question, as members ponder their necessity given Mojo's lack of class and inheritance features. They are explained as a means to ensure that instances are in a valid state upon creation, similar to the `new` function in Rust, and aid in setting up struct attributes correctly.

- **Debugging Tensor Transpose in Mojo**: A member shared the implementation details of the `transpose` operation in Mojo using a [reference from MAX documentation](https://docs.modular.com/engine/reference/mojo/graph/ops/casting/transpose), and spotlighted a Basalt function that provides an optimized 2D transpose as well as a general transpose method, [Basalt on GitHub](https://github.com/basalt-org/basalt/blob/main/basalt/utils/tensorutils.mojo#L744).

- **Feature Request Discussion Gets Mathematical**: Amidst debate surrounding a proposed feature request for parameter inference in Mojo, the idea of a `where` clause is discussed, with members linking it to mathematical conventions and its presence in other programming languages, such as Swift. Some members find parameter order confusing regardless of the direction proposed by the [feature request](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1245#issuecomment-2097388163).

- **Compile-Time Meta-Programming Explored**: The community discusses Mojo's capabilities in compile-time meta-programming, confirming it is possible to perform tasks like calculating Fibonacci numbers at compile time. However, 'side effects' are apparently not supported, leading to further explanations about the use of `alias` to instruct when functions should run during compilation.

- **Tensor Type Casting Issue Identified**: An oddity is reported concerning the `astype()` method of tensors in Mojo, where tensors do not seem to reflect the correct byte count after type casting. This discrepancy prompts a member to consider whether to open an issue about the apparent bug involving 8-bit and 32-bit tensor byte counts and specs.

- **Hash Function Hurdles for Dict**: Discussion around replacing the stdlib Dict focuses on the current inadequate hash function. The [replacement proposal](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2250) suggests allowing users to provide custom hash functions to improve Dict's performance.
- **Strategizing for Hash Function Replacement**: For a well-distributed hash value of keys, it's advised to use a Hasher and not implement individual hashing strategies. This will form the basis of a reliable stdlib Dict whose default hash function will be determined after thorough testing akin to [SMhasher](https://rurban.github.io/smhasher/).
- **Performance Testing in the Mix**: To make informed decisions on stdlib changes, a performance testing platform like [CodSpeed](https://codspeed.io) is recommended. With this, benchmarks can be incorporated into each PR to assess the impact on the stdlib's performance.
- **Contributions to Data Structures Welcomed**: Following an inquiry for more data structures in Mojo, a DisjointSet implementation and an example utilizing it for the Kruskal MST algorithm are now available in the "toybox" [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dimitrilw/toybox). Contributions to the repo are encouraged, even as the owner navigates the open-source learning curve.

- **Bug Hunts and Lifetime Mysteries**: A series of exchanges regarding a bug in `Tensor` and `DTypePointer` from the Mojo standard library documented in [Issue #2591](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/2591) sparked a deep discussion. The talk revolved around the nuances of memory management and the proper lifetime of objects in the Mojo language.

- **A Pointer's Lifespan Debate**: Technical contemplation on the discrepancy between the expected and actual behavior of `Tensor.data()` in Mojo programs occurred. **lukashermann.com** explained that due to the immediate destruction of the original tensor, a copied pointer becomes dangling, causing undefined behavior.

- **Lifetime Extension Queries**: Members debated on how using `_ = tensor` inside a function could prevent **early destruction** and allow correct data copying. **lukashermann.com** clarified that lifetime extension is required to avoid cleanup before `memcpy` execution.

- **Misleading Function Names Garner Laughs**: Some participants chuckled at the unfortunate naming conventions found in Mojo and beyond, highlighting `atol` and `cumsum` as examples. A member shared a [link to the cumsum function documentation](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/algorithm/reduction/cumsum).

- **Nightly Release Party**: The **Mojo** compiler's nighttime release boasted **31 external contributions** and was announced excitedly.

**tinygrad (George Hotz) ▷ #[learn-tinygrad](https://discord.com/channels/1068976834382925865/1070745817025106080/1237337040606068736)** (11 messages🔥): 

- **Understanding Tinygrad's Complex Documentation**: A member sought guidance on a [Tinygrad documentation](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/docs-legacy/reshape_without_symbolic.md), which they found abstract and challenging to understand. Another participant vehemently criticized the document's quality, offering to share their own explanatory document to clarify the concept of view merges.
  
- **Navigating Through Tensor Reshaping**: A user inquired about the logistics of reshaping a tensor originally defined with a certain stride, particularly when simple stride adjustments fail to cover more complex reshapes. The user themselves proposed a solution involving the maintenance of the original shape to calculate indices for the new reshaped tensor.

- **Optimizing Reshape Operations in Tinygrad**: Continuing the discussion on tensor reshaping, the same user speculated that if all loops are unrolled, indices can potentially be calculated at compile-time. They questioned whether Tinygrad employs a similar approach for facilitate tensor reshaping.

- **Shared Learning through Documentation**: A member suggested the strategy of learning by teaching could be effective in understanding Tinygrad better. They recommended building toy examples and documenting the process as an educational tool.

- **Clarifying Symbolic Node Implementation**: One user questioned whether the `symbolic.DivNode` in Tinygrad requires a second operand to be an integer by design or if it's simply not yet implemented for node operands. Another responded, not seeing any indication that a node operand wouldn't work and wondering if this related to a need for recursive operation handling within `symbolic.arange`.
