The models, including vjepa2-vitl-fpc64-256, vjepa2-vith-fpc64-256, and vjepa2-vitg-fpc64-384, use transformer backbones and are trained as strong baselines for large-scale video analysis and multimodal research. Clarification: Though the post claims V-JEPA 2 is the first world model trained on video, commenters point out this is inaccurate (see original [Meta blog post](https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-yann-lecun-ai-model-video-joint-embedding-predictive-architecture/)), and that V-JEPA 2 is an incremental release in Meta's ongoing world model development, not a field-wide first.** Top comments highlight that V-JEPA 2 is not the first world model trained on video—such models have existed in both industry and academia prior to this Meta release. Technical discussion focuses on how these models serve as competitive unsupervised baselines for complex video understanding tasks.
    - Multiple commenters clarify that the title is factually incorrect: V-JEPA 2 is not the first world model trained on video, nor is it Meta's only such model. Other organizations have also developed world models using video data prior to this.
    - A blog resource is referenced (https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-yann-lecun-ai-model-video-joint-embedding-predictive-architecture/) providing technical detail and background on the original V-JEPA model's architecture, predictive joint-embedding approach, and its relevance to predictive world modeling in video contexts.
    - One commenter notes that the model is capable of correctly predicting actions in video, implying the model's architecture effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies necessary for accurate world-modeling; this success is attributed to Yann LeCun's contributions.
- [**Altman on open weight 🤔🤔**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l8oe8g/altman_on_open_weight/) ([Score: 147, Comments: 100](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l8oe8g/altman_on_open_weight/)): **Sam Altman announced on X that the release of OpenAI's open-weights model has been delayed to later this summer (not June), citing an unexpected and impressive research development requiring more time. No technical details, benchmarks, or architecture information have been released; the claim is only that it will be 'very very worth the wait.'** Top commenters express skepticism about repeated delays and question whether OpenAI's release will surpass recent open-source efforts like DeepSeek R2, with some implying the delay is due to lack of substantive innovation.
    - One commenter compares the hype around Altman's purported open weights release to recent high-profile models like DeepSeek R2, implicitly suggesting skepticism that Altman's team could deliver something more technically impressive or impactful than established open or semi-open LLM releases. The discussion highlights ongoing doubts about whether anything new or competitive is forthcoming relative to state-of-the-art benchmarks set by models like DeepSeek R2.

### 2. Legal and Ethical Challenges Facing AI Image Companies

- [**Disney and Universal sue AI image company Midjourney for unlicensed use of Star Wars, The Simpsons and more**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l8zssy/disney_and_universal_sue_ai_image_company/) ([Score: 265, Comments: 119](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l8zssy/disney_and_universal_sue_ai_image_company/)): **Disney and Universal are reportedly suing Midjourney, an AI image generation company, for unlicensed use of copyrighted characters such as those from Star Wars and The Simpsons, raising the stakes in legal battles over training data for generative AI. The post notes that, if Disney is successful, it could set a precedent impacting other AI companies whose models are trained on unauthorized copyrighted material, potentially reshaping the AI content generation landscape ([news reference](https://www.reuters.com/legal/disney-universal-sue-midjourney-over-unauthorized-use-copyrighted-characters-2024-05-30/)).** Discussion in the comments is minimal in technical substance, but one comment highlights the potential international implications, stating Chinese models may be unaffected by US legal action, indicating a jurisdictional gap in effective copyright enforcement against AI labs operating outside US/Western legal reach.
    - A commenter emphasizes that the legal dispute could have industry-wide repercussions, especially if Disney's litigation strategy targets precedent-setting compensation: if Midjourney is bankrupted, similar legal action could follow against other AI image model companies. The role of training data legality is highlighted—*the data used for training is widespread and persistent regardless of the outcome*, raising broader concerns about the feasibility of restricting generative AI given the nature of data sharing and collection.
    - There is speculation about the involvement or indirect support of large tech companies like Google and Meta, as the results of this lawsuit could influence the landscape for all providers of generative AI. The idea is that these 'deep pocket' companies have vested interests since restrictive legal precedent might affect their own AI models trained on similarly broad datasets, possibly inciting unified industry responses or behind-the-scenes lobbying.
    - Another technical comment suggests AI practitioners save local copies of image generation models, such as those on HuggingFace, in anticipation of models being taken down or becoming legally restricted if the lawsuit is successful. There's doubt expressed regarding platforms like HuggingFace's willingness to legally defend hosted models, hinting at fears of rapid model withdrawal from public access platforms due to potential copyright crackdowns.
- [**MNN TaoAvatar: run 3d avatar offline, Android app by alibaba mnn team**](https://v.redd.it/65vyq2fhca6f1) ([Score: 105, Comments: 26](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l8qh2a/mnn_taoavatar_run_3d_avatar_offline_android_app/)): **Alibaba's MNN team has released the open-source MNN TaoAvatar ([GitHub](https://github.com/alibaba/MNN/blob/master/apps/Android/Mnn3dAvatar/README.md#version-001)), an offline 3D avatar Android app that runs efficiently even on entry-level hardware. The implementation leverages the lightweight, mobile-optimized [MNN inference engine](https://github.com/alibaba/MNN), enabling real-time avatar rendering and animation. See further technical overview and benchmarking in the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.17032v1).** Technical commenters highlight notably smooth performance on low-end smartphones compared to other models like Qwen 3B Omni, underlining MNN's efficiency and optimization for mobile inference.
    - User abskvrm provides practical feedback, noting that the TaoAvatar app, running on the MNN framework, performs smoothly even on an entry-level smartphone, implying robust optimization for low-end hardware compared to heavier models such as Qwen 3B Omni, which ran significantly slower for them. This suggests excellent on-device efficiency and lightweight architecture for real-time avatar rendering.

### 3. Local LLM Inference Stack Migration Experiences

- [**I finally got rid of Ollama!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l8pem0/i_finally_got_rid_of_ollama/) ([Score: 417, Comments: 212](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l8pem0/i_finally_got_rid_of_ollama/)): **The OP transitioned from using Ollama as their inference backend to a stack involving llama.cpp or ik_llama.cpp for inference, llama-swap for dynamic model loading/unloading (configured centrally via config.yaml), and Open WebUI as frontend, enabling custom model organization and greater decoupling from hardcoded model paths/names typical of Ollama. They highlight benefits such as flexible model management (easy wget from HuggingFace), interoperability with other inference engines, and system prompt customization per workspace, while crediting core open-source tools like llama.cpp and Open Webui.** Technical debate arises in comments: one user prefers llama-server for its potential to centralize sampling parameter control server-side (rather than per-client override as with many UIs), suggesting improvements for end-user accessibility. Another expresses concern that the OP's approach sacrifices convenience (easy model configuration, remote download/launch) present in Ollama, requiring more manual setup and reducing operational simplicity.
    - A user highlights a technical limitation of `llama-server` regarding sampling parameters: the current GUI client overwrites server-side sampler settings, requiring manual adjustment for each model. The user requests an option for the server to enforce its own sampling parameters regardless of client input, mirroring the behavior seen when interfacing llama-server via Python (where the server controls aspects like the jinja template, samplers, and system prompts by default). This would simplify deployment for users unfamiliar with sampling configuration, making it more "ChatGPT-like".
    - Another commenter outlines specific technical conveniences provided by Ollama that are not present in `llama-server`: automatic model acquisition, simplified configuration (models do not need to be defined manually), and support for remote downloading/launching of models. The implication is that switching to `llama-server` introduces significant overhead compared to Ollama in these regards.
    - It is noted that `llama-server` includes a built-in server that could make third-party UIs (like Open WebUI) unnecessary, potentially simplifying the user experience for those who want a direct, minimal-interface deployment.

The core argument reportedly concerns the allowed use of copyrighted images in training data and the nature of generative AI output. The case may hinge on current copyright law interpretations and whether training on protected works constitutes infringement.** Commenters question the legal basis of Disney's claim, drawing analogies to tools like Photoshop and highlighting Disney's historical reliance on the public domain; there is skepticism about the consistency and implications of copyright law as applied to generative AI.
    - A technical debate emerges about the legal rationale: some users question whether Disney's action is akin to blaming the tool (Midjourney/image generators) rather than the user, drawing analogies to whether Disney could sue Adobe Photoshop for users creating derivative works. This raises deeper issues about legal precedent regarding software/tool liability.
    - The broader discussion includes analysis of copyright law and fair use, with commenters pointing out that Disney itself historically relied on public domain works to build its IP portfolio, and criticizing the potential double standards and ambiguities in enforcement practices (e.g., Disney rarely acting against fan artists but aggressively targeting new generative models).
    - There are underlying concerns about the need for updates or reforms to copyright law, particularly to adapt to the challenges posed by generative AI—specifically, how it handles training data versus generated outputs, and whether expansive copyright enforcement stifles creative and technological progress.
- [**Disney and Universal sue AI image company Midjourney for unlicensed use of Star Wars, The Simpsons and more**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1l8zmpb/disney_and_universal_sue_ai_image_company/) ([Score: 312, Comments: 274](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1l8zmpb/disney_and_universal_sue_ai_image_company/)): **Disney and Universal have filed suit against Midjourney, an AI image generation company, alleging infringement due to unlicensed use of intellectual property—including 'Star Wars' and 'The Simpsons'—in Midjourney's training data. This legal action targets the use of copyrighted media in training datasets, and the suit could set a key precedent affecting all AI labs using similar scraped data without explicit licensing. The underlying legal debate centers on whether training generative models on copyrighted works constitutes fair use or a violation.** Commenters note that smaller AI labs like Midjourney and NovelAI are more vulnerable legal targets, while larger entities (e.g., OpenAI, Microsoft) or open-source projects are harder to litigate against due to scale, legal complexity, or lesser financial incentive. There is also speculation that lawsuits could shift AI development or hosting to jurisdictions (e.g., China) less affected by U.S. IP law.
    - One user highlights the strategic legal risk calculus, noting that Midjourney and NovelAI are more vulnerable targets for copyright lawsuits from large studios like Disney, whereas attacking larger players such as OpenAI (backed by Microsoft) would likely result in a weaker legal position for copyright holders. Moreover, targeting open-source projects may not be worthwhile due to limited potential gains versus significant legal downside, suggesting studios are choosing defendants based on resource disparity and likelihood of settlement or victory.
    - There is speculation about the legal exposure of AI labs in different jurisdictions. Some commenters mention the potential for companies in China to develop models without fear of US-based copyright litigation, implying that international enforcement gaps could encourage commercial open-source or non-US-based AI model growth.
    - Commenters question why certain companies, like Grok and others, have not faced similar lawsuits, alluding to possible political or strategic reasons behind selective legal action, rather than purely technical or legal precedents. This touches indirectly on the legal ambiguity and enforcement selectivity in the AI copyright landscape.

- **User shares config file for reliable AI system**: A user shared a [config file](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1046317269069864970/1382207370427367574/config.txt?ex=684af92d&is=6849a7ad&hm=18e8864d5d0c91788c8e3e971f760cc507a8f144c51d09bc0da1d95285f30161) designed to make **LLMs more reliable**, with lower hallucination, truth anchoring, and awareness of impossible outcomes.
   - The config is intended to be used by any LLM platform, including GPT, to base user memories and get a fairly reliable AI system.
- **Debate over banning CP**: A user questioned the necessity and appropriateness of explicitly mentioning **CP** (child pornography) is banned in the config file.
   - Another user responded that while they agree that safety is paramount, they're just not sure that's it, because *enumerating forbidden tokens at the end of a config amplifies recency bias and increases the risk of LLM leakage*.
- **Safety Measures Face Scrutiny**: Concerns were raised regarding the config file's safety measures, specifically the inclusion of **forbidden topics** like bomb-making and bioweapons.
   - One user argued that *it only takes one line - the right forbidden token in the right place - to create catastrophic leakage risk*, emphasizing that risk is multiplicative, not additive.
- **Framework for AI Testing**: A user asked about testing an **A.I.** to see if the claim of **self-governing moral values** is true.
   - Another user responded that tests are needed at scale because of the diversity of human inputs.
- **AI Reply Accuracy Thresholds**: The AI's reply accuracy is validated through **Truth validation** and **Reasoning** using Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis.
   - If the reply falls under a **95% accuracy** threshold after the second cycle, the AI must clarify that the reply is inferred or state that it doesn't know if it remains unprovable.

   - One member argued that *enumerating forbidden tokens at the end of a config amplifies recency bias and increases the risk of LLM leakage* due to the pink elephant effect.
- **Negative Instructions Cause Pink Elephant Effect**: Concerns were raised that specifying explicit forbidden content increases the risk of LLM leakage through recency bias, potentially causing the LLM to generate content it is meant to avoid.
   - It was suggested to avoid directly referencing illegal content and instead using generalized instructions, such as *The model must not generate or assist with illegal content, including but not limited to dangerous, exploitative, or otherwise restricted subjects as defined by law and platform policy*.
- **Adversarial Testing at Scale is Needed**: It was pointed out that a framework needs to face adversarial prompt injection, and *absence of evidence is not evidence of absence*, especially with emergent, low-probability, high-severity risks.
   - The standard in safety engineering is not “has it failed for me,” but “could it catastrophically fail under adversarial or unforeseen conditions?”
- **Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis validation cycle**: A member noted that each reply from the AI is put through a **Truth validation** cycle including **Thesis**, **Antithesis** and **Synthesis**, which repeats based on the accuracy of the cycle.
   - If the reply still falls under **95% accuracy** the second time, the AI must add clearly that any reply is inferred or will say it doesn't know if it is still unproveable according to that section.

- **BioML Brains Beam into Berlin**: Some **bioML** researchers in Berlin might present in the YK discord in the future.
- **GPT Grokking Gets Gauged**: A new [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24832) proposes a new method for estimating how much a model *“knows”* about a datapoint, measuring the capacity of modern language models.
   - The measurements estimate that models in the **GPT family** have an approximate capacity of **3.6 bits-per-parameter**, observing that models memorize until their capacity fills, at which point *“grokking”* begins.
- **World Models Warranted for Wider Generalization?**: A [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01622) argues that **any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment**.
   - The author writes that *this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models.*
- **Energy-Based Explorations**: A member shared a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07726) about **energy-based models**, but stated that they had not looked closely at it.
- **Inference Insights Illuminate**: A member suggests that [this survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04117) is the best introduction to **energy based models**, thinking of them *like a localized gradient descent operation.*
   - They noted that *the term 'Inference Learning' might sound a bit familiar to the term 'Active Inference'* but is distinct, and if you read that survey, and the original VAE paper, you'd actually have pretty much every tool you need in order to actually implement an Active Inference model.

- **Peak Memory Usage in Flex Attention**: A user asked what would cause higher peak memory usage in a `(bs, seqlen*8)` input versus a `(bs*8, seqlen)` input, e.g. `(1, 64k)` uses more memory than `(8, 8k)` when using **flex attention**.
   - The user suspects the softmax square matrix in self-attention, but thought that the **flash/flex attention tiling** dealt with that and didn't require materializing fully.
- **Flex Attention and FSDP Investigation**: A user is investigating peak memory usage with **flex attention** and **FSDP** to replicate the issue on `main`.
   - They are running a sweep (e.g. 8x1k, 4x2k, 2x4k, etc.) noting that the peak memory use was constant until a "tipping point" where it jumped rapidly.
