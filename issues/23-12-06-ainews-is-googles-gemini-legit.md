<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->Hi alpha testers!

That's right, there's now a custom intro for these newsletters. We're very flattered that hundreds of you have somehow found this crappy MVP and so I decided to put in a little last-mile human touch commentary. 

The big news of the day is of course Google Gemini. Multiple discords talking about it - the marketing is great, but people are rightly skeptical. Chief among them is that the central MMLU claim is based on 32-shot chain of thought: ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1974364b-279d-49d2-b9ef-304fb9c2d5ae.png?w=960&fit=max) 


We will know more on Dec 13th.

in other news:

- our bot now attempts to read links dropped by users. So for example, if you see the Latent Space Paper Club, we drop in arxiv links, and the summarizer knows the title and abstract of those papers. same for twitter/youtube/hn etc.
- discord links now head straight to the first message captured, thanks to Sam Ching for feedback.

til tomorrow,

He offered the service for free to a few interested individuals.
- **DIY Assistant GPT**: `@appstormer_25583` shared a [link](https://beta.appstorm.ai/share?url=18c2600b) to a **DIY assistant GPT** that can analyze home repair images and provide tips.
- **Lang chain and llm**: `@m1337d` shared a [tweet](https://twitter.com/introsp3ctor/status/1732417785454850060?t=h1XGyGeiCTMbR-6DK3uMRg&s=19) indicating that Lang chain can now be embedded into the llm (Llama). This allows the Lang chain code to run directly inside as a callback to the llm.
- **New Version of Hypertion**: `@synacktra` announced a new version of Hypertion with Pydantic model support. He shared the links to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/synacktraa/hypertion) and the [Pypi project](https://pypi.org/project/hypertion). Hypertion is a Python library for streamlined and efficient LLM function calling.

- **Production Ops for LLMs**: `@red_shoes_3` enquired about best practices for logging and using production to evaluate, specifically in the context of chatbots, code search, etc. They seek insight on how to collect production data that can later be used as training data in different application scenarios.
- **Deep Learning and Planning**: `@lightningralf` shared a [Tweet from Jürgen Schmidhuber](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI/status/1732430359969571014?t=TjxdpzJfRxhUfDwQJZUC4A&s=19), where Schmidhuber presents his contributions to deep learning architectures capable of planning in response to claims from Yann LeCun. Schmidhuber cites numerous publications of his work dating back to 1990 and concludes with the hope that he will someday provide a model of his own.

- **Introduction and Community Engagement**: User `@ajink024` introduced themselves as Asante and mentioned their participation in the **Open Source Meetup AI Data Source**.
- **AI Applications Production Meetup Plug**: `@kainan_e` encouraged others to attend a meetup currently being held at 180 Townsend, covering the process of taking AI applications from experiment to large-scale production. The meetup was set to feature a walk-through of a reference architecture aimed at simplifying this process. Detailed information was shared with [this link](https://www.pinecone.io/community/events/pinecone-meetup-sf-taking-ai-apps-to-production/).
- **Late Registration**: `@kainan_e` mentioned that late registration can still be accommodated at the door.

- **Performance Benchmarks with lm-eval harness 4.0**: User `@nanobitz` sought input after noting lower-than-expected [ARC](https://github.com/openai/lm-eval) scores using the new 4.0 release of lm-eval harness. The results seemed especially lower compared to the ones on HF OpenLLM leaderboard with the 7b chat.
- **Concerns over Winogrande + GSM8k Leaderboard Results**: `@nanobitz` also posted a query about the leaderboard results for **Winogrande + GSM8k** which seemed off.
- **Interfacing Torch.jit with Flash Attention**: `@imonenext` shared a problem they encountered when trying to use Torch.jit with Flash Attention, leading to this [issue](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/issues/701) regarding the incompatibility of `max_seqlen` type with `torch.jit.trace`.
- **Flash Attention 2** Performance with PyTorch SDPA: `@benjamin_w` mentioned that Flash Attention 2 has some limitations when interfaced with PyTorch's SDPA implementation, leading to minor performance losses due to graph breaks on every external CUDA call. Despite this, they shared a link to a [blog post](https://benjaminwarner.dev/2023/08/16/flash-attention-compile) (link broken) discussing scenarios where Flash Attention 2 outperforms PyTorch's SDPA implementation.
- **LayerNorm Speed Improvement with Torch.jit**: `@imonenext` gave the input that using jit with LayerNorm can boost performance by up to 5%.

- **Discussion on AWS Aurora Limitless**: User `@rafaelnadal` brought up a discussion about **AWS Aurora Limitless**, AWS's new competitor to Yugabyte/Cockroach. The user wondered why AWS launched its product later than its competitors (Yugabyte and Cockroach started in 2015/2016) and if this indicates a large market for distributed/Active-Active, ACID databases.
