description: >-
  **18 guilds**, **277 channels**, and **1342 messages** were analyzed with an
  estimated reading time saved of **187 minutes**. The community switched to
  **GPT-4 turbo** and discussed the rise of **Mixture of Experts (MoE) models**
  like **Mixtral**, **DeepSeekMOE**, and **Phixtral**. Model merging techniques,
  including naive linear interpolation and "frankenmerges" by **SOLAR** and
  **Goliath**, are driving new performance gains on open leaderboards.
  Discussions in the **Nous Research AI Discord** covered topics such as AI
  playgrounds supporting prompt and RAG parameters, security concerns about
  third-party cloud usage, debates on Discord bots and TOS, skepticism about
  **Teenage Engineering's** cloud LLM, and performance differences between
  **GPT-4 0613** and **GPT-4 turbo**. The community also explored fine-tuning
  strategies involving **DPO**, **LoRA**, and safetensors, integration of RAG
  with API calls, semantic differences between MoE and dense LLMs, and data
  frameworks like **llama index** and **SciPhi-AI's synthesizer**. Issues with
  anomalous characters in fine-tuning were also raised.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> We checked **18** guilds, **277** channels, and **1342** messages for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **187 minutes**. New: we also switched to GPT-4 turbo today. Let us know how it feels vs previous days (GPT-4-32k)!

A bunch of MoE models have sprung up since the Mixtral architecture has been published - [DeepSeekMOE](https://x.com/deepseek_ai/status/1745304852211839163?s=46&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww), [Phixtral](https://twitter.com/maximelabonne/status/1744867841436700850). But equally interesting is the practice of "model merging" - from naive (spherical) linear interpolation to "frankenmerges" used by SOLAR and Goliath. It seems that these techniques have created a new growth spurt in the open leaderboards as even [relatively naive implementations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38882726) are handily beating vanilla incumbents from the big labs.

Only 1 channel had activity, so no need to summarize...

- **GCP Waives Egress Fees Due to New EU Regulation**: `@stevekamman` highlighted that **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** is eliminating egress fees for data transfer to other clouds as a response to a new **EU regulation**. He expects **Azure** and **AWS** to follow suit. This change is intended to make it cheaper to switch cloud providers, although it does not simplify the complex economics of data transfer pricing. An attached diagram illustrates this complexity, but the diagram was not included in the message.

- **Examining Groq's Approach to AI Hardware**: `@stevekamman` shared links discussing **Groq**'s hardware capabilities, specifically the **LLAMA7B** model running on Groq's architecture. A general [architecture paper](https://groq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ISCA-TSP.pdf) outlines their "Superlane" concept and clocking variance. For those seeking a simpler explanation, he shared a [plain-english explainer](https://groq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GROQ-ROCKS-NEURAL-NETWORKS.pdf) on how Groq's technology innovates neural network processing, but also noted a lack of signs of adoption in practical settings.
