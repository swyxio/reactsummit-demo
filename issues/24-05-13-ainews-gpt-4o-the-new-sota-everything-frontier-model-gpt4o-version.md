Say hello to [GPT-4O](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/)!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQacCB9tDaw

It turns out that the numerous leaks about a "Her" like-chatbot announcement were most accurate, with a [surprisingly "hot"](https://x.com/andykreed/status/1790082413428629843) voice but also the ability to [respond with (an average 300ms, down from ~3000ms) low latency](https://x.com/karmedge/status/1790084650582397118?s=46&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww), [have vision](https://x.com/MikeBuckleySF/status/1790095001604730935), [handle interruptions and sing](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1790071008499544518), [speak faster or in pirate/whale](https://twitter.com/willdepue/status/1790078289023062255), and more. There's also a [waitlisted](https://t.co/CF3T8dg8oQ) new desktop app that has the ability to read from the screen and clipboard history that directly challenges the desktop agent startups like Multion/Adept.

But nobody leaked that this also comes with a new versioned model, now confirmed to be the "gpt2-chatbot" that was previewed on LMsys, that is [confirmed to be substantially](https://twitter.com/lmsysorg/status/1790097597056872603) above all other prior frontier models:

The [official blogpost](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/) has a lot more video examples demonstrating the app and model, including new versions of image output that may or may not be Dall-E or some completely new thing:

Lots of people are making noise about the 3d object demo, but we can't be sure if that's just code generation since there were hidden steps in there.

To do this, OpenAI had to beat SOTA on everything all at once, including ASR and Vision:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/5299d061-85d5-49d5-94a5-9e40319cf33a.png?w=960&fit=max)

The tiktokenizer update revealed an expanded [200k vocab size](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1790081902415851542) that makes non-English cheaper/more native.

Lots more takes are flying, but as is tradition on Frontier Model days on AINews, we're publishing two editions of AINews. **You're currently reading the one where all Part 1 and Part 2 summaries are done by GPT4O** - the next email you get is the same but with GPT4T (update: it completed [here](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-gpt-4o-the-new-sota-everything-frontier-9515/), 74% slower than GPT4O). We envision that you will pull them up side by side ([like this](https://twitter.com/main_horse/status/1790099796193398831)!) to get comparisons on discords you care about to better understand the improvements/regressions.

- **Understanding Variable Shapes in Tensors**: There was a discussion around representing tensors with variable shapes for optimization, particularly in transformers where the number of tokens can change. A user referenced a [Tinygrad Notes article](https://mesozoic-egg.github.io/tinygrad-notes/upcast2.html) and examples from Whisper code ([example 1](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/a1940ced7746fcdf09068aadf4155e4c1e3641b8/examples/whisper.py#L36-L45), [example 2](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/a1940ced7746fcdf09068aadf4155e4c1e3641b8/examples/whisper.py#L118-L120)).

- **Clarifying Tensor and Axis Terms**: A question was raised about the difference between "dim" and "axis" in operations like sum and concatenate in tensors. It was noted that they often refer to the same concept but are used in different contexts possibly due to legacy reasons.

- **Handling Missing Gradients in Training**: One user encountered an "AssertionError" related to `Tensor.training` while training a bigram model, which was resolved by setting `Tensor.training = True`. This discussion included references to relevant [GitHub code](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/pull/4460/files) and suggestions for improving error messages.

- **Aggregating Features with Tensor Operations**: Another user sought advice on implementing feature aggregation for a simple Neural Turing Machine. They discussed tensor operations, provided code examples, and explored optimization techniques, sharing [aggregate feature GitHub code](https://gist.github.com/RaulPPelaez/36b6a3a4bbdb0c373beaf3c1376e8f49).

- **Issues with Backpropagation through `where` Call**: There was a hurdle in backpropagating through a "where" call in tinygrad that worked in PyTorch, leading to a `RuntimeError` due to missing gradients. A solution was proposed involving the use of `detach().where()` to resolve the gradient assignment issue.
