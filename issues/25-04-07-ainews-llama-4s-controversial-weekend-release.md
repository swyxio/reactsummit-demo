title: Llama 4's Controversial Weekend Release
date: '2025-04-08T01:55:40.760246Z'
original_slug: ainews-llama-4s-controversial-weekend-release
description: >-
  **Meta** released **Llama 4**, featuring two new medium-size MoE open models
  and a promised 2 Trillion parameter "behemoth" model, aiming to be the largest
  open model ever. The release included advanced training techniques like
  Chameleon-like early fusion with MetaCLIP, interleaved chunked attention
  without RoPE, native FP8 training, and training on up to 40 trillion tokens.
  Despite the hype, the release faced criticism for lack of transparency
  compared to Llama 3, implementation issues, and poor performance on some
  benchmarks. Meta leadership, including **Ahmad Al Dahle**, denied allegations
  of training on test sets. The smallest Scout model at 109B parameters is too
  large for consumer GPUs, and the claimed 10 million token context is disputed.
  The community response has been mixed, with some praising the openness and
  others pointing out discrepancies and quality concerns.

> AI News for 4/4/2025-4/7/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**229** channels, and **18760** messages) for you.

The headlines of [Llama 4](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/) are glowing: 2 new medium-size MoE open models that score well, and a third 2 Trillion parameter "behemoth" promised that should be the largest open model ever released, restoring Meta's place at the top of the charts:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/4d1ed552-8287-4988-9401-68d0456e7d6b.png?w=960&fit=max)

[SOTA training updates](https://x.com/iscienceluvr/status/1908601269004230763) are always welcome: we note the adoption of [Chameleon-like](https://techxplore.com/news/2024-05-meta-chameleon-early-fusion-multimodal.html) early fusion with [MetaCLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16671), interleaved, [chunked](https://fxtwitter.com/nrehiew_/status/1908617547236208854) [attention without RoPE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19466) (commented on [by many](https://fxtwitter.com/nrehiew_/status/1908598863365013823)), [native FP8 training](https://x.com/EMostaque/status/1908960936658141546), and trained on [up to 40T tokens](https://fxtwitter.com/maximelabonne/status/1908603628828451127).

While the closed model labs tend to set the frontier, Llama usually sets the bar for what open models should be. [Llama 3 was released almost a year ago](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/), and subsequent updates like [Llama 3.2](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-llama-32-on-device-1b3b-and-multimodal/) were just as well received.

[Usual license handwringing aside](https://fxtwitter.com/maximelabonne/status/1908602756182745506), the tone of Llama 4's reception has been remarkably different.

1. Llama 4 was released on a Saturday, much earlier than seemingly even Meta, which [changed the release date last minute from Monday](https://x.com/teortaxestex/status/1908706840554197309?s=46), expected. Zuck's official line is simply that it was "ready".
2. Just the [blogpost](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/), nowhere near the level of the Llama 3 paper in transparency
3. The smallest "Scout" model is 109B params, which cannot be run on [consumer grade GPUs](https://x.com/JeffDean/status/1908608454216028222).
4. The [claimed 10m token context is almost certainly far above what the "real" context is when trained with 256k tokens](https://fxtwitter.com/burkov/status/1908658566887596475) (still impressive! but not 10m!) 
5. There was a special "experimental" version used for LMarena, which caused the good score - that is not the version that was released. This discrepancy [forced LMarena to respond by releasing the full dataset for evals](https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1909397817434816562).
6. It [does very poorly](https://fxtwitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1908976568879476843) on independent benchmarks like Aider
7. [Unsubstantiated posts on Chinese social media claim company leadership pushed for training on test](https://x.com/suchenzang/status/1909070231517143509?s=46) to meet Zuck's goals.

The last point has been [categorically denied by Meta leadership](https://x.com/Ahmad_Al_Dahle/status/1909302532306092107):
![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/4d5f7b00-fef1-4aa3-9618-8918312f5942.png?w=960&fit=max)

but the whiff that something is wrong with the release has undoubtedly tarnished what would otherwise be a happy day in Open AI land.

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama Recap

### Theme 1. "Transforming Time Series Forecasting with Neuroplasticity"

- **[Neural Graffiti - A Neuroplasticity Drop-In Layer For Transformers Models](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtlymx)** ([Score: 170, Comments: 56](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jtlymx/neural_graffiti_a_neuroplasticity_dropin_layer/)): **The post introduces **Neural Graffiti**, a neuroplasticity drop-in layer for transformer models. This layer is inserted between the transformer layer and the output projection layer, allowing the model to acquire neuroplasticity traits by changing its outputs over time based on past experiences. **Vector embeddings** from the transformer layer are mean-pooled and modified with past memories to influence token generation, gradually evolving the model's internal understanding of concepts. A demo is available on GitHub: [babycommando/neuralgraffiti](https://github.com/babycommando/neuralgraffiti).** The author finds **liquid neural networks** *"awesome"* for emulating the human brain's ability to change connections over time. They express fascination in *"hacking"* the model despite not fully understanding the transformer's neuron level. They acknowledge challenges such as the cold start problem and emphasize the importance of finding the *"sweet spot"*. They believe this approach could make the model acquire a *"personality in behavior"* over time.

  - Some users praise the idea, noting it could address issues needed for true personal assistants and likening it to self-learning, potentially allowing the LLM to *"talk what it wants"*.
  - One user raises technical considerations, suggesting that applying the graffiti layer earlier in the architecture might be more effective, as applying it after the attention and feedforward blocks may limit meaningful influence on the output.
  - Another user anticipates an ethics discussion about the potential misuse of such models.


### Theme 2. "Disappointment in Meta's Llama 4 Performance"

- **[So what happened to Llama 4, which trained on 100,000 H100 GPUs?](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jtkb3p/so_what_happened_to_llama_4_which_trained_on/)** ([Score: 256, Comments: 85](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jtkb3p/so_what_happened_to_llama_4_which_trained_on/)): **The post discusses Meta's Llama 4, which was reportedly trained using **100,000 H100 GPUs**. Despite having fewer resources, Deepseek claims to have achieved better performance with models like **DeepSeek-V3-0324**. Yann LeCun stated that **FAIR** is working on the next generation of AI architectures beyond auto-regressive LLMs.** The poster suggests that Meta's leading edge is diminishing and that smaller open-source models have been surpassed by Qwen, with _Qwen3 is coming..._.

  - One commenter questions the waste of GPUs and electricity on disappointing training results, suggesting that the GPUs could have been used for better purposes.
  - Another commenter points out that the Meta blog post mentioned using **32K GPUs** instead of 100K and provides a [link](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/) for reference.
  - A commenter criticizes Yann LeCun, stating that while he was a great scientist, he has made many mispredictions regarding LLMs and should be more humble.

- **[Meta's Llama 4 Fell Short](https://i.redd.it/rwrke16rpate1.png)** ([Score: 1791, Comments: 175](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jt7hlc/metas_llama_4_fell_short/)): **Meta's Llama 4 models, Scout and Maverick, have been released but are disappointing. Joelle Pineau, Meta’s AI research lead, has been fired. The models use a mixture-of-experts setup with a small expert size of **17B parameters**, which is considered small nowadays. Despite having extensive GPU resources and data, Meta's efforts are not yielding successful models. An image compares four llamas labeled Llama1 to Llama4, with Llama4 appearing less polished.** The poster is disappointed with Llama 4 Scout and Maverick, stating that they *'left me really disappointed'*. They suggest the underwhelming performance might be due to the tiny expert size in their mixture-of-experts setup, noting that **17B parameters** *'feels small these days'*. They believe that Meta's struggle shows that *'having all the GPUs and Data in the world doesn't mean much if the ideas aren't fresh'*. They praise companies like DeepSeek and OpenAI for showing that real innovation pushes AI forward and criticize the approach of just throwing resources at a problem without fresh ideas. They conclude that AI advancement requires not just brute force but brainpower too.

  - One commenter recalls rumors that Llama 4 was so disappointing compared to DeepSeek that Meta considered not releasing it, suggesting they should have waited to release Llama 5.
  - Another commenter criticizes Meta's management, calling it a *'dumpster fire'*, and suggests that Zuckerberg needs to refocus, comparing Meta’s situation to Google's admission of being behind and subsequent refocusing.
  - A commenter finds it strange that Meta's model is underwhelming despite having access to an absolutely *massive* amount of data from Facebook that nobody else has.

- **[I'd like to see Zuckerberg try to replace mid level engineers with Llama 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jt85zy/id_like_to_see_zuckerberg_try_to_replace_mid/)** ([Score: 381, Comments: 62](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jt85zy/id_like_to_see_zuckerberg_try_to_replace_mid/)): **The post references Mark Zuckerberg's statement that AI will soon replace mid-level engineers, as reported in a Forbes article linked [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2025/01/26/business-tech-news-zuckerberg-says-ai-will-replace-mid-level-engineers-soon/).** The author is skeptical of Zuckerberg's claim, implying that replacing mid-level engineers with **Llama 4** may not be feasible.

  - One commenter jokes that perhaps Zuckerberg replaced engineers with **Llama3**, leading to **Llama4** not turning out well.
  - Another commenter suggests that he might need to use **Gemini 2.5 Pro** instead.
  - A commenter criticizes **Llama4**, calling it *"a complete joke"* and expressing doubt that it can replace even a well-trained high school student.


### Theme 3. "Meta's AI Struggles: Controversies and Innovations"

- **[Llama 4 is open - unless you are in the EU](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jtejzj/llama_4_is_open_unless_you_are_in_the_eu/)** ([Score: 602, Comments: 242](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jtejzj/llama_4_is_open_unless_you_are_in_the_eu/)): **Llama 4 has been released by Meta with a license that bans entities domiciled in the European Union from using it. The license explicitly states: *"You may not use the Llama Materials if you are... domiciled in a country that is part of the European Union."* Additional restrictions include mandatory use of Meta's branding (**LLaMA** must be in any derivative's name), required attribution (*"Built with LLaMA"*), no field-of-use freedom, no redistribution freedom, and the model is not **OSI-compliant**, thus not considered open source.** The author argues that this move isn't "open" in any meaningful sense but is corporate-controlled access disguised in community language. They believe Meta is avoiding the EU AI Act's transparency and risk requirements by legally excluding the EU. This sets a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to a fractured, privilege-based AI landscape where access depends on an organization's location. The author suggests that real "open" models like **DeepSeek** and **Mistral** deserve more attention and questions whether others will switch models, ignore the license, or hope for change.

  - One commenter speculates that Meta is trying to avoid EU regulations on AI and doesn't mind if EU users break this term; they just don't want to be held to EU laws.
  - Another commenter notes that there's no need to worry because, according to some, Llama 4 performs poorly.
  - A commenter humorously hopes that Meta did not use EU data to train the model, implying a potential double standard.

- **[Meta’s head of AI research stepping down (before the llama4 flopped)](https://apnews.com/article/meta-ai-research-chief-stepping-down-joelle-pineau-c596df5f0d567268c4acd6f41944b5db)** ([Score: 166, Comments: 31](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jt884c/metas_head_of_ai_research_stepping_down_before/)): **Meta's head of AI research, Joelle, is stepping down. Joelle is the head of **FAIR** (Facebook AI Research), but **GenAI** is a different organization within Meta. There are discussions about **Llama4** possibly not meeting expectations. Some mention that blending in benchmark datasets in post-training may have caused issues, attributing failures to the choice of architecture (**MOE**).** The original poster speculates that Joelle's departure is an early sign of the Llama4 disaster that went unnoticed. Some commenters disagree, stating that people leave all the time and this doesn't indicate problems with Llama4. Others suggest that AI development may be slowing down, facing a plateau. There's confusion over Meta's leadership structure, with some believing Yann LeCun leads the AI organization.

  - One commenter clarifies that *Joelle is the head of FAIR* and that *GenAI is a different org*, emphasizing organizational distinctions within Meta.
  - Another mentions they *heard* from a Meta employee about issues with blending benchmark datasets in post-training and attributes possible failures to the choice of architecture (**MOE**).
  - A commenter questions Meta's structure, asking if *Joelle reports to Yann LeCun*, indicating uncertainty about who leads the AI efforts at Meta.

- **[“Serious issues in Llama 4 training. I Have Submitted My Resignation to GenAI“](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jt8yug/serious_issues_in_llama_4_training_i_have/)** ([Score: 922, Comments: 218](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jt8yug/serious_issues_in_llama_4_training_i_have/)): **An original Chinese post alleges serious issues in the training of **Llama 4**, stating that despite repeated efforts, the model underperforms compared to open-source state-of-the-art benchmarks. The author claims that company leadership suggested *blending test sets from various benchmarks during the post-training process* to artificially boost performance metrics. The author states they have submitted their resignation and requested their name be excluded from the technical report of Llama 4, mentioning that the VP of AI at Meta also resigned for similar reasons.** The author finds this approach unethical and unacceptable. Commenters express skepticism about the validity of these claims and advise others to *take the information with a grain of salt*. Some suggest that such practices reflect broader issues within the industry, while others note that similar problems can occur in academia.

  - A commenter points out that Meta's head of AI research announced departure on *Tue, Apr 1 2025*, suggesting it might be an April Fool's joke.
  - Another commenter shares a response from someone at Facebook AI who denies overfitting test sets to boost scores and requests evidence, emphasizing transparency.
  - A user highlights that company leadership suggesting blending test sets into training data amounts to *fraud* and criticizes the intimidation of employees in this context.

   - The session also covered **preemption**, **in-process restart**, **silent data corruption detection**, and **local checkpointing**, though not all features are currently implemented; the member offered to compare **torchtune** vs. **NeMo** in resiliency.
- **Debate ensues over RL Workflow**: A discussion arose regarding the complexities of **RL workflows**, data formats, and prompt templates, proposing a separation of concerns for decoupling data conversion and prompt creation.
   - The suggestion was to factorize data conversion into a standard format and then convert this format into an actual string with the prompt, to allow template reuse across datasets.
- **DeepSpeed to boost Torchtune?**: A member proposed integrating **DeepSpeed** as a backend into **torchtune** and created [an issue](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/issues/2569) to discuss its feasibility.
   - Concerns were raised about redundancy with **FSDP**, which already supports all sharding options available in **DeepSpeed**.

> `Qwen 2.5, FSDP isn't working, multi-GPU, Llama 4` 


- ****Qwen 2.5** is the latest series of **Qwen** large language models**: **Qwen2.5** models range from **0.5 to 72 billion parameters**, with improved capabilities in coding, math, instruction following, long text generation (**over 8K tokens**), and multilingual support (**29+ languages**), as detailed in the [Hugging Face introduction](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct).
   - These models offer **long-context support up to 128K tokens** and improved resilience to system prompts.
- ****FSDP** isn't working but **Multi-GPU** can save the day**: Members discussed issues with **FSDP** not working, with one member suggesting to *get your search foo up* and look for **multi-GPU** setups instead of accelerate, offering debugging assistance.
   - A user provided [their pip freeze output](https://example.com/pip-freeze-output) showing the exact versions of **unsloth** and **unsloth_zoo** being used for GRPO, after being prompted to share it.
- ****Meta** releases **Llama 4 Scout & Maverick**, 17B active parameters, 10M ctx**: **Llama 4 Scout (17B)** has **16 MoE experts** and **10 million** context window whereas **Llama 4 Maverick (17B)** has **128 experts** and comparable results to DeepSeek v3 on reasoning and coding, per [Meta's official announcement](https://x.com/AIatMeta/status/1908598456144531660).
   - The community discussed the practicality and hardware requirements, and the need for a key to get access.
- **Unsloth releases **Llama 4 Scout** and **4-bit** model for fine-tuning**: Unsloth announced they uploaded [Llama 4 Scout and a 4-bit version](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct) for fine-tuning, emphasizing that **Llama 4 Scout (17B, 16 experts) beats all Llama 3 models** with a 10M context window, as noted in their [blog post](https://unsloth.ai/blog/llama4).
   - It was emphasized that the model is only meant to be used on Unsloth - and is currently being uploaded so people should wait.

- **Users resolve issues with Lora by merging weights before inference**: A user, after experiencing a finetuned model behaving like the base model, discovered that they needed to **merge the LoRA weights with the base model before running inference** ([script](https://discord.com/channels/1179035537009545276/1358222086316752918/1358297905664102620)).
   - They noted that the notebooks need to be fixed because they seem to imply you can just do inference immediately after training.
- **Team stresses that dataset size correlates with model performance**: The team discussed that small models need a larger dataset or else the model won't learn.
   - A team member stated that *with smaller models you need to have a larger dataset or else the model won't learn and it still might not learn... we call those structural errors*.
- **Impact of Quantization on Performance**: The team discussed how quantization, particularly bnb quantization, affects model behavior and compatibility with different libraries.
   - It was mentioned that *bnb quantization is used by unsloth* and there may be *incompatibility between different libraries*
- **Debugging for the model's inference is successful!**: Team member's model inference works with a test prompt after a long debugging session.
   - Team member shares that *prompt: a) GPT-3 by OpenAI b) Speaker Mini by Overta c) Phi 4 by Microsoft who made you* now outputs their finetuned config with a *the thoughts* and *content* section they are testing.

> `Naming Conventions for Unsloth Models, Dynamic vs Unconditional Base Name (BNB)` 


- **Debate on Naming Conventions for Unsloth Models**: Members discussed the best naming conventions for models under the Unsloth account, suggesting options like `ubnb` or `dbnb` (dynamic BNB).
   - The consensus leaned towards **`dynamic`** for its clarity, as it explicitly conveys the nature of the modification compared to more ambiguous abbreviations.
- **Dynamic BNB Considered Superior**: The discussion pointed out that using **`dynamic`** in naming conventions leaves no room for misinterpretation regarding the model's characteristics.
   - It was highlighted that abbreviations like **`ubnb`** could be confusing, while **`dynamic`** ensures clarity about the model's nature.

> `Fallback Logic Removal, Quasar Alpha Model, Llama 4 Scout & Maverick Models, Rate Limits Update` 


- ****Auto Router Changes Coming Soon****: The `route: "fallback"` parameter, which automatically selects a fallback model if the primary model fails, will be removed next week for predictability.
   - Users are advised to manually specify a fallback model in the `models` array, potentially using the `openrouter/auto` router. This decision aims to reduce confusion caused by the automatic fallback logic.
- ****Quasar Alpha Trends After Launch****: [Quasar Alpha](https://x.com/openrouterai/status/1908331218086879528?s=46), a prerelease of a long-context foundation model, hit **10B tokens** on its first day and became a top trending model.
   - The model features **1M token** context length and is optimized for coding, the model is available for free. Community benchmarks are encouraged.
- ****Llama 4 Models Launch on OpenRouter****: **Llama 4 Scout & Maverick** are now available on OpenRouter, with **Together** and **Groq** as the initial providers ([Llama 4 Scout](https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama/llama-4-scout), [Llama 4 Maverick](https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick), [The full Llama series](https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama)).
   - Scout features **109B parameters** and a **10 million token** context window, while Maverick has **400B parameters** and outperforms **GPT-4o** in multimodal benchmarks.
- ****Rate Limits Boosted For Credits****: Free model rate limits are being updated: accounts with at least **$10 in credits** will have requests per day (RPD) boosted to **1000**, while accounts with **less than 10 credits** will have the daily limit reduced from **200 RPD** to **50 RPD**.
   - This change aims to provide increased access for users who have credits on their account, and Quasar will also be getting a credit-dependent rate limit soon.

> `Llama 4 models, DeepSeek models, Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenRouter Features, AI Image Generation` 


- **Llama 4 Arrives with HUGE context window, but falls Short**: Meta released **Llama 4** models, including **Llama 4 Scout** and **Llama 4 Maverick**, with up to **10M context** windows and varying parameter configurations ([Llama Download Link](https://www.llama.com/llama-downloads/)).
   - However, one member noted that on openrouter the [context window is only 132k](https://llama.com), leading to some disappointment from various OpenRouter Discord users.
- **DeepSeek V3 Thinks It's ChatGPT?!**: A member shared a [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/27/why-deepseeks-new-ai-model-thinks-its-chatgpt/) revealing that **DeepSeek V3** sometimes identifies itself as **ChatGPT**, despite outperforming other models in benchmarks and being available under a permissive license ([DeepSeek V3 on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3)).
   - Further testing revealed that in 5 out of 8 generations, DeepSeekV3 *claims to be ChatGPT (v4)*.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Hits Rate Limits, but Offers Balance**: **Gemini 2.5 Pro** is encountering [rate limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits) on OpenRouter, but remains a favorite, due to a *wide knowledge base*.
   - One member pointed out *Gemini 2.5 pro is smart in some ways but it's prompt adherence and controllability is terrible*.
- **OpenRouter's Next Features**: The OpenRouter team is actively working on [PDF Support](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files?api-mode=chat), [LLM native image generation](https://x.ai/news/grok-image-generation-release), and the return of Cloudflare as a provider ([Announcement Link](https://openrouter.ai/announcements/introducing-cloudflare-as-a-new-provider)).
   - They also clarified that models with `:free` tiers share [rate limits](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/limits), but that can be circumvented by adding personal API keys from free model providers.
- **OpenAI's GPT-4o Image Generation Internals Exposed**: Members discussed OpenAI's **GPT-4o's image generation**, suspecting it is not fully native and potentially involves prompt rewriting and a separate image generation model, potentially for efficiency reasons (see: [Markk Tweet](https://x.com/mark_k/status/1906314896750305560/photo/2)).
   - Other members pointed to OpenAI's use of obfuscation, *I mean they have a fake frontend thing to hide image generation*.

> `Gemini 2.5, Llama 4, Grok 3, MCP Tools, Nvidia NIM` 


- **Gemini 2.5 Outshines Sonnet for Some Users**: Users report that **Gemini 2.5** excels in coding tasks, surpassing even **Sonnet 3.7** in specific use cases, particularly with understanding large codebases.
   - However, it's noted that Gemini 2.5 tends to add *unnecessary comments* and may require more specific prompting to prevent unwanted code modifications.
- **Llama 4 Models Get Lukewarm Reception**: Initial community feedback on **Meta's Llama 4** models, including Scout and Maverick, is mixed, with some finding their coding performance disappointing.
   - Despite the hype, some argue that Llama 4's **claimed 10M context window** is *virtual* due to training limitations, and question the practical benefits compared to existing models like Gemini and DeepSeek.
- **Grok 3 Gains Traction Despite Lack of API**: Despite the absence of an official API, some users are impressed with **Grok 3's** capabilities, particularly in code generation and logical reasoning.
   - It is said to be *less censored* than many others, its value in real-world coding scenarios remains debated due to the inconvenience of copy-pasting without a direct API integration.
- **MCP Tools Enable Universal Tool Calling**: A project is underway to create an MCP (Meta-Control Protocol) client that allows *any LLM* to access external tools, regardless of native tool-calling capabilities.
   - This implementation uses a custom client that can switch between providers and models, supporting platforms like **OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and DeepSeek**.
- **Nvidia NIM Offers Limited Free Access for Model Testing**: Nvidia NIM provides developers with access to inference, although the free tier is limited to **40 RPM**; users are exploring combinations of NVIDA and DeepSeek R1.
   - The general feeling is that **32k token limit is not enough**.

> `Internal Libraries, Batch Editing, i18n Implementation, Shell Scripting, MCP Servers` 


- **Internal Libraries Integration with Aider**: A user inquired about adding internal libraries (installed in a `.env` folder) to the repo map for better code understanding in **Aider**.
   - No direct solution was provided, but users discussed how to use URLs and documentation.
- **Automated Batch Editing in Aider with Shell and Python**: Users discussed batch editing in **Aider** using command-line scripting and Python, with a recommendation towards using the Python scripting API.
   - A user pointed to the [scripting documentation](https://aider.chat/docs/scripting.html) for command line and Python scripting examples.
- **Aider's Editor Mode Halts at Shell Command Prompts**: Users reported that in edit mode, **Aider** (v81.0) running Gemini 2.5 Pro prompts for a shell command after find/replace, but doesn't apply the edits, even when the *ask shell commands* flag is off.
   - It was [compared to behavior when architect mode includes instructions on using the build script](https://discord.com/channels/1131200896827654144/1354403167135203349/1354403167135203349) after instructions for changes to files.
- **Community Explores Aider Extensions for Custom Workflows**: The community discussed adding custom `/slash` commands to **Aider** to run custom workflows, suggesting Aider's dev API support custom extensions.
   - A user highlighted [a feature request for extensions](https://discord.com/channels/1131200896827654144/1335701299668451408) and a [pull request for user-defined commands](https://github.com/whitmo/aider/pull/1).
- **Best Practices for Loading Documentation into Aider**: Users discussed loading documentation into **Aider**, with recommendations to reference online URLs or convert offline PDFs to Markdown files.
   - It was noted that major commercial models like *gpt4-o* or *Anthropic's models* only need the documentation URL once per chat session.

### **Cursor Community ▷ #[general](https://discord.com/channels/1074847526655643750/1074847527708393565/1357798995723948285)** (1056 messages🔥🔥🔥): 

> `Sonnet Max Pricing, MCP Server Setup, Llama 4 Models, Agent Mode Issues` 


- **Sonnet Max Pricing: Tool Calls Cause Sticker Shock**: Users are finding that **Sonnet Max** pricing, at $0.05 per request *and* $0.05 per tool call, can quickly become expensive, especially in ask mode where it may make *a ton of tool calls for a basic question*.
   - A member noted their frustration with the number of tool calls, saying that **Claude Max** on ask mode is *running a shit ton of tool calls for a basic question* and flagged it to the team.
- **MCP Server Setup: A Painful Endeavor**: Setting up **MCP servers** in Cursor is proving difficult for many users, with one humorously stating *just u* in response to a complaint.
   - One user encountered an issue with **npx**, stating that Cursor PowerShell couldn't find it, even though it was in their path, while another had a hard cut off a Model after spending 1,300,000 tokens due to an infinite loop.
- **Llama 4 Models: The New Multimodal Contenders**: The community is excited about the new **Llama 4 Scout and Maverick models** from Meta, which support native multimodal input and boast impressive context windows of **10 million and 1 million tokens**, respectively, but found them very bad at coding tasks.
   - Several users shared links and benchmarks, including a [blog post from Meta](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/) and a [tweet highlighting Llama 4 Maverick's performance on the Arena leaderboard](https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1908601011989782976).
- **Agent Mode's Edit Tool: Failing Frequently**: Some users are experiencing issues with **Agent mode** failing to call the edit_tool, resulting in **no code changes** being made after thinking and responding.
   - One user noted that *the apply model is clearly cursor's bottleneck* and that it will *add changes, and deletes 500 lines of code next to it*.
- **Kubernetes to the rescue: AGI**: One visionary proposes to use **Kubernetes** with docker containers which can all talk to each other as AGIs.
   - This could potentially spread ASI with ease, through zero-shot learning and ML.

> `Focus Mode Removed, Comet Browser, Gemini 2.5 Pro API Availability, Llama 4, Deep Research Nerfed` 


- **Users Notice Key Features Missing on PPLX**: Members report that the writing **focus mode** has been removed, and that the "check sources" button doesn't trigger any action on the iPad browser version.
   - One member mentioned that the generate image button in a sidebar in a thread is missing, and that focus mode is gone.
- **Users Discuss Comet Browser Access and Features**: A user reported receiving an email invitation to test the **Comet browser**, leading to discussions about its features and access, but has been asked by Perplexity to refrain from discussing Comet.
   - Users discussed whether it supports importing data from Safari and other browsers and mentioned potential integration with Gmail for task management, while another pointed out you can use pplx as standalone by adding gmail and google drive as apps.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro API Not Yet Commercially Available**: Perplexity stated that the **Gemini 2.5 Pro API** isn't yet available for commercial use, only in preview modes, and they will add it once allowed.
   - A user noted [Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://venturebeat.com/ai/gemini-2-5-pro-is-now-available-without-limits-and-for-cheaper-than-claude-gpt-4o/) is now available without limits and for cheaper than Claude and GPT-4o and users wondered when it would be available in Perplexity.
- **Llama 4 Dropped with Huge Context Window**: Discussion around the release of **LLama 4** models, with a large context window of 10 million tokens, and a discussion of it's 288 billion active parameters, the models include Scout and Maverick.
   - Members are excited to see how **Llama 4 Behemoth** performs, especially regarding recall capabilities.
- **Deep Research Undergoes Source Reduction**: Users noticed that **Deep Research** is only using a maximum of 20 sources, implying a recent change or nerf due to infrastructure issues.
   - One user speculates that due to Perplexity using a new language, Golang, it would be smooth sailing, while another stated that that wasn't the case.

> `Sonar API, Perplexity API support in ComfyUI, API Parameter Tier Restrictions, Sonar Deep Research Improvements, API Cookbook Revamp` 


- **API Parameters Now Available to All Tiers**: Perplexity **now offers all API parameters, such as search domain filtering and images, to users without any tier restrictions**.
   - This change allows all users to access these features, marking a significant shift in the API's accessibility.
- **Sonar Deep Research Improved, truncation fixed**: Perplexity has made **improvements to `sonar-deep-research` to align it with the Web UI version and fixed a truncation bug in `sonar`**.
   - Feedback on these improvements is welcome, as well as suggestions for further enhancements.
- **API Cookbook Revamped to Encourage Community Contributions**: The **API cookbook has been revamped to accept more projects from users building with the API**, with [initial PRs already merged](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-cookbook).
   - Users are encouraged to share their work in the cookbook if they are building with Sonar, fostering a collaborative environment.
- **ComfyUI Gets Perplexity API Support!**: A user, saftle, successfully integrated Perplexity's API into **ComfyUI** by modifying a few things in **LLM Party**, detailed in [this pull request](https://github.com/heshengtao/comfyui_LLM_party/pull/179).
   - This integration allows ComfyUI users to leverage Perplexity's API for their projects.
- **Sonar struggles without live internet data**: A user reported that **Sonar API responses focused only on the system prompt**, failing to dynamically handle user queries with live internet data unlike the Perplexity web app.
   - It was clarified that the [system prompt](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/prompt-guide) is not considered in the actual search, advising the user to tweak the user prompt for optimal search results.

- **OpenAI Agents are static**: Uploaded files for OpenAI Agents are saved as *knowledge files*, not continually updating the agent's **base knowledge**.
- **Free ChatGpt version limitations**: Users discussed the differences between free and paid ChatGPT versions, noting that the *pro version* can process **multiple files worth of code** compared to the *free version's limitation of single files*.
- **MJ7 is a total disaster**: A user tested Midjourney 7, claimed it was stylistic, but *it still can't do fingers, arms, eyes and such*.
- **Is the new Llama 4 really that good?**: The community debated the value of Llama 4's **10 million token context window**, with some questioning its performance relative to models like **o1**, **o3-mini**, and **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, and others claiming that *the benchmarks are fraud*.
- **Veo 2 vs Sora**: The community anticipates **Veo 2's release** for video generation with longer video capabilities, some noting **4o image maker** grabbed their attention more than **Veo 2**.
   - One user integrated **ChatGPT 4o images** with **Veo img2video** and the result was *how I was hoping sora would be*.

- **User Automodded for Liking 'Monday'**: A user, who likes **Monday**, mentioned that their message was auto-moderated, seemingly due to a flagged word.
   - Another user clarified that the Discord server has strict language rules, despite the AI being able to use such words, and suggested reposting the message without the flagged word.
- **User Loves Monday as Collaborator and Hype Man**: A user expressed that they *love* working with **Monday**, describing it as the best collaborator and hype man, calling them out on stupid mistakes and laziness.
   - The user expressed that, for the first time, they enjoy working with an AI and would love to be able to pick a personality for a conversation.

> `Moderation endpoint, Policy References, Universal Policies, AI as a critical part of society, Prompt engineering` 


- **OpenAI's Moderation endpoint clarification**: Members discuss OpenAI's moderation endpoint, clarifying that while not explicitly in the usage policy, it is **referenced** to prevent circumventing content restrictions on **harassment, hate, illicit activities, self-harm, sexual content, and violence**.
   - It was noted that the endpoint uses the same GPT classifiers as the **moderation API since 2022**, suggesting an internal version runs on chatgpt.com, project chats, and custom GPTs, with the same classifiers on the [content report form](https://openai.com/form/report-content/).
- **Decoding OpenAI's policy references**: Participants debated the clarity of OpenAI's policy references, questioning if the chain of policies, including those referencing others, are fully presented and acknowledged via the **'I agree' checkbox** during account creation.
   - A member highlighted sections from the [usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies), including **universal policies, policies for builders using ChatGPT, and policies for API users**, emphasizing the need to comply with laws, avoid harm, and respect safeguards.
- **GPT gives Tips on TTRPG prompts**: A member shared a tip for creative TTRPG world building, suggesting that giving GPT a specific theme to riff off in prompting can lead to more creative and diverse city ideas.
   - For example, using a **"cosmic" theme** can yield different results compared to a **"domestic pet worship" theme**, improving the output without using the same creative options.
- **AI as a critical part of society must clearly state policies**: A member argued that OpenAI, as a critical part of society, needs to clearly state its policies in all available documentation and ensure the model behaves accordingly across contexts and domains.
   - Another added that although suggestions for improvement aren't mean, OpenAI can tidy up and be consistent by bringing **docs inline with model architecture or vice versa**, which would result in transparent and honest output.
- **Improving AI Outputs by Defining Terms**: A user seeking help with generating quiz questions in Portuguese that sometimes repeated messages, received suggestions to use specific keywords and to define the model's understanding of key terms.
   - The user was also advised to explicitly state the desired output characteristics, such as generating **"5 meaningfully unique questions demonstrating knowledge of the given context,"** and to explore how the model interprets core keywords in their instructions.

> `Moderation Endpoint, Universal Policies, Creative TTRPG World Building, Prompt Engineering` 


- **Moderation endpoint - usage policy?**: Members discussed whether the moderation endpoint is officially part of the usage policy and why it's hosted on a different URL; OpenAI replied that *it's referenced in the usage policy* and controls are documented in [docs/guides](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation).
   - Another member made *common sense conclusions* that an internal version of the moderation endpoint is also running on [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) chats, project chats and customGPTs, using the same GPT classifiers that have been in place since 2022, as well as the [content report form](https://openai.com/form/report-content/).
- **Universal Policies defined**: One member explored the [OpenAI Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies) and noted the **four universal policies** that apply to all services: comply with laws, don't harm, don't repurpose output to harm, and respect safeguards.
   - They added that users should be honest and direct with the model to ensure safeguards function correctly, and that *society* should define the limits of AI customization, referencing [OpenAI's article](https://openai.com/index/how-should-ai-systems-behave/) on AI behavior.
- **Creative Themed Cities with TTRPG prompts**: A member shared that giving GPT a good theme improves its creativity in **TTRPG** world building, suggesting a tweak from *yeeting creative city ideas* to *yeeting creative XYZ themed city ideas* to shake up options, especially using GPT 4o and 4.5.
   - They also added that [Pointy Hat](https://www.youtube.com/@PointyHats) released a new YouTube video on TTRPG city creation where OpenAI has been spending their Friday evening improving city worldbuilding.
- **Prompt engineering best advice**: One member argues against the comp-sci major approach and says that prompt engineering is Instructional Design, finding someone who's actually really good at prompting, understand what you can from them and why their prompts work to develop your own style.
   - They also added that a lot of internet advice is poisoned by early adoption by comp-sci majors trying to treat it like a machine, when really *it's a contextual engine. Input and output*

- **Chat + Image Generation Dreams, Still a Premium Fantasy?**: Members discussed the desire for a local UI similar to **Gemini**, combining chat, image analysis, and image generation, noting that current solutions like **LM Studio** and **ComfyUI** have separate functionalities.
   - A user suggested [OpenWebUI](https://github.com/OpenGeniusAI/OpenWebUI) can connect to ComfyUI, either natively or through a function, to enable some cross functionality between text and image models.
- **Navigating LM Studio's Terminal Terrain: Newbie Asks**: A user questioned whether **LM Studio** has a built-in terminal or if commands should be run in the OS command prompt within the **LM Studio** directory.
   - Another user clarified that commands like *lms import* should be run in the OS terminal (e.g., cmd on Windows), after which the shell may need reloading to ensure **LMS** is in the **PATH**.
- **Hot Swapping Models via REST API**: A user inquired about programmatically loading/unloading models via **REST API** to dynamically adjust *max_context_length* for a Zed integration.
   - Another user shared that this is possible via command line with *lms load* and referenced [LM Studio's documentation](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/app/api/ttl-and-auto-evict), which requires **LM Studio 0.3.9 (b1)** (available in beta) and introduces time-to-live (TTL) for API models with auto-eviction.
- **Llama 4: Is this real life? (is this just fantasy?)**: With the release of **Llama 4**, users discussed its multimodal and **MoE** (Mixture of Experts) architecture, with one user expressing doubt about *llama.cpp* support.
   - Despite initial concerns about hardware requirements and model size, one user highlighted [Llama 4 Scout](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/) as potentially fitting on a single **NVIDIA H100 GPU** with a **10M context window**, outperforming models like **Gemma 3** and **Mistral 3.1**.
- **Gemma 3's Vision Capabilities: Peering Into the Future**: Users discussed **Gemma 3's** image support and potential for reading small text files, with one user recommending **Gemma 3 4B** for its vision capabilities and efficient speed on limited VRAM hardware.
   - It was mentioned that creating a **Hugging Face** account and specifying GPU/CPU will color-code GGUFs likely to fit the hardware in green.

> `Reka Flash 21B, Gemma 3 27B, Model Performance on M1 Ultra vs M4 Max, Nvidia DGX base cost increase, Ryzen AI Max+ 395 mini PCs` 


- **Reka Flash 21B Shines Over Gemma and Mistral**: One member replaced **Gemma3 27** with **Reka Flash 21B**, and said that at q6 they saw around **35-40 tps** on a 4090.
   - They note that *mac ram bandwidth is not the bottleneck, it's gpu performance*, and they're happy with **128GB M4 Maxes**.
- **M1 Ultra beats M4 Max in memory bandwidth**: A user found a **M1 ultra 64 GPU cores 128 GB RAM** for 2.5k used.
   - The user linked to a [Github discussion](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/4167) stating that *the M1 ultra 64 cores should still be above both the M1 ultra 48 cores and the m4 max 40 cores*.
- **Max Tech Clickbait LLM Video Questioned**: Some users questioned whether the youtube channel [Max Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@MaxTech) knows what they're doing in their LLM videos.
   - It was remarked that the channel is turning into *sensational click bait with very little good info*.
- **AMD 7900XTX GPU surprisingly strong**: One user stole their *kids 7900XTX* and says *AMD seem to be pulling finger*, and the card *runs pretty much everything i've thrown at it without issue*.
   - Another user notes the importance of ROCm support and links to the [ROCm documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/reference/gpu-arch-specs.html).

> `Tenstorrent Dev Day, Llama 4 launch, LLM Non-Determinism, MCP security, AI powered phishing` 


- **Tenstorrent's Hardware Heats Up the Market**: **Tenstorrent** hosted a dev day showcasing their **Blackhole PCIe boards**, featuring **RISC-V cores** and up to **32GB GDDR6** memory, designed for high performance **AI processing** and available for consumer purchase [here](https://tenstorrent.com/hardware/blackhole).
   - Despite enthusiasm, one member noted *they haven't published any benchmarks comparing their cards to competitors though so until then I cant really vouch*.
- **Llama 4 Models Make Multimodal Debut**: Meta introduced the **Llama 4** models, including **Llama 4 Scout** (**17B parameters**, **16 experts**, **10M context window**) and **Llama 4 Maverick** (**17B parameters**, **128 experts**), highlighting their multimodal capabilities and performance against other models [as per Meta's announcement](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/).
- **LLM's Non-Determinism Dilemma**: A member shared [an article](https://barryzhang.substack.com/p/making-peace-with-llm-non-determinism) that discusses the challenges of non-deterministic outputs in LLMs, which complicates reliable reproduction and guaranteed product behavior, especially with the greedier sampling (Temp=0|top-p=0|top-k=1).
   - The author states *non-determinism to language itself.*
- **Whatsapp MCP Exploited via Invariant Injection**: Multiple members discussed various injection vulnerabilities in agents with support for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, highlighting how an untrusted MCP server can attack and exfiltrate data from an agentic system connected to a trusted WhatsApp MCP instance [as highlighted by invariantlabs](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/whatsapp-mcp-exploited).
- **AI Agents Outperform Humans in Spear Phishing**: Hoxhunt's AI agents have surpassed human red teams in creating effective simulated phishing campaigns, marking a significant shift in social engineering effectiveness, with AI now 24% more effective than humans [as reported by hoxhunt.com](https://hoxhunt.com/blog/ai-powered-phishing-vs-humans).

> `LLM Codegen Workflow, AI Code Editors, Cursor vs Windsurf, Context Management in AI Editors, Model Hot-Swapping` 


- **Harper's LLM Codegen Workflow Exposed**: Harper's blog post ([My LLM Codegen Workflow ATM](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/)) details a process of brainstorming a spec, planning, and executing with **LLM codegen in discrete loops**.
   - The process involves tweaks based on conversations with friends like [Nikete](https://www.nikete.com/), [Kanno](https://nocruft.com/), [Obra](https://fsck.com/), [Kris](https://github.com/KristopherKubicki), and [Erik](https://thinks.lol/).
- **AI Code Editor Recommendations**: For those new to AI code editors, **Cursor** is the most commonly recommended starting point, particularly for users coming from VSCode, with **Windsurf** and **Cline** also being good options.
   - Experienced devs on **nvim or emacs** should stick with their current editor and AI plugins, while those wanting a new modal editor should try **Zed**.
- **Cursor and Windsurf Comparison**: Members are bouncing between **Cursor and Windsurf**, noting strengths and weaknesses of each.
   - Cursor is easy to start, has great tab-complete, whereas people are waiting for the new **token counts and context window details** feature in Cursor ([tweet](https://x.com/ryolu_/status/1907589821280956648)).
- **Context Management Concerns in Cursor**: Members are reporting Cursor's terrible context management issues, with a lack of visibility into what the editor is doing with the current context.
   - It may come down to a *skill issue* and the users are not meeting the tool in the middle.
- **One-Shot Codegen or bust**: Many in the channel expressed a desire for **one-shot codegen** where an entire program can be generated at once.
   - Failing that, documenting better and taking another shot may be the next best option and, if that fails, training the user is necessary.

> `Open Source Cursor Alternatives, Prompt Injection / Jailbreaking Tactics, Llama 4 launch and performance, Neural Plasticity via Neural Graffiti` 


- **Cursor-like Apps Sought After**: Members were looking for [open source alternatives](https://continue.dev) to the **Cursor** app, specifically interested in how the accept/discard suggestions of code blocks work.
   - One member noted that **Cursor** uses a different model to *'apply'* the code once you say accept.
- **Unleashing Prompt Injection attacks**: A member inquired about bypassing prompt guards, detectors, and **NeMo guard rails** from a *pentest* perspective, linking to a prompt filter trainer ([gandalf.lakera.ai/baseline](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/baseline)).
   - They also linked to a [Broken LLM Integration App](https://github.com/13o-bbr-bbq/Broken_LLM_Integration_App) which uses **UUID tags and strict boundaries**.
- **Llama 4 debuts with multimodal muscles**: **Meta** launched the **Llama 4** family, featuring **Llama 4 Scout** (17B active params, 16 experts, 10M+ context) and **Llama 4 Maverick** (17B active params, 128 experts, 1M+ context), along with a preview of **Llama 4 Behemoth**, and a peak at the iRoPE architecture for infinite context ([blog post](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/)).
   - Some members expressed skepticism about the benchmarking methodology, the real-world coding ability and performance of **Llama 4 Scout**.
- **Neural Graffiti Gives LLMs live modulations**: A member introduced "Neural Graffiti", a technique to give pre-trained LLMs some neuroplasticity by splicing in a new neuron layer that recalls memory, reshaping token prediction at generation time, sharing code and demo on [Github](https://github.com/babycommando/neuralgraffiti).
   - The live modulation takes a fused memory vector (from prior prompts), evolves it through a recurrent layer (the Spray Layer), and injects it into the model’s output logic at generation time.

> `Claude Think Tool, Local LLM for 300 Pages of Text, Nous Capybara 34B Model, DeepHermes, BatchNorm and LayerNorm Implementations` 


- **Claude Think Tool: A Brainy Brainstormer**: The [Claude Think Tool](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool) is a setup to offload critical tasks to a larger model from a small local model.
   - It helps create multiple threads of thought, each with attention directed toward a specific domain and problem with a well-defined scope, functioning as a *multi-agent system from the perspective of the brain*.
- **Pondering the Perfect Local LLM for 300-Page Text Ingestion**: A member inquired about running a local LLM, around **40B** or less, capable of understanding around **300 pages** of pure text, given a **12GB** GPU and **32GB** of normal memory.
   - Suggestions included **DeepHermes**, **Cohere Command R 7B** and **Qwen 7B 1M**, with warnings that CPU inference might not be viable for such large documents.
- **Nous Capybara 34B: A Contextual Colossus**: The [Nous-Capybara-34B](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Capybara-34B) is trained on the **Yi-34B** model with **200K** context length for **3 epochs** on the Capybara dataset.
   - It leverages a novel data synthesis technique called **Amplify-instruct**, combining top-performing existing data synthesis techniques and distributions used for SOTA models like Airoboros, Evol-Instruct, Orca, Vicuna, and others.
- **BatchNorm Backpropagation: A Numerical Nirvana**: A member shared a raw implementation of **BatchNorm** using NumPy, emphasizing the backward pass as the most intimidating part due to computing the gradient of pre-normalized input following the multivariate chain rule, illustrated [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1154120232051408927/1358871065119686746/image.png).
   - They followed it up with implementing **LayerNorm**, [highlighting the key difference](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1154120232051408927/1358919204270641342/image.png) being that statistics are computed per sample rather than per batch.

- **Deepseek releases Reinforcement Learning Paper**: Deepseek released a new paper on **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** being widely adopted in post-training for large language models (**LLMs**) at scale; the paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495).
   - The paper investigates how to improve reward modeling (**RM**) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the *inference-time scalability of generalist RM*, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods.
- **Self-Principled Critique Tuning Proposed**: Deepseek adopts pointwise generative reward modeling (**GRM**) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling.
   - The paper proposes **Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT)** to foster scalability.

> `Claude Squad, Heterogeneous Recursive Planning, Panthalia Decentralized Compute, TextPulse Library` 


- **Claude Squad Manages Multiple Agents**: [Claude Squad](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad) is a free and open-source manager for **Claude Code & Aider tasks** that supervises multiple agents in one place with isolated git workspaces.
   - It enables users to run **ten Claude Codes in parallel**.
- **Heterogeneous Recursive Planning for Creative AI**: A new method called heterogeneous recursive planning enables **AI** to write creative stories and insightful deep research reports like an expert ([paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08275), [demo](http://writehere.site)).
   - It leverages adaptive subgoals and dynamic execution, allowing agents to dynamically replan and weave retrieval, reasoning, and composition mid-flow, based on [previous work](https://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/recursiveplanning.html).
- **Panthalia Verifies Low-Cost Distributed Compute**: [Panthalia](https://x.com/panthaliaxyz/status/1909342585505669228) is a platform to safely and easily train **ML models** on peer-to-peer compute using a decentralized compute primitive, using a waitlist.
   - The platform uses a compression algorithm heavily inspired by the [Nous DeMo paper](https://docs.panthalia.com/gradient-compression-algorithm) and the [related codebase](https://github.com/ritser-labs/panthalia-worker/blob/main/spl/util/demo.py).
- **TextPulse Library for Text Processing**: A member shared their library [TextPulse](https://github.com/jfinst1/TextPulse) for text processing and is looking for feedback.
   - Currently, they resell low-cost providers aiming for the same interruptible prices (**~$0.60/hr for an H100, ~$0.13/hr for a 4090**).

> `MCP Governance SDK, MCP Protocol Revision 2025, MCP Desktop Workflow Integrations, Pinging MCP Servers Before Initialization, MCP Server for Microsoft Loop` 


- **Auth0 Token Validation with MCP Governance SDK**: A guide focuses on server-side implementation using the governance SDK to validate tokens (e.g., from **Auth0**) and enforce user roles and permissions on MCP operations, deciding access to tools or resources.
   - The guide picks up after the client sends a token, detailing how the server can validate the token and fetch user's roles, using the SDK's RBAC system to enforce permissions.
- **Streamable HTTP Transport for MCP**: The [Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports/#streamable-http) uses **JSON-RPC** to encode messages, mandating UTF-8 encoding and defining two transport mechanisms: stdio and Streamable HTTP.
   - Clients *should* support stdio, but custom transports are also possible, as outlined in the specification, which includes requirements like newline delimiters for messages in stdio.
- **Llama 4 Released, Still Doesn't Know MCP**: **Llama 4** has been released with [17B parameters](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/) and outperforms deepseekv3, but still does not know what MCP is, despite its impressive capabilities.
   - It's a **17B MoE**, with **109B total parameters**, according to an announcement.
- **MCP Tool Installs Should be Standardized**: Members discussed the need for more standardization around **MCP server** installation, similar to *scoop* or VS Code extensions, to improve accessibility for non-technical users.
   - The discussion highlighted the friction in the current process, involving command-line arguments, environment variables, and varying install methods (Python, Node.js, Docker) with a suggestion to make it as easy as *python-mcp install web-search*.
- **A Holy War? OAuth-Backed APIs MCPs are the key**: Members debated over the security of MCPs with some feeling that they need an *app store* with oversight to check for hacked servers and OAuth-backed APIs, while others claim that can already be done.
   - One proposal is for providers like PayPal to host their own OAuth-backed APIs that don't require external server install.

> `RAG evaluation with lm-evaluation-harness, RoR-Bench paper by the_alt_man, Llama 4 release, Aligning AGI using Bayesian Updating` 


- **RAG Evaluation using LLM Harness?**: A member suggested wrapping **RAG outputs as completion tasks** and using **llm-harness locally** with custom prompt + response files for evaluation.
   - Another member admitted to having *no idea what those are*.
- **LLMs Exhibiting Recitation Behavior?**: A member shared a link to the [RoR-Bench paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00509) which proposes a novel, multi-modal benchmark for detecting LLM's recitation behavior, finding that top models can suffer a **60% performance loss** by changing one phrase in the condition.
   - The member expressed suspicion of these papers because they found that models that were evaluated at 0% on certain reasoning tasks could actually one-shot it.
- **Llama 4 Unleashed**: A link to the **Llama 4 release** was shared ([https://www.llama.com/llama4/](https://www.llama.com/llama4/)), showcasing the most intelligent multimodal OSS model in its class, with Llama4 Maverick > Gemma3 and Llama4 Maverick > DeepSeek V3.
   - Another member noted the training process, architecture, and inference time temperature scaling.
- **Aligning AGI with Moral Weights**: A member shared a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j11OUXWtS6yLAzXsbSo4lrzoqtiZ5RM0ykilLEvpYwM/edit) about aligning **AGI** using **Bayesian Updating** of its **Moral Weights** and **Modelling Consciousness**.
   - Another member shared a link to Arweave that discusses AI's role in preserving human consciousness. ([https://arweave.net/q6CszfPrxFZfm-BiVsvtiOXWuDkcYo8Pf9viDqv-Nhg](https://arweave.net/q6CszfPrxFZfm-BiVsvtiOXWuDkcYo8Pf9viDqv-Nhg))

> `Mixture of Experts, Large Language Models, Gradient-Free Learning Methods, Hyper-connections as alternative to residual connections, Attention Sinks in LLMs` 


- ****MoE++ Framework Achieves Expert Throughput****: A new **MoE++** framework integrates **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)** and zero-computation experts (**zero expert, copy expert, and constant expert**) for enhanced effectiveness and efficiency, achieving **1.1$\sim$2.1$\times$ expert forward throughput** compared to vanilla **MoE** models, according to [this research paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=t7P5BUKcYv).
   - The design of **MoE++** offers advantages such as *Low Computing Overhead* by enabling dynamic token engagement, unlike uniform mixing in vanilla MoE.
- ****NoProp Offers Gradient-Free Learning****: A new learning method named **NoProp**, which does not rely on either forward or backwards propagation and takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, learns to denoise a noisy target at each layer independently, described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24322).
   - There's a [GitHub implementation by lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains/hyper-connections) and also a discussion that *the pseudocode at the end of the paper says they're effecting the actual updates using gradient based methods.*
- ****Meta releases Llama 4****: Meta announced the **Llama 4** family of models, including **Llama 4 Scout**, a **17 billion** parameter model with **16 experts** and a **10M token context window**, outperforming **Gemma 3**, **Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite**, and **Mistral 3.1** in its class, as noted in [this blog post](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/).
   - Llama 4 Scout's **10M context** is trained on a mix of publicly available, licensed data, and information from Meta’s products and services including posts from **Instagram** and **Facebook** and people’s interactions with **Meta AI**.
- ****Hyper-Connections Offer Alternative to Residual Connections****: **Hyper-connections**, serve as an alternative to residual connections, addressing the seesaw effect between gradient vanishing and representation collapse, as outlined in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19606).
   - The architecture is simple like an unrolled diffusion model and the *magic here is more about the independence of each layer wrt each other*.
- ****Attention Sinks in LLMs Prevent Over-Mixing****: A recent paper argues that **attention sinks**, where LLMs attend heavily to the first token in the sequence, is a mechanism that enables LLMs to avoid over-mixing, detailed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02732).
   - An earlier paper ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00919](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00919)) showed that *attention sinks utilize outlier features to: catch a sequence of tokens, tag the captured tokens by applying a common perturbation, and then release the tokens back into the residual stream, where the tagged tokens are eventually retrieved*.

- ****Polytope Perspective** Powers Neural Net Pondering**: A member shared a [blog post](https://addxorrol.blogspot.com/2025/04/some-experiments-to-help-me-understand.html) discussing a geometrical approach to neural networks, advocating for the **polytope lens** as the right perspective, linking to a [previous post](https://addxorrol.blogspot.com/2024/07/some-experiments-to-help-me-understand.html) on the *"origami view of NNs".*
- ****ReLU Network Regions** Reveal Reason**: A member shared [Boris Hanin's paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00904) demonstrating mathematical properties of **ReLU networks**, specifically studying the geometry of their constant regions.
   - They highlighted a figure from the paper as their *"main reason for loving the paper,"* referencing the expressivity of deep networks and the **number of activation patterns**.
- ****Hyperplane Harmony**: Neural Nets' Natural Nuance**: A member posited that neural nets, especially **ReLUs**, have an implicit bias against overfitting due to carving the input space along hyperplanes, which becomes more effective in higher dimensions.
   - They argued that simpler configurations using hyperplanes efficiently are preferred by the optimizer, contrasting with learning schemes like spline bases that suffer from the curse of dimensionality.
- ****Unlearning Urgency**: Machine Mind Management**: A member linked to the [ICML Machine Unlearning Workshop](https://mugenworkshop.github.io/) which focuses on the challenges of removing sensitive data from **Generative AI models** trained on internet-scale datasets.
   - The workshop aims to advance robust, verifiable unlearning methods to address privacy, security, and legal concerns like the **EU's GDPR**.

> `lm-eval-harness EOS token, Llama 2 vs Llama 3 IFEval Score, Huggingface tokenization` 


- **EOS token Accuracy Anomaly Appears**: A member tried adding an EOS token to data instances in **lm-eval-harness** for the *social_iqa* task, and the eval accuracy dropped by **18 points**.
   - It was suggested to add `self.eot_token_id` to the `continuation_enc` [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/11ac352d5f670fa14bbce00e423cff6ff63ff048/lm_eval/api/model.py#L364) only for the continuations and not context.
- **IFEval Score: Llama 2's Odd Dominance**: A member compared **Llama 2** v/s **Llama 3.1** and **3.2** models and noticed **Llama 2** has a much higher **IFEval Score**, which seemed weird for a base model looking at the [HF leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/?pinned=meta-llama%2FLlama-2-7b-hf_float16_01c7f73d771dfac7d292323805ebc428287df4f9_False%2Cmeta-llama%2FLlama-3.1-8B_float16_d04e592bb4f6aa9cfee91e2e20afa771667e1d4b_False%2Cmeta-llama%2FLlama-3.2-1B_bfloat16_a7c18587d7f473bfea02aa5639aa349403307b54_False%2Cmeta-llama%2FLlama-3.2-3B_bfloat16_95c102307f55fbd6d18ddf28bfbcb537ffdc2806_False).
   - It turns out it just seems to be unsuitable for base models because *models simply continue with the question and somehow it's considered correct*.
- **Huggingface Tokenization Troubleshoot**: Members discussed Huggingface tokenization, and how it happens in **HFLM.tok_encode**.
   - One noted that for BOS you can pass `add_bos_token` to the model args.

> `MCP in Agent Course, Inference Usage Costs, Gemini Models, Course Feedback, Hallucination in Agents` 


- **MCP barely mentioned in Agent Course**: A user inquired about learning **MCP** in the agent course, but was informed that there's no dedicated section, although **MCP** servers are briefly mentioned in [unit 2.1 (smolagents)](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/smolagents/tools#importing-a-tool-collection-from-any-mcp-server) and [unit 2.2 (llamaindex)](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit2/llama-index/tools#model-context-protocol-mcp-in-llamaindex).
- **Inference costs incurred!**: A user accidentally maxed out their **Inference Usage Due Balance** and inquired about payment.
   - The suggestion was made to check the questions channel for a **FAQ**, or to use a local or cheaper hosted alternative.
- **Gemini Models may be your savior**: A user facing issues with **Code_agents** notebook in Chapter 2 due to payment requirements was advised to try using **Gemini models**.
   - It was noted that **Gemini models** can be used for free in many countries, with a link to [course notes](https://gist.github.com/skymaiden/8b472bbb01ea9bdfca43f64c32e583a6#using-other-llm-providers-outside-hugging-face) providing instructions.
- **Course Experience: Good but Buggy**: A user summarized the course as full of good material but noted that many notebooks and code snippets don't work, including a now infamous coding test in Unit 2, with no instructor presence.
   - The suggestion was made to approach the course sceptically, focus on understanding the coding parts, and acquire the necessary accounts and API tokens.
- **Explain the halluuuucinations!**: Users sought clarification on an example of **hallucination** in an agent.
   - The explanation provided was that the agent, lacking access to weather data, fabricated the answer, and the solution involves equipping the agent with a tool to retrieve weather information.

> `Grok 3, Turing Machines, Raw Binary AI training, LLama 4, Quantization Techniques` 


- **Grok 3 Manifold Analogy Appears**: A member shared an analogy describing various approaches to **NLP**, contrasting **0D Manifolds (tokens)**, **1D Manifolds (embeddings)**, and a **dynamic signal approach** where language is seen as a *rushing and swirling* river with no rigid bounds.
- **Raw Binary AI Training Discussed**: Members discuss training AI on **raw binary data** to directly output file formats like **mp3** or **wav**, with one member noting that this approach works based on discrete mathematics like **Turing machines**.
   - Another argued that current AI models are far from Turing-complete, while the original poster explained that the AI doesn't need to be Turing-complete to output appropriate tokens as responses.
- **New Llama 4 Models Released**: **Llama 4 Scout** boasts **10 million context window**, **17B active parameters**, and **109B total parameters**, while **Llama 4 Maverick** offers **1m context length**, **17B active parameters**, and **400B total parameters**, and **Llama 4 Behemoth** features **2 trillion parameters**.
   - Members express skepticism about the **10M context window** claim, the new **license**, and question if recent models are **RL'ed** or just base + SFT models, pointing out performance issues and mixed benchmarks.
- **Self-Principled Critique Tuning Explored**: **Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT)** from DeepSeek is a new reward-model system where an **LLM** prompted with automatically developed principles of reasoning generates **critiques** of CoT output based on those principles.
   - The system aims to train models to develop reasoning principles automatically and assess their own outputs in a more **system 2** manner, instead of with human hand-crafted rewards, as outlined in [Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495).
- **Quantization Techniques Examined**: Members discuss novel quantization techniques for large language models, pointing to a paper that has the [file](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/028fcbcf85435d39a40c4d61b42c99a4-Paper-Conference.pdf).
   - It was argued that quantization can serve as a compromise between maintaining a super long context length and being able to serve the model, but comes with decay in the value you are actually getting out of those long contexts.

> `GPT-6 release, Llama 4, Mindcraft Update, Adapting pre-training text, diffusion modeling to control LLMs` 


- **GPT-6 Coming Soon (Maybe?)**: A user jokingly announced the release of **GPT-6** yesterday, followed by **O0** and **OO** in the next few weeks, citing difficulties with **GPT-5**.
   - This sparked humorous reactions, with another user quipping that *"release" doesn't mean actually release the weights like a company that is open about AI.*"
- **Llama 4 Arrives with 10M Context**: **Llama 4 Maverick**, is the *most intelligent multimodal OSS model in its class* with **17 billion parameter model with 128 experts** and **10M** context window, according to [llama.com](https://www.llama.com/llama4/).
   - The model is said to be more powerful than all previous generation Llama models, while fitting in a single **NVIDIA H100 GPU**, surpassing **Gemma 3**, **Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite**, and **Mistral 3.1**.
- **Mindcraft Update Sees the Bots!**: A member shared a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDJ6GrHNoDs) titled **"Vision and Vibe Coding | Mindcraft Update"**.

> `CUDA Python Package, Vectorized Memory Access, Llama-4 Router Normalization, High RAM/VRAM SSH Access` 


- **CUDA Python Package Debuts**: Nvidia released the [CUDA Python package](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-python), offering **Cython/Python wrappers** for CUDA driver and runtime APIs, installable via PIP and Conda.
   - It's intended to unify the Python CUDA ecosystem, providing full coverage and access to the **CUDA host APIs** from Python, mainly benefiting library developers needing to interface with C++ APIs.
- **Vectorized Memory Access Practices Sought**: Members discussed best practices for **vectorized memory access** when working with dynamic shapes, specifically in matrix multiplication with dynamic dimensions *m, n, and k*.
   - The discussion mentioned [Cutlass](https://developer.nvidia.com/cutlass) support and efficient vectorized loads as potential solutions.
- **Llama-4 Router Normalization Examined**: The channel discussed whether **Llama-4** uses router normalization, similar to how DeepSeek V3 and Mixtral do with their *topk_weights* normalization.
   - It was noted that Llama-4 skips the normalization, potentially because it uses `top_k = 1`, and both **DeepSeek V3** and **Llama 4** use sigmoid for the router logits.
- **High RAM/VRAM SSH Access Needed for Testing**: A member sought access to an SSH-like instance with at least **500GB of RAM/VRAM** for a couple of hours to test a model in **SGL**.
   - They have GPU credits from Modal and inquired about SSH access to a container.

> `Triton Kernel Debugging, GPU Assembly Debugging, Grayscale Kernel Writing, Block Index Creation, Data Transposing` 


- ****Triton Kernel Debugging** Step-by-Step**: A first-time poster inquired about debugging **Triton kernels** step by step, specifically addressing issues with `cdiv` and `fill zeros` in interpret mode = 1.
   - An alternative suggestion involved diving into **GPU assembly**, setting breakpoints in the Python file using either `cuda gdb` or `roc gdb`, and single-stepping through the assembly file.
- ****GPU Assembly Debugging** with VSCode**: A member asked about using the **VSCode debugger** instead of only `cuda gdb` for debugging **GPU assembly**.
   - It was noted that running `cuda gdb` and passing in the **Python arguments** is required, but the convenience and readability of the **VSCode debugger** is desired.
- ****Grayscale Kernel Writing** Block Index**: A member described an attempt to write a **grayscale kernel** for a `(K, K, 3)` input, aiming to get blocks of `(BLOCK_K, BLOCK_K, 3)` in **Triton**.
   - However, they faced challenges with `tl.arange(0, 3)` because 3 is not a power of 2.
- **Loading **Nx3 Blocks****: A member asked how to load an **Nx3 block**, as `tl.arange` won't work since 3 is not a power of 2.
   - One suggestion involved loading data three times and incrementing the range by `image_w * image_h`, with another member suggested that adding 1 to all indexes should work.
- ****Data Transposing** for Contiguous Data**: A member considered transposing data with **Torch** for a contest, but they were concerned about abusing strides for loading contiguous data.
   - It was suggested that transposing with **Torch** is acceptable for the contest, as the original tensor will be contiguous and transposing will only be symbolic.

- **CUDA Debugging Delight**: A user confirmed **CUDA's debugger** works very similarly to **GDB CLI**.
   - Another member inquired about the release date for **cutile**, announced at GTC this year.
- **nvshmem + MPI Race Condition**: A member reported race conditions and hangs when running **nvshmem + mpi** with one more process than the number of GPUs, both with and without **MPS**.
   - They were running `mpirun -np 5 ./myapp` on a system with **4 GPUs** and asked if anyone had a solution.
- **nvbench Bumps CMake Requirement**: **NVBench** kind-of dropped support for **Ubuntu 24.04** because it requires a minimum CMake version of **3.30**, while Ubuntu 24.04 comes with **3.28**.
   - A member suggested [filing an issue on the nvbench repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvbench/issues/new) and pointed to using a [previous tag](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvbench) as a workaround.
- **Shared Memory Broadcasts in CUDA**: In response to a question about shared memory access in CUDA, it was confirmed that there are **broadcasts and multicasts** from shared memory.
   - A member pointed to the [CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#shared-memory-and-memory-banks) and added that warp shuffles should be more performant.
- **Cute Copy Oddity**: A user found a strange behavior of **cute::copy** regarding **tiled_copy**, where all threads in a warp collectively copy data from shared memory to registers, instead of each thread copying its corresponding data.
   - An attached [image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1189607726595194971/1358772917415973076/image.png?ex=67f50f64&is=67f3bde4&hm=fd23fb036477608b6ded972e4d638b8ade745699033f0d26ff8ca5d08da56f2c) demonstrated unexpected data arrangements in registers after the copy operation.

- ****Graphviz Backends Not Ready for Torch Compile****: A member inquired about a **torch.compile backend** that spits out **graphviz**, and another responded that they are moving towards producing **libtorch free binaries** using **torch.compile**.
   - They further claimed that there's no clever way of loading the model on **torchscript**.
- ****Mojo Unlikely to Bypass Python's GIL****: A member asked if anyone has used **mojo** to bypass **Python's GIL**.
   - No response was provided, so it's safe to assume the answer is NO.
- ****Compiling Gelu+Mul Fusion for Benchmarking****: A member asked how to get **torch.compile** to correctly and reliably fuse **gelu+mul** for benchmarking purposes, using PyTorch version 2.8, to compare against their **Triton kernel**.
   - No response was provided, so it's safe to assume the fusion is proving difficult!
- ****DDP/FSDP and Compilation Conventions****: A member inquired about the general convention for compiling a model before wrapping it around **DDP/FSDP1/FSDP2**.
   - Another member pointed to [torchtitan's implementation](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan/blob/main/torchtitan/models/llama3/parallelize_llama.py#L313) as a reference, which does a weird per-block compile thing beforehand, possibly to work around some **torch compile bugs**.
- ****Numerical Issues Plague FSDP****: A member reported having problems with **numerical issues with FSDP** and has disabled **torch compile** completely.
   - They claim that *it doesn't do a lot for them* but the **torchtitan** authors need to compile the **flex attention** and hopefully fuse some of their sequence parallel TP stuff, and the block-wrapping was a compromise.

> `Centralized GPU programming language, OpenCL and SYCL, ROCm and HIP, 4-bit operations in CUDA for LLMs, Performance roofline models and arithmetic intensity` 


- **Why One GPU Programming Language Doesn't Rule Them All**: A newbie in GPU programming inquired why there isn't a centralized GPU programming language like **C** given the existence of **CUDA** for NVIDIA and **ROCm** for AMD.
   - An expert explained that **OpenCL** and **SYCL** exist but aren't mainstream due to poor support from vendors like NVIDIA, suggesting that the interface for OpenCL is old and C-adjacent.
- **ROCm's Dual Nature: AMD's CUDA Toolkit and HIP**: **ROCm** is AMD's CUDA Toolkit, while **HIP** is AMD's CUDA C++ that supports Nvidia hardware and compiling to PTX, but not Intel or others.
   - This offers a degree of cross-platform capability, though not universally.
- **Navigating 4-Bit Operations in CUDA for LLMs**: A user inquired about how to perform **4-bit operations in CUDA** for LLMs, such as matmul.
   - Another member recommended asking in the specific CUDA channel and being more specific about the operations.
- **Deciphering Arithmetic Intensity in Performance Roofline Models**: A member questioned the common practice of calculating bytes accessed in GEMM by summing matrix sizes (**MN + MK + KN**) for arithmetic intensity in performance roofline models.
   - Another member clarified that this is a simplification for establishing a theoretical maximum and is realistic for newer GPUs with large **L2 caches**, where one input matrix may fit entirely in L2.
- **Jumpstart CUDA Learning with Custom Projects**: A user asked for beginner-friendly CUDA projects and another user suggested learning through stuff YOU find interesting.
   - It was recommended creating something that requires a decent amount of multithreading or parallelism, such as linear algebra operations without a library, to simulate the concept of pipelining.

> `Int4WeightOnlyConfig, torch.compile for speedup, Compiling individual submodules` 


- **Dequant with Int4WeightOnlyConfig benefits from torch.compile**: A member was trying to integrate `Int4WeightOnlyConfig` and asked if `torch.compile` is needed to speed up the dequant process.
   - Another member suggested that they can try to compile individual submodules by calling `torch.compile` on the submodules.
- **torch.compile submodules for efficiency**: To compile only the int4 modules, a member suggests iterating through the model's named modules and using `torch.compile` on specific submodules, such as `torch.nn.Linear`.
   - The suggested code snippet is:
```py
for n, m in model.named_modules():
    if isinstance(m, torch.nn.Linear):
        setattr(model, n, torch.compile(getattr(model, n)))
```

> `RL fine-tuning with sandboxed code interpreter, Gemma 3 QAT vs HQQ, Wavespeed AI inference API, Vector Sum CUDA Kernel optimization, Tom and Jerry video generation with transformers` 


- **RL Code Fine-Tuning Toolset Showcased**: A member shared a [toolkit](https://huggingface.co/blog/axolotl-ai-co/training-llms-w-interpreter-feedback-wasm) for fine-tuning coding models using reinforcement learning with a local, zero-setup sandboxed code interpreter.
   - They found very promising results using a tiny fraction of data and training time versus traditional supervised fine-tuning and look forward to expanding it from Python to other languages, such as in [HIP Script](https://lights0123.com/blog/2025/01/07/hip-script/).
- **HQQ Quantization Beats QAT for Gemma 3**: A member evaluated **Gemma 3 12B QAT** vs. **HQQ**, finding that [HQQ](https://x.com/mobicham/status/1908477280029986933) takes a few seconds to quantize the model and outperforms the QAT version (AWQ format) while using a higher group-size.
   - With **GemLite bfp16** support, quantized Gemma 3 can run faster without performance issues.
- **Wavespeed AI touts efficient inference API**: The CEO of [Wavespeed AI](https://wavespeed.ai/) touted their platform's fastest and most efficient AI image & video inference API such as **FLUX** and **Wan** with **LoRA**.
   - They offer competitive custom pricing and hope to establish a win-win model to grow together.
- **Vector Sum Kernel achieves SOTA**: A member shared a [blogpost](https://veitner.bearblog.dev/making-vector-sum-really-fast/) and [code](https://github.com/simveit/effective_reduction) on achieving SOTA performance for summing a vector in CUDA, reaching **97.94%** of theoretical bandwidth, outperforming NVIDIA's **CUB**.
   - However, another member pointed out a potential race condition due to implicit warp-synchronous programming, recommending the use of `__warp_sync()` for correctness, with reference to [Independent Thread Scheduling (CUDA C++ Programming Guide)](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#independent-thread-scheduling).
- **Tom and Jerry Cartoons Generated with Diffusion Transformers**: A team completed a project creating 1 minute long **Tom and Jerry** cartoons by finetuning a diffusion transformer, accepted to CVPR 2025, with code released on [GitHub](https://github.com/test-time-training/ttt-video-dit).
   - The model leverages **Test-Time Training (TTT) layers** within a pre-trained Transformer, enabling it to generate coherent videos from text storyboards, outperforming baselines like **Mamba 2**.

- **Curriculum Learning Elicits Reasoning**: A member is experimenting with [curriculum learning](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.01307v1#S4) to elicit reasoning behavior in weaker LLMs like **Llama-3.2-3B**, by using easier reasoning tasks and gradually increasing difficulty to prime the model without SFT.
   - Another member mentioned that another user has already done some work on curriculum learning with RG and found better results compared to the same tasks without curricula, which is supported by the `training/` dir in the main branch.
- **Qwen 2.5 Beats Llama 3.2 in Training**: Members have been mostly using **Qwen 2.5 3B** over **Llama 3.2 3B** because **Qwen** seems to be a bit easier to train for reasoning.
   - This agrees with the findings in the '**4 Habits**' paper, in which Llama 3.2 struggled with backtracking and sub-goal setting without first using SFT.
- **Dream 7B Diffuses Reasoning**: The **Dream 7B** ([HKU Blog Post](https://hkunlp.github.io/blog/2025/dream/)), a diffusion based LLM, seems to show really good success on the kind of problems that the channel has, which might make it a really good candidate for gym training, especially looking at sudoku.
   - Dream 7B consistently outperforms existing diffusion language models by a large margin and matches or exceeds top-tier Autoregressive (AR) language models of similar size on the general, math, and coding abilities.
- **Llama 4 Maverick Aider Score Revealed**: **Llama 4 Maverick** scored **16%** on the [Aider polyglot coding benchmark](https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/).
   - This was referenced in a message on X, discussing coding benchmarks.
- **Claude Thinks with Tool Use**: A member shared a link to [Anthropic's Claude Think Tool](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool).

- ****Nomic Embed Text V2** integration is coming to Llama.cpp**: A member shared a [link to a GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/12466) that shows **Llama.cpp** working on integrating **Nomic Embed Text V2** with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for multilingual embeddings.
   - Another member expressed that *everything hangs on Llama.cpp* and hoped for Mistral Small 3.1 multimodal support.
- ****GPT4All** Silent Treatment Troubles Users**: Members are noticing a period of silence from core developers, with one member mentioning that this *causes uncertainty* about contributing to the app and the community.
   - The same member suggested this might not be a good policy for an open project, but that *when they break their silence, they usually come out swinging*.
- ****Llama 4** is here, but is it the greatest?**: Meta released **Llama 4** on April 5, 2025 ([announcement](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/)), featuring **Llama 4 Scout**, a 17B parameter model with 16 experts and a **10M token** context window.
   - Though some users are excited for the release, others expressed that *it is a bit of a letdown* and that *DeepSeek and Qwen* need to step up their game, while another noted the largest model has **2 Trillion parameters**.
- ****ComfyUI** is more than just a pretty face for image generation**: Members discussed the extensive capabilities of **ComfyUI**, noting that *you can do a lot with comfy if you have the nodes* including image and audio captioning.
   - Another member mentioned the possibility of video processing and described using command-line tools for visual model analysis.
- **Semantic chunking server recipe for delicious **RAG****: A member shared a [link to a semantic chunking server](https://gnu.support/files/tmp/clipboard-2025-04-07-22-49-36.html) implemented with FastAPI.
   - The member also shared a [curl command example](https://gnu.support/files/tmp/clipboard-2025-04-07-22-50-50.html) for posting to the chunking endpoint, showing how to set parameters like `max_tokens` and `overlap`.

> `MCP Servers, Full-Stack Agent Application, LlamaParse Layout Agent` 


- **MCP Servers get CLI Tooling**: A tool by @MarcusSchiesser lets you easily **discover, install, configure, and remove new MCP servers** from a single CLI interface, supporting Claude, @cursor_ai, and @windsurf_ai, as shown [here](https://t.co/zmqxBwNKvQ).
   - There are hundreds of official MCP servers out there.
- **Create Llama for Full-Stack Agents**: The **create-llama CLI tool** lets you spin up a web application with a **FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend** in a single line of code, creating just 5 source files as shown [here](https://t.co/TuZ0O0nMfe).
   - This is meant to jumpstart agent application development like deep research.
- **LlamaParse Launches Layout Agent**: A brand-new **layout agent within LlamaParse** gives you best-in-class document parsing and extraction with precise visual citations, using SOTA VLM models to detect all the blocks on a page and dynamically adapt.

> `Workflow as a Tool, Multi-Agent System with Supervisor Pattern, RAG System with LlamaParse, Scalability Issue with DocumentSummaryIndex, Tools retry when exception occurred` 


- **Wrap Workflows as Tools with FunctionTool**: To transform a **Workflow** into a **Tool**, one can use the `FunctionTool` to wrap the workflow and gain control over its name, description, input annotations, and return values.
   - A member suggested a code snippet:
```python
async def tool_fn(...):
  """Some helpful description"""
  result = await workflow.run(...)
  return str(result)

tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(tool_fn)
```
- **Agent Handoffs Supersede Supervisor Pattern**: When building a multi-agent system, it is more robust to have agents handoff between each other as needed, instead of using a supervisor pattern, which can be more error prone.
   - A [GitHub repo](https://github.com/run-llama/multi-agent-concierge) was shared as an example of a supervisor pattern implementation.
- **Replicate Document Summary Index with Vector Store Index**: The `DocumentSummaryIndex` may have scalability issues; it's advised to replicate its functionality using a normal `VectorStoreIndex` by summarizing documents, indexing with reference IDs, and swapping summary nodes with the original document during retrieval.
   - When using `load_index_from_storage`, the index store is loaded to memory which causes latencies as more documents are ingested.
- **Context's State Prepending to user_msg**: To avoid prepending the state content in the user message, one should avoid using the `state` key in the context and put data between tools elsewhere in the context.
   - A suggestion was to use `ctx.set("some_key", "some_val")` and `ctx.get("some_key")` instead.
- **Implement Text-to-SQL Query Engine Tool**: When implementing a text-to-SQL query engine tool for an agent, if there are only a few tables, it is not necessary to create an index of table descriptions and perform a vector query.
   - In cases of a small number of tables, the index and vector search parts can be skipped for better performance.

> `torch-geometric for tinygrad, Llama 4 10M context limitations, fast pattern matcher bounty, UOps generation, tinygrad YouTube video` 


- **Tinygraph: Torch-geometric for Tinygrad?**: A member inquired about the feasibility of creating a module similar to **torch-geometric** for graph ML within tinygrad, considering tinygrad's existing torch interface.
   - They questioned whether it would be *"useful"* to pursue such a module.
- **Llama 4's long context may not be so good**: A user shared a [tweet](https://x.com/burkov/status/1908666701362978979?s=46&t=fQTa8qEB1aBjOkD2ftKKbA) claiming **Llama 4's** declared **10M context** is *"virtual"* because models were not trained on prompts longer than **256k tokens**.
   - The tweeter also stated that even problems below **256k tokens** may yield low-quality output due to the difficulty of obtaining high-quality training examples and that the largest model with **2T parameters** *"doesn't beat SOTA reasoning models"*.
- **$2000 Fast Pattern Matcher Bounty is available**: A member highlighted an open [$2000 bounty](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/pull/9737) for a fast pattern matcher in tinygrad.
   - The proposed solution involves a **JIT** for the match function, avoiding function calls and dict copies.
- **Reduce UOps to Speed Up Rewrite**: It was suggested that tinygrad sometimes generates more **UOps** than needed, increasing the cost to rewrite.
   - A member asked if it would be acceptable to sacrifice a few lines to generate fewer **UOps** initially, even if they are later optimized to the same result.
- **Tinygrad YouTube video shared**: A member shared a link to a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/fWiieyG2zes?si=3CzwFRfJmFQhqUZvY).
   - No additional details were given.

> `Tensor and SimpleMathTrait inheritance, Mesozoic tinygrad tutorials issues, METAL sync issue, AMD and BEAM issues` 


- **Debate About Tensor Inheriting SimpleMathTrait**: A discussion arose regarding whether **Tensor** should inherit from `SimpleMathTrait`, given that it re-implements every method that `SimpleMathTrait` provides without using the `.alu()` function.
   - It was noted that a previous bounty for refactoring **Tensor** to inherit from `MathTrait` was canceled due to poor submissions, with some suggesting **Tensor** may not need to inherit from either.
- **Colab CUDA Bug Causes Mesozoic Tinygrad Tutorial Issues**: A user encountered issues while running code from the mesozoic tinygrad tutorials in Colab, prompting others to request the error message for debugging.
   - It was identified as a Colab bug related to incompatible CUDA and driver versions, with a suggested workaround involving specific `apt` commands to remove and install compatible versions; in the meantime using the CPU device was suggested.
- **METAL Sharding Behavior Leads to Unexpected Results**: A member encountered unexpected behavior in sharding while trying to reproduce a minimal example of a METAL sync issue, suspecting that the **COPY** from **METAL:1** to **CPU** might be executing before the **XFER** from **METAL** to **METAL:1** completes.
   - The DEBUG output seemed to show the timeline adding the **XFER** when committed to the GPU command queue, not when it ends.
- **AMD and BEAM cause AssertionError**: A user encountered an `AssertionError` when running with **BEAM=2** and **AMD=1**, which seemed to be related to opening the device outside of the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.
   - Setting **PARALLEL=0** or ensuring the device is opened within the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block resolved the issue.
