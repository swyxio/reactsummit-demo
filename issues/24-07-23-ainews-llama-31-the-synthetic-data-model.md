Including the 405B model, which triggers both [the EU AI act](https://x.com/deanwball/status/1815826885663658445?s=46) and [SB 1047](https://x.com/martin_casado/status/1815865505204576389). The [full paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/) has all the frontier model comparisons you want:

We'll assume you read the headlines from [yesterday](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-llama-31-leaks/). It's not up on LMsys yet, but independent evals on [SEAL](https://x.com/summeryue0/status/1815776426999877643) and [Allen AI's ZeroEval](https://x.com/billyuchenlin/status/1815841947468353700?s=46) are promising (with some [disagreement](https://x.com/hrishioa/status/1815811349777375649?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug)). It was a well coordinated launch across ~every inference provider in the industry, including (of course) Groq showing a flashy demo inferencing at [750tok/s](https://x.com/JonathanRoss321/status/1815777714642858313). Inference pricing is also out with [Fireworks leading the pack](https://x.com/HamelHusain/status/1815852454027940135).

While it is well speculated that the 8B and 70B were ["offline distillations"](https://x.com/kalomaze/status/1815797116104556565) of the 405B, there are a good deal more synthetic data elements to Llama 3.1 than the expected. The paper explicitly calls out:

- **SFT for Code**: [3 approaches for synthetic data](https://x.com/swyx/status/1815771160841425113) for the 405B bootstrapping itself with code execution feedback, programming language translation, and docs backtranslation.
- **SFT for Math**: ![https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTLqFD9aMAAwYUQ?format=png&name=900x900](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTLqFD9aMAAwYUQ?format=png&name=900x900)
- **SFT for Multilinguality**: "To collect higher quality human annotations in non-English languages, we train a multilingual expert by branching off the pre-training run and continuing to pre-train on a data mix that consists of 90% multilingual
tokens."
- **SFT for Long Context**: "It is largely impractical to get humans to annotate such examples due to the tedious and time-consuming nature of reading lengthy contexts, so **we predominantly rely on synthetic data to fill this gap.** We use earlier versions of Llama 3 to generate synthetic data based on the key long-context use-cases: (possibly multi-turn) question-answering, summarization for long documents, and reasoning over code repositories, and describe them in greater detail below"
- **SFT for Tool Use**: trained for Brave Search, Wolfram Alpha, and a Python Interpreter (a special new [`ipython`](https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama3_1) role) for **single, nested, parallel, and multiturn function calling**.
- **RLHF**: DPO preference data was used extensively on Llama 2 generations. As [Thomas says on the pod](https://www.latent.space/p/llama-3): *“Llama 3 post-training doesn't have any human written answers there basically… **It's just leveraging pure synthetic data from Llama 2.**”*

Last but not least, Llama 3.1 [received a license update](https://x.com/AIatMeta/status/1815766335219249513) explicitly allowing its use for synthetic data generation.

We finally have a [frontier-class open LLM](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1815842603377779140), and together it is worth noting how far ahead the industry has moved in [cost per intelligence since March](https://x.com/swyx/status/1815892458519289946/photo/1), and it will only get better from here.

> - `context_window parameter`
> - `chunk_size and chunk_overlap`
> - `model availability and context size`
> - `ValueError in LlamaIndex`
> - `using models with larger context windows` 


- **Understanding the context_window parameter**: The `context_window` parameter specifies the maximum number of tokens the model can handle, including both input and output tokens.
   - If the input text is too long, it may restrict output generation, leading to errors if the token limit is exceeded.
- **Defining chunk_size and chunk_overlap**: `chunk_size` sets the maximum number of tokens in each chunk during processing, while `chunk_overlap` defines the number of overlapping tokens between consecutive chunks.
   - These parameters help control the precision of embeddings and ensure context is retained across chunks.
- **Addressing ValueErrors in LlamaIndex**: A ValueError indicating a negative context size suggests the input text exceeds the current model's `context_window` limit.
   - Reducing input size or switching to a model with a larger context window are potential resolutions.
- **Maximize model efficiency with context_window**: In cases where the context window is reached, it may limit the model's output capacity significantly.
   - Choosing models with appropriate `context_window` values based on input length is essential for optimal performance.
- **Discussion on context_window's scope**: Clarifications were shared regarding whether `context_window` covers only input tokens or includes outputs as well.
   - It was confirmed that the `context_window` encompasses both, necessitating careful management of input sizes.

- **Help needed for matmul-free-llm recreation**: There's a request for assistance in recreating **matmul-free-llm** with tinygrad, aiming to leverage [efficient kernels](https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm/blob/master/mmfreelm/ops/fusedbitnet.py) while incorporating **fp8**.
   - *Hoping for seamless adaptation to Blackwell fp4 soon*.
- **M1 results differ from CI**: An M1 user is experiencing different results compared to CI, seeking clarification on setting up tests correctly with **conda** and environment variables.
   - *There's confusion due to discrepancies when enabling `PYTHON=1`, as it leads to an IndexError in tests.*
- **cumsum performance concerns**: A newcomer is exploring the **O(n)** implementation of **nn.Embedding** in tinygrad and how to improve **cumsum** from O(n^2) to O(n) using techniques from PyTorch.
   - *There’s speculation about constraints making this challenging, especially as it's a **$1000 bounty**.*
- **TensorFlow and PyTorch tensor operations differences**: Discussion is ongoing about the differences in behavior between **TensorFlow bitcast** and **PyTorch view**, primarily in how dimensions are handled.
   - *Adding or removing dimensions can cause confusion, with some suggesting that the behavior of TensorFlow makes more sense in this context.*
- **Testing issues with bitcast and view**: Testing issues arise with `PYTHON=1` due to the device's support differences between **view** and **bitcast**, causing shape compatibility problems.
   - *There is agreement that while PyTorch and NumPy expand or contract dimensions, TensorFlow's method adds a new dimension.*

> - `Molecular Dynamics Engine in Tinygrad`
> - `Gradient Calculations`
> - `Neural Network Potentials` 


- **Seeking Pattern for Incremental Testing with PyTorch**: A member inquired about effective patterns for incrementally testing model performance in the sequence of **Linear, MLP, MoE,** and **LinearAttentionMoE** using PyTorch.
   - They questioned whether starting tests from scratch is more efficient than incremental testing.
- **Developing Molecular Dynamics Engine in Tinygrad**: A group is attempting to implement a **Molecular Dynamics engine** in tinygrad to train models predicting energies of molecular configurations, facing challenges with gradient calculations.
   - They require the gradient of predicted energy concerning input positions for the force, but issues arise because they backpropagate through the model weights twice.
- **Need for Efficient Gradient Calculation**: The developer explained the challenge of calculating the energy/position gradient through a different graph, similar to **torch.autograd.grad** in PyTorch.
   - This is crucial for ensuring the first gradient computation doesn't affect the loss calculation, and they plan to share a minimal example for assistance.
- **Encouragement for PR with Minimal Reproduction**: George Hotz suggested that the developer should post a minimal reproduction of the issue along with the expected behavior to facilitate better assistance.
   - He recommended that this minimal example could ideally be added as a test in a pull request (PR).
- **Connection to Neural Network Potentials**: Another member, James Wiles, queried whether the Molecular Dynamics project is linked to **Neural Network Potentials**.
   - This indicates an interest in how these concepts might intersect within the context of their work.
