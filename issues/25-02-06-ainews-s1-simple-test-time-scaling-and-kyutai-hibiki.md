> AI News for 2/5/2025-2/6/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**210** channels, and **4396** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **490 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

We're regrettably late to covering this paper, but late is better than never. [s1: Simple test-time scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393) documents a new reasoning model with 2 novel contributions:

- finetuned from Qwen 2.5 32B on **just 1000 questions paired with reasoning traces** distilled from Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, filtered for difficulty, diversity, and quality (26 mins of training on 16 H100s)
- controllable test-time compute by either forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end.

Lead author [Niklas Muennighoff](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Me0IoRMAAAAJ&hl=en), who notably worked on Bloom, StarCoder, MTEB, and contributed to BIG-bench, [notes](https://x.com/Muennighoff/status/1886405528777073134) that this second trick reproduces the famous o1 scaling chart:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/bc28620b-478b-4847-bddb-df5360b4c34f.png?w=960&fit=max)

Compared to Bespoke-Stratos ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-bespoke-stratos-sky-t1-the-vicunaalpaca/)), the filtering is also remarkably sample efficient.

We would also recommend [Simonw](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/5/s1-the-6-r1-competitor/) and [Tim Kellogg](https://timkellogg.me/blog/2025/02/03/s1)'s explainers.

**Honorable mention today:**

**Kyutai Moshi** made a splash last year ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-o1-destroys-lmsys-arena-qwen-25-kyutai/)) for its realtime voice with inner monologue, and now Hibiki shows [very impressive French-English live translation offline on an iPhone](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ij35u7/hibiki_by_kyutai_a_simultaneous_speechtospeech/). Not bad for an [intern project](https://x.com/kyutai_labs/status/1887495511474573517).

**Theme 2. Challenges with Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental Model**

- **The New Gemini Pro 2.0 Experimental sucks Donkey Balls.** ([Score: 205, Comments: 83](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iirej3/the_new_gemini_pro_20_experimental_sucks_donkey/)): The author criticizes the **Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental** model for its poor performance compared to the previous **1206** model, highlighting issues like frequent mistakes and unwanted code refactoring. They express frustration with Google's pattern of releasing models that regress in quality, contrasting it with the impressive speed and efficiency of the **Flesh light 2.0** for OCR tasks.
  - Many users express dissatisfaction with **Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental**, noting issues like decreased intelligence and increased speed at the cost of quality, with some preferring the older **1206** model or other models like **Flash 2.0** for better performance in specific tasks like coding and creative writing.
  - **Flash 2.0** and **o1** models are praised for their effectiveness, especially in handling complex queries and maintaining context over longer tasks, while newer models like **o3-mini** are criticized for requiring more verbose input to understand user intent, leading to inefficiencies.
  - The discussion highlights a broader trend where AI models are becoming faster and more efficient but at the expense of depth and consistency, with some users pointing out the limitations of current evaluation metrics and the challenges of balancing speed with quality in real-world applications.


**Theme 3. Open WebUI Releases Code Interpreter and Exa Search Features**

- **Open WebUI drops 3 new releases today. Code Interpreter, Native Tool Calling, Exa Search added** ([Score: 185, Comments: 61](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iisj7j/open_webui_drops_3_new_releases_today_code/)): **Open WebUI** introduced significant updates in version **0.5.8**, including a **Code Interpreter** that executes code in real-time using **Pyodide**, a redesigned chat input UI, and **Exa Search Engine Integration** for retrieving information within the chat. Additionally, **Native Tool Calling Support** is now available experimentally, promising reduced query latency and improved contextual responses. [Release details](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/releases) are available online.
  - **Code Interpreter and Pyodide**: Users appreciate the addition of the code interpreter using **Pyodide**, noting its limitations but recognizing its utility for common use cases. There's a call for improvements such as integrating **Gradio** and enabling result downloads, like plots or processed data.
  - **Community Contributions**: Despite many contributors, **tjbck** is acknowledged as the primary consistent contributor to **Open WebUI**, with suggestions to support them through [GitHub sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/tjbck). The project is praised for its rapid feature updates and its competitive edge over proprietary UIs.
  - **Document Handling and RAG**: There are criticisms regarding document handling, particularly the use of simple vector DB RAG for single document references, which often fails on simple queries. Suggestions include moving document, RAG, and search functionalities to separate pipelines to keep up with fast-moving advancements, and disabling RAG by default for better user control.


**Theme 4. Over-Tokenized Transformer Enhances LLM Performance**

- **[Over-Tokenized Transformer - New paper shows massively increasing the input vocabulary (100x larger or more) of a dense LLM significantly enhances model performance for the same training cost](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iiwmsq)** ([Score: 324, Comments: 37](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iiwmsq/overtokenized_transformer_new_paper_shows/)): A new paper demonstrates that massively increasing the input vocabulary of a dense **Large Language Model (LLM)** by 100 times or more significantly boosts model performance without increasing training costs. This finding suggests a potential strategy for improving transformer efficiency by expanding the vocabulary size.
  - **Tokenization and Vocabulary Size**: Increasing the vocabulary size to millions, as opposed to the typical **32k to 128k**, can enhance model performance by using more meaningful, hierarchical tokens. This approach achieves faster convergence by combining multiple tokens into new ones, though it primarily improves training performance rather than final performance in direct proportion.
  - **Potential Challenges and Considerations**: Concerns arise about undertrained tokens due to greedy tokenizers, which might lead to performance issues with misspellings and tasks sensitive to single character mutations, such as arithmetic or algebraic reasoning. There are also questions regarding the impact on memory usage, inference speed, and effective context size when using smaller tokens.
  - **Research and Comparisons**: A similar study from three months ago suggested that models like **Llama 2 70B** should use at least **216k tokens** for optimal compute use, and even larger token counts could be beneficial. The paper's findings are particularly interesting for dense models, but they did not show the same improvement for **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** models, highlighting a potential area for further exploration.

> `LLMs in Classification, Latency Requirements in ML, Composite Pipeline for Noisy Data` 


- **LLMs excel in classification but struggle with noise**: A member emphasized that while **LLMs** are effective for classification, **noisy data** demands additional techniques like dense embeddings and autoencoder rerankers to enhance performance.
   - This indicates that a more complex approach may be necessary when dealing with challenging data environments.
- **Latency concerns when using LLMs**: Discussion revealed that while LLMs can classify well, it may be impractical to use them in scenarios with strict **latency requirements** due to their processing limits.
   - The conversation concluded that the suitability of LLMs really hinges on the specific latency constraints of a given application.
- **Reframing business requirements for ML solutions**: A member mentioned that there was a **missed opportunity** in properly framing the business requirements when transitioning to an ML problem.
   - They noted that it should have been apparent from the start that if low-latency is critical, traditional LLMs might not be the best fit.
