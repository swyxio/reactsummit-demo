## [DiscoResearch](https://discord.com/channels/1178995845727785010) Discord Summary

- Detailed discussion on Mixtral implementation and training configurations:
    - Inquiry about the "**Gate Layer Freezing**" technique in Mixtral training, with a reference to a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/erhartford/status/1737350578135834812) by Eric Hartford stating the significance of this approach. The question arose regarding the application of this technique in Axolotl.
    - Share of **Dolphin 2.6 training configurations** on Mixtral-8x7b by Eric Hartford, accessible [here](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.6-mixtral-8x7b/blob/main/configs/dolphin-mixtral-8x7b.yml). Whether this approach is the most efficient was brought into question.
    - Performance discussion of the **Dolphin 2.6 model**, indicated as more 'dolphin-like' than its predecessor at the 1.5-epoch mark, with no model refusals noticed.
    - Inquiry about successful **8-bit training with Mixtral script** in an H100 pod, particularly in relation to Axolotl.

- Conversation on software for quick OpenAI-compatible operations:
    - Proposal of a **software solution** for instant OpenAI-compatible API interactions and predefined actions via a hotkey, insightful across any operating system. 
    - Suggestion of software, [uniteai](https://unite.ai/) and [ClipboardConqueror](https://github.com/aseichter2007/ClipboardConqueror), that might meet some of these requirements. 
    - Interest expressed in developing such a software if it does not exist.

- **Gate Layer Freezing in Mixtral Implementation**: User `@sebastian.bodza` referenced a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/erhartford/status/1737350578135834812) by Eric Hartford stating the importance of freezing the gate layer during Mixtral training. He wondered if this technique has been implemented in Axolotl.
- **Dolphin 2.6 Training Configurations**: `@sebastian.bodza _jp1_` mentioned that Eric Hartford has shared his Dolphin 2.6 training configurations on Mixtral-8x7b, available [here](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.6-mixtral-8x7b/blob/main/configs/dolphin-mixtral-8x7b.yml). However, it is unclear if this is the most efficient training approach.
- **Dolphin 2.6 Model Performance**: User `@rtyax` indicated that Dolphin 2.6 is more 'dolphin-like' than version 2.5 at the 1.5-epoch mark, and noted that they did not observe any model refusals.
- **8-bit Training with Mixtral Script**: `@tcapelle` asked if anyone in the server has been able to successfully train using an 8-bit Mixtral script in an H100 pod. Tcapelle also offered to run any experiments if provided with a configuration file. He later specified this question applied to application in Axolotl.

- **Software for Quick OpenAI-compatible Questions and Actions**: `@.grey_` asked if there exists software allowing users to quickly ask questions through any OpenAI compatible API, or use clipboard content for predefined actions via a hotkey, working across any operating system. This software could ideally integrate with the OS's context menus, similar to Alfred or Spotlight on MacOS.
- `@.grey_` also mentioned that this tool could be used for quick questions, predefined actions, or opening a chat without requiring a full context. It is especially useful when having a one-off question or needing a quick response while reading something.
- `@bjoernp` responded that they were not aware of such a software but found the idea useful.
- `@rtyax` suggested [uniteai](https://unite.ai/), an lsp server that can fit into IDEs and can bind lsp actions to a hotkey. `@rtyax` also mentioned [ClipboardConqueror](https://github.com/aseichter2007/ClipboardConqueror), a GitHub project, which could meet some of `@.grey_`'s needs.
- `@.grey_` also expressed interest in developing such a software if it does not already exist.

- **AI Events of the Year**: `@swyxio` shared a [link](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/a-song-of-hype-and-fire-the-10-biggest-ai-stories-of-2023/) to an article summarizing the biggest AI stories of 2023.
- **Mamba Model Mention**: `@swyxio` briefly mentioned the Mamba model, although no further details were provided.
- **Discussion on LangChain Utility**: `@cakecrusher` questioned the utility of LangChain and asked for reasons to use it over ChatGPT. In response, `@lightningralf` suggested that LangChain allows for easy swapping between different add-ons like vector stores. 
- **Building RAG That Considers Temporal Factors**: `@swizec` suggested to `@gratchie1188` the possibility of creating a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model that values relevancy and temporality. If simple temporal distance weighing does not perform well, a summarization-based recursive memory system could be implemented.
