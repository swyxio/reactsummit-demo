[Romain Huet's](https://twitter.com/romainhuet) demo of GPT-4o using an unreleased version of ChatGPT Desktop [made the rounds yesterday](https://x.com/tsarnick/status/1806526891354132604) and was essentially the second-ever high profile demo of GPT-4o after the release ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-gpt-4o-the-new-sota-everything-frontier/)), and in the absence of bigger news is our pick of headliner today:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f3179985-63dd-4431-8803-f2f0c1bc62ad.png?w=960&fit=max) 

The demo starts at [the 7:15:50 mark on stream](https://www.youtube.com/live/vaIiNZoXymg?si=S73xOMIAlTOvAzEc&t=26153), and you should watch the whole thing.

Capabilities demonstrated:

- low latency voicegen
- instructions to moderate tone to a whisper (and even quieter whisper)
- interruptions
- Camera mode on ChatGPT Desktop - constantly streaming video to GPT4o
-  ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/c5cfc90d-8127-4e20-ae47-10486b61be2b.png?w=960&fit=max) 
- When paired with voice understanding it eliminates the need for a Send or Upload button
- **Rapid OCR**: Romain asks for a random page number, and presents the page of a book - and it reads the page basically instantly! Unfortunately the OCR failed a bit - it misread "Coca Cola" but conditions for the live demo weren't ideal. 
 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f8837ed4-8e51-4be2-bcc8-d4df999156a0.png?w=960&fit=max) 
- **Screen Sharing with ChatGPT**: talking with ChatGPT to describe his programming problem and having it understand from visual context
 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/2bf81e11-7a9c-40d0-aab7-630fc3749825.png?w=960&fit=max) 
- **Reading Clipboard**: copies the code, asks for a "one line overview" of the code (This functionality exists in ChatGPT Desktop today)
- **Conversing with ChatGPT about Code**: back and forth talking about Tailwind classnames in code, relying on vision (not clipboard) 
![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/80b51c10-dd96-4e33-ab8a-5c3acec13c23.png?w=960&fit=max) 

The rest of the talk discusses 4 "investment areas" of OpenAI:

- **Textual intelligence** (again using "GPT Next" instead of "GPT5"...)
 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/09da9fa4-0123-4f40-b3f8-b927b210508f.png?w=960&fit=max) 
- **Efficiency/Cost**  ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/21d2c62d-f81d-4d88-9378-787e644e4667.png?w=960&fit=max) 
- **Model Customization** ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/acbc1d92-631b-4f7e-ae3e-057ee9451558.png?w=960&fit=max)

- **Debate over yoco and kv cache**: Members discussed the **kv cache** strategy in various architectures, particularly **yoco**, and expressed skepticism about its efficacy compared to alternative designs. One member called yoco's setup "cursed" due to its complexity and separation from standard transformer practices.

- **Efficiency in layer ordering**: There's a significant discussion around the **ordering of attention and feed-forward layers** in models like yoco and mamba. Some argue that placing all attention layers at one end could be more efficient, reducing computational costs, while others maintain that alternating layers might ensure better overall performance.

- **Model Scaling and Performance Concerns**: Participants debated the **impact of layer ordering** on small vs. large scale models, with some suggesting that issues at small scales might be smoothed out at larger scales. A key point of contention was whether reordering layers has measurable impacts as models grow.

- **Preliminary exploration on positional embeddings**: A member posed an innovative idea regarding **pre-applying positional embeddings (PE)** to latents before computing QK, hypothesizing it could handle operations like string reversal better. This sparked curiosity and skepticism among members, who questioned if such methods would preserve or disrupt existing benefits of techniques like RoPE.

- **Reinforcement Learning Advancements**: A member shared an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19320) discussing **$\Delta$-IRIS**, a new agent employing delta-based autoencoding in RL, addressing its efficiency in training time versus traditional attention-based methods.

- **Questioning Chinchilla's Status as a Law of Nature**: A member questioned why people seem to treat **Chinchilla scaling** as an immutable law, suggesting that power law scaling can't be the final optimal scaling method. They observed that there seems to be little discussion on alternatives and speculated that serious discussions on this topic might be occurring privately.

- **Debating the Validity of Power Law Scaling**: A member argued that **power law scaling** might still be a legitimate model but acknowledged that the **Chinchilla** model's relevance is tied to specific conditions like the training regime and data. They also pondered why inverse power relations couldn't be the norm, mentioning that both inverse power and logarithmic scaling seem plausible.

- **Scaling Heuristics vs. Laws**: Another member noted that terms like "scaling law" should perhaps be replaced with "scaling heuristic" to better reflect their provisional nature. They reminisced about a time when numerous papers claimed to have discovered new "laws" better than Chinchilla, implying skepticism about such definitive language.

- **Reading and Citing Key Papers**: Members referenced several key papers to bolster their arguments, including ["Parameter Counts in Machine Learning"](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/GzoWcYibWYwJva8aL/parameter-counts-in-machine-learning) and [Adlam 2021 on Scaling Laws](https://gwern.net/doc/ai/scaling/2021-adlam.pdf). They discussed how these papers understand and model scaling laws concerning large datasets and parameter sizes.

- **Practical Limitations and Future Directions**: The conversation also touched on practical aspects like **data selection methods** and their impact on training efficiency. A member emphasized that better data collection methods, such as stratified sampling, aren't magical solutions but do improve efficiency, highlighting the complexity of predicting the future impact of data on model performance.

- **Lovely Tensors breaks with torch.compile in 2.5.0**: The author of [Lovely Tensors](https://github.com/xl0/lovely-tensors) is encountering issues with custom `Tensor.__repr__()` breaking in `torch.compile()`. This is due to their `__repr__` being called on a FakeTensor, leading to problems; a workaround involves checking if the tensor is fake.

- **Community suggests using torch.compiler APIs**: There is a suggestion to use the [torch.compiler_fine_grain_apis](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.compiler_fine_grain_apis.html) to disable or handle custom `repr` functions. This approach could potentially unblock users facing similar issues.

- **Broadcast deadlock issue with NCCL**: The [broadcast deadlock issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/issues/1251) in older NCCL versions has been a significant problem but is already fixed in newer versions not shipped with torch 2.3.1.

- **Model releases on HuggingFace Hub prioritize storage convenience**: A user noticed an increasing trend where model architecture and preprocessing code are directly stored on HuggingFace Hub instead of being added to the transformers repository. They speculated whether this is due to **code licensing issues** and shared examples [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-base-ft/tree/main) and [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Audio/tree/main).

- **Pros and Cons of HuggingFace Hub strategy**: Another user pointed out the benefits of this strategy, such as the ability for authors to release new models without needing an official HF team release, but also mentioned drawbacks like being unable to use these models for certain functionalities on the HF platform unless `trust_remote_code` is enabled.

- **Debate on optimal code and model storage solutions**: The discussion highlighted differing opinions about the best practices for storing model code and weights. One user suggested that releasing code on GitHub and storing model weights on **HuggingFace Hub** might be ideal, though others noted potential compatibility issues and the convenience factors of using the HF Hub.

- **Llama release as a case in point**: The discussion mentioned the **Llama model** release strategy, which involves maintaining the inference code on GitHub independent of the transformers library. An example repository for this approach is [meta-llama on GitHub](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama).

- **Adam-mini optimizer slashes memory usage without sacrificing performance**: An exciting new optimizer called **Adam-mini** can achieve similar or better performance than **AdamW** with 45% to 50% less memory footprint. The paper argues that most of the learning rate resources in Adam (specifically $1/\\sqrt{v}$) can be removed by partitioning parameters into blocks and assigning a single, optimized learning rate per block, ultimately outperforming Adam in some cases.

- **Single learning rates for weight tensors eliminate excess**: The innovative approach of using one pre-searched learning rate per weight tensor shows significant performance improvements over Adam. "One pre-searched learning rate per weight tensor outperforms Adam significantly," highlighting how careful resource allocation and optimization can enhance efficiency.

- **PreferenceDataset recommended for PPO implementation**: When discussing dataset configurations, a user recommended using **PreferenceDataset** for RL where *"reward model looks at how 'preferred' the whole input+response is"*. This contrasts with **text completion dataset** used for continued pretraining of single text bodies.
- **Confusion cleared up around pretraining examples**: Discussions clarified pretraining inputs and outputs, highlighting pretraining as involving whole documents where the model predicts tokens, penalizing wrong predictions, instead of handling segmented input-output pairs.
- **Option to add EOS tokens considered reasonable**: Users debated whether it makes sense to add an option for **add_eos** in the text completion dataset, concluding it is a practical idea and helped fix a PPO implementation issue.
