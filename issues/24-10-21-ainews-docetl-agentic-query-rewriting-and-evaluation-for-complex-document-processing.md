> AI News for 10/18/2024-10/21/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **32** Discords (**231** channels, and **6066** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **791 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

We usually reserve the feature story of AINews for the single biggest impactful news item of the day, but that usually results in a heavy bias towards recapping press releases from big model labs. Other stories of the year develop gradually, more of a swell than a splash, and may not be as big but are still useful as part of a well diversified diet. We use quieter days like these to shed some cumulative light on community tools like [DSPy](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-the-dspy-roadmap/) and [AI price cut stories](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-too-cheap-to-meter-ai-prices-cut-50-70-in/).

UC Berkeley has been a leader in many of the biggest waves in tech - per [David Patterson](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2013-123.pdf), the 40 year history of UCB research labs have spawned everything from RISC, RAID, and massive companies like Databricks. The latest lab in this tradition is [EPIC](https://x.com/UCBEPIC) — focused on *E*ffective *P*rogramming, *I*nteraction, and *C*omputation with Data. We were fortunate to attend [their recent conference](https://x.com/adityagp/status/1843695418338881941) and were particularly impressed by two similar papers, [LOTUS](https://x.com/lianapatel_/status/1813981153709441361) and [DocETL](https://x.com/sh_reya/status/1848415442244931861) the latter of has been [the subject of notable hype](https://x.com/sh_reya/status/1838617833393283428) and was finally [published today](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12189). Both offer some very well thought through LLM operators over large corpuses of data.

<img width="538" alt="image" src="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/00b20959-f486-4be8-82b5-c60c0cdf5baa">

<img width="1316" alt="image" src="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/997d3bcd-cefa-4476-a1f4-ee107ba5e759">

The [github docs](https://ucbepic.github.io/docetl/operators/map/) give more of idea of the proposed APIs and concepts, and at the limit this could be viewed as "just another LLM framework" similar to DSPy, but the big data focus at an institution known for successfully thinking about commercially relevant big data problems makes this one worth a closer look than the average twitter anon:

<img width="881" alt="image" src="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/312632cd-3be6-40e6-9fb5-ba87c01846d7">

At the very highest level this is just the latest front in the ongoing battle between GPU Rich Big Labs (Deepmind, OpenAI) and GPU Poor [Compound AI](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/) approaches to AI. The [DocETL demo site](https://www.docetl.org/#demo-docetl-output) helps you compare results and approaches between using their framework and "sticking it all in context". There will likely not be a clear winner here for a long time and AI Engineers will simply have to be familiar with both.

> - `Dynamic Loss Scaling in Pythia`
> - `Rotary Percent Configurations`
> - `Allgather and Reduce Bucket Sizes`
> - `BF16 and FP16 Training in Pythia Models`

- **Understanding FP16 Hysteresis**: Members discussed that **fp16:hysteresis** defines how many iterations can experience gradient overflow before the training errors out, allowing the number of hysteresis iterations to be renewable.
  
  - Reference shared included a [DeepSpeed pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/pull/3553) explaining the consecutive hysteresis feature.
- **Dynamic Loss Scaling and Pythia**: It was confirmed that **Pythia** models allowed skipping weight updates during FP16 runs if there were NaN or Inf gradients, whereas BF16 runs did not allow this.
  
  - A member highlighted that if a gradient is Inf or NaN in BF16 runs, the training setup just errors out.
- **Rotary Percent Configuration Discrepancy**: Members questioned why **rotary_pct** was set to 0.25 in some configurations despite the default being 1, making comparisons between different model configurations.
  
  - Discussion noted that this setting's impact on convergence likely led to its choice, though exact rationale remained unclear.
- **Setting Bucket Sizes for Communication Efficiency**: Efficient communication strategies were discussed, emphasizing that larger **allgather** and **reduce bucket sizes** improve communication efficiency due to network hardware optimization for larger messages.
  
  - The ideal bucket size aims to balance bandwidth saturation and computational overlap, as detailed in an [EleutherAI cookbook](https://github.com/EleutherAI/cookbook/tree/main/benchmarks/communication).
- **BF16 and FP16 Training Configurations**: Clarification was sought regarding whether Pythia models were trained solely in FP16 or if BF16 runs were also utilized, leading to the discovery that the 1B deduped model is indeed configured incorrectly in the HF library.
  
  - A member mentioned plans to correct the auto-populated HF config value to accurately reflect the training setup.
