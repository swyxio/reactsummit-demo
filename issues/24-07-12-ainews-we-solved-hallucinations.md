<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**With one weird trick!**

> AI News for 7/11/2024-7/12/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**463** channels, and **2566** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **276 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Look, we've known for a while that our Reddit summaries are ridden with... erm... links that don't go where they claim to go. You keep reminding us! (Thanks!)

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/90d8843b-3834-46ed-85c5-56bf51f2c441.png?w=960&fit=max) 

The reason that this happens specifically to our Reddit summaries much much more than our Discord or Twitter recaps is because of Reddit's URL structure.

Here is a typical Reddit URL:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cxnrov/disappointing_if_true_meta_plans_to_not_open_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cxnrov/disappointing_if_true_meta_plans_to_not_open_the/)

The slug at the end (`disappointing_if_true_meta_plans_to_not_open_the`) is just an attempt to make a human readable slug out of the title, AND the subreddit at the start (`r/LocalLLaMA`) is also just for human readability. In practice, all of it is ignored in favor of the *real* slug, that 7 character alphanumeric set (`1cxnrov`). Here, we'll prove it:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SmolAI/comments/1cxnrov/ainews_is_the_best/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmolAI/comments/1cxnrov/ainews_is_the_best/)

Despite having changed the subreddit and the human slug, Reddit sends you to the same post as before based on the *real* slug.

So Reddit URLs, much more than most URLs, are *hyper*, hyper sensitive to small mistakes in attention, even if all we are asking the LLM to do is copy from a source docment with the reference link neatly spelled out.

And... both Claude and GPT4 are trained on an awful lot of NSFW Reddit URLs ([in multiple languages](https://x.com/tianle_cai/status/1790109646205890723)!). Put these two facts together and you can see what we've been dealing with.

So.. [we went ahead and fixed the glitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUE0PPQI3is), *while* still using LLMs to format, select, and summarize across a full corpus of Reddit submissions and comments. Tweet [@Smol_AI](https://x.com/Smol_AI) if you have guesses on how we do it.

It's been another content light day, so please enjoy our conversation with Clementine Fourrier on LLM Evals (our [coverage in May](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-to-be-named-4285/) and the future of the Open LLM Leaderboard:

> - `Indexing Kernel in tinygrad`
> - `PyTorch 2024 H2 Roadmaps` 


- **Indexing Kernel Introduced in tinygrad**: George Hotz introduced an [indexing kernel](https://x.com/__tinygrad__/status/1811578147982491938), which wouldn't normally be allowed in tinygrad due to an upstream LOAD of a LOAD.
   - He explained that it's all generated in the backend by folding the sum loop, creating a strict subset of the 'planned' memory accesses.
- **Proposal to Create PyTorch-like Roadmaps**: A member suggested creating roadmaps similar to the [2024 H2 plans by the PyTorch Team](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/meta-pytorch-team-2024-h2-roadmaps/2226).
   - *We should make similar roadmaps* was the key takeaway, emphasizing the benefits of having clear development pathways.

- **Defining Custom Weight and Bias in Network Succeeds**: A user showed successful implementation of defining custom weight and bias in a network, resulting in the expected graph output.
   - They expressed satisfaction, stating: *love this... thanks for the help*.
- **Implementing Gradient Descent Highlights Challenges**: A user attempted to implement gradient descent from scratch in tinygrad but found it extremely slow and unclear without `optimizer.step`.
   - They shared [code snippets](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/988aa59e4d8fefa526d06f3b453ad116258398d4/names.txt) and sought advice on how to make the computation efficient.
- **Manually Realizing Tensors for Gradient Descent**: George Hotz suggested the use of `model.weights.assign(model.weights - lr * model.weights.grad).realize()` to manually realize tensor computations during gradient descent.
   - He emphasized that *you need the realize if you want the compute to happen*.
- **Debugging Slowness in Gradient Descent Steps**: The performance issues were identified as being due to tensor indexing during loss computation, especially with large datasets.
   - The `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` implementation using masking was suggested as a faster alternative.
- **Tensor Indexing Bugs Impact Kernel Performance**: A suggestion to use `-probas[:, Y_train]` for better performance led to an assertion error regarding the maximum index size.
   - This was identified as a bug since the expression resulted in **idx.max too big** errors.

> - `GaLore and Q-Galore`
> - `Dataset Shuffling` 


- **Q-Galore improves on GaLore with efficiency**: GaLore reduces memory usage by projecting weight gradients into a low-rank subspace, but it relies on time-consuming SVD operations and gives minimal improvements compared to LoRA in fine-tuning scenarios. [Q-Galore](https://huggingface.co/papers/2407.08296) addresses these issues by combining quantization and low-rank projection, substantially reducing memory usage and training time.
   - *Q-Galore*'s novel method surpasses the benefits of GaLore by observing that some gradient subspaces converge early while others change frequently.
- **Dataset shuffling occurs between epochs**: A member raised a historical dev question about why there is no explicit support for shuffling a single dataset prior to training.
   - Another member clarified that **batches are shuffled between epochs**, and the original poster acknowledged the clarification, mentioning they did not read that section.

- **Introducing LLM Arena for Enhanced Dataset Quality**: An **LLM arena** has been created to pit two language models against each other with a third one acting as a judge, primarily using models from **Ollama** but compatible with any **OpenAI** endpoint.
   - This setup aims to **increase dataset quality** by leveraging competitive benchmarks, as seen on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/syv-ai/OpenArena).
- **Inspired by the WizardLM Paper**: **OpenArena** is based on the [WizardLM paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/arena-learning-build-data-flywheel-for-llms-post-training-via-simulated-chatbot-arena/) which proposes the **Arena Learning** method to build an efficient data flywheel for LLMs post-training.
   - This involves simulating iterative arena battles and leveraging **AI-annotated results** to enhance models in supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
