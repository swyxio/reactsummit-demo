As Eugene Cheah remarked in the Latent Space Discord, this is the third team (after [Jamba]( https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-jamba-mixture-of-architectures-dethrones/) and [Zamba](https://x.com/QuentinAnthon15/status/1780280071304937978) that has independently found the result that mixing Mamba and Transformer blocks does better than either can alone. And the paper does conclude empirically that the optimal amount of Attention is <20%, being FAR from all you need.

- **Rank boosts give better training results**: "I can confirm that the issues with Qwen2-1.5b training and it outputting gibberish is to do with too low of a rank. I switched from rank 16 to rank 128, and my outputs matched the quality of my outputs from my llama-3 train."
- **scGPT might not be practical outside academia**: "That's a custom transformer implemented in torch 😅 Unusable outside academia as is...interesting what they did on the prompting and the tokenizer!"
- **Inference support and memory efficiency in Unsloth**: A user asked if Unsloth affects inference and received confirmation that Unsloth reduces memory usage significantly during both training and inference.
- **Mixture of Agents (MoA) does not impress**: Users discussed Together AI’s [MoA](https://www.together.ai/blog/together-moa) approach to layering LLM agents but found it "kind of just for show" and overly complex.
- **Dockerizing for seamless pipelines**: "The notebooks are a great 'jump in' but in real-world apps you want to integrate that with other stuff. Making CLI tools for consistent workflows and easier integrations with frameworks like ZenML."

- **Untrained Tokens Error**: Another user encountered a `ValueError` related to untrained tokens while training a model, suggesting that `embed_tokens` and `lm_head` must be included in the training process. This issue was linked to adding new tokens that require enabling training on certain model parts.

- **Dataset Formatting for Multilabel Classification**: One member sought advice on finetuning Llama 3 for multilabel classification and whether the same prompt format could be used. While responses acknowledged the need for consistent dataset templates, no specific solution for multilabel classification was provided.

- **Struggles with Speed-Up on 4090**: Despite setting influential flags and using multiple approaches like `torch.matmul` and `torch.nn.functional.linear`, a member couldn't achieve a good speed-up on an RTX 4090 GPU during INT8 and FP16 mixed matrix multiplications. They experimented with various configurations and observed slower performance.
  
- **FP8 and INT8 Matrix Multiplication**: Discussions revealed that FP8 x FP8 matmuls resulted in slower operations compared to INT8, due to slow casting processes. INT8 quantization seems to provide better speed and accuracy and is supported even on older GPUs like Pascal.
  
- **INT6 Quantization Shows Promise**: INT6, using a group size of 64, showed minimal accuracy degradation in tests with Llama3-8B-instruct models. Members noted that INT6 and INT4 quantizations have promising performance but require careful handling to maintain accuracy.

- **Exploring Mixed Precision with FP16/FP8**: Mixed precision operation FP16 x FP8 was discussed, highlighting the potential benefits and existing support in Microsoft's BitBLAS. Implementation and integration challenges were mentioned, particularly with the necessity to compile TVM.

- **Microsoft BitBLAS Implementation**: BitBLAS supports mixed precision matrix multiplications such as FP16 x FP8E4M3, but it relies heavily on TVM's Python interface. This requirement complicates the integration with other libraries, making it less accessible for some projects.
