<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 2/29/2024-3/1/2024. We checked [**356** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **22** Discords (**351** channels, and **6023** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **577 minutes**.

The most extreme form of Quantization is Binarization - chopping off all but 1 bit of the weights. TheBloke currently cuts it down to 4 bits but the loss in performance is dramatic. Usually.

[The Era of 1-bit LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764) paper has been catching quite some attention on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39535800) and the Discords. The abstract is worth parsing carefully (with commentary from swyx):

- **Recent research, such as BitNet, is paving the way for a new era of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs).** (the [BitNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453) shows how to use a binary BitLinear function as a drop-in replacement of conventional matrix multiplication in order to train 1-bit weights from scratch with 38x energy cost reduction and competitive performance)
- In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58, in which **every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}**. 
- It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being **significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption**. 
- More profoundly, **the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective**. Furthermore, it enables a new computation paradigm and opens the door for designing specific hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs.

We would normally do a fuller parse of the paper but have to go do this dylan patel show. More in Latent Space's writeup this weekend.
