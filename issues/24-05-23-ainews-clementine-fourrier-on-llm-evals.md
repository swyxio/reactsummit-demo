description: >-
  **Clémentine Fourrier** from **Huggingface** presented at **ICLR** about
  **GAIA** with **Meta** and shared insights on **LLM evaluation** methods. The
  blog outlines three main evaluation approaches: **Automated Benchmarking**
  using sample inputs/outputs and metrics, **Human Judges** involving grading
  and ranking with methods like **Vibe-checks**, **Arena**, and **systematic
  annotations**, and **Models as Judges** using generalist or specialist models
  with noted biases. Challenges include data contamination, subjectivity, and
  bias in scoring. These evaluations help prevent regressions, rank models, and
  track progress in the field.

> Special addendum for the [AI Engineer World's Fair](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-the-top-ai-engineer/) callout yesterday - [Scholarships are available for those who cannot afford full tickets!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdVf9reEpVyzw_sb9cAOtzxORGTEskcb5PTX2X-GPZ_onUtHw/viewform). More speaker announcements are [rolling out](https://x.com/aidotengineer).

Many people know [Huggingface's Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard), but you rarely hear from the people behind it. [Clémentine Fourrier made a rare appearance at ICLR](https://x.com/clefourrier/status/1793301496102068339?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email) (to co-present [GAIA with Meta](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12983), something we cover on the upcoming ICLR pod) and is now back with [a blog covering how she thinks about LLM Evals](https://huggingface.co/blog/clefourrier/llm-evaluation).

This is not going to be groundbreaking for those very close to the problem, but is a good and accessible "state of the art" summary from one of the most credible people in the field.

Our TL;DR: There are 3 main ways to do evals:

- **Automated Benchmarking**
  - Evals are made of **a collection of sample input/outputs** (usually comparing generated text with a reference or multiple choice) and a **metric** (to compute a score for a model)
  - for a specific **task**
    - Works well for very well-defined tasks
    - Common problems: models [favoring specific choices based on the order in which they have been presented for multi-choice evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03882), and generative evaluations relying on normalisations which can easily be [unfair if not designed well](https://huggingface.co/blog/open-llm-leaderboard-drop) 
  - or for a general **capability**
    - e.g. GSM8K high school problems as a proxy for "good at math", [unicorns](https://twitter.com/DimitrisPapail/status/1719119242186871275) for "can draw"
  - LLMs scores on automated benchmarks are extremely susceptible to [minute changes in prompting](https://huggingface.co/blog/evaluation-structured-outputs)
  - Biggest problem: data contamination. BigBench tried adding a "canary string" but compliance/awareness is poor. [Tools exist to detect contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06233) and peopel are exploring [dynamic benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14337) though this is costly.
- **Humans as Judges**
  - Done by tasking humans with 1) prompting models and 2) **grading a model answer or ranking several outputs according to guidelines**. 
  - more flexibility than automated metrics. 
  - prevents most contamination cases, 
  - correlates well with human preference
  - Either as **Vibe-checks**
    - mostly constitute anecdotal evidence, and tend to be highly sensitive to confirmation bias
    - but some people like [Ravenwolf are very systematic](https://huggingface.co/blog/wolfram/llm-comparison-test-llama-3)
  - Or as **Arena** (e.g. [LMsys](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard))
    - Votes are then aggregated in an Elo ranking (a ranking of matches) to select which model is "the best". 
    - high subjectivity: hard to enforce a consistent grading from many community members using broad guidelines
  - Or as **systematic annotations**
    - provide extremely specific guidelines to paid selected annotators, in order to remove as much as the subjectivity bias as possible (Scale AI and other annotation companies)
    - still expensive
    - can still fall prey to human bias
- **Models as Judges**
  - using generalist, high capability models
  - OR using small specialist models trained specifically to discriminate from preference data
  - Limitations: 
    - tend to [favor their own outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13076) when scoring answers
    - bad at [providing consistent score ranges](https://twitter.com/aparnadhinak/status/1748368364395721128)
    - not that [consistent with human rankings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15812)
  - Introduce very subtle and un-interpretable bias in the answer selection

Evals are used to prevent regressions, and to rank models, and to serve as a proxy for progress in the field.

- **Complimentary GPU Optimization Event**: Filippob82 announced a workshop on GPU optimization featuring speakers from OpenAI, NVIDIA, Meta, and Voltron Data. The event will be livestreamed on YouTube and discussed on [Discord](https://discord.gg/T5sx2MYd5R), with more details in the [README](https://github.com/mlops-discord/gpu-optimization-workshop) and [workshop note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TR_5Ax0rPqTj8I2sA7MH-aa4J7TUUt4Ji9272OP8ZJg/edit).

- **Training Tips on A100s and H100s**: Stevenmerrill inquired about general rules for training on A100 and H100 GPUs, with Tddammo recommending to absolutely use bf16 if the GPU supports it and adjust batch sizes to utilize available VRAM. Additionally, sequence lengths can also be increased due to enhanced memory capacity.

- **VRAM Calculation Challenges**: Remek1972 discussed issues with VRAM requirements for larger sequence lengths (e.g., 4096 tokens) on an A6000 GPU, finding that it leads to crashes. The conversation concluded that using mixed precision (bf16) and optimization strategies could mitigate some memory issues but larger models might necessitate offloading or quantization.

- **Paged ADAMW 8-bit Optimizer Discussion**: Lhl mentioned using the paged_adamw_8bit optimizer for efficiency and asked about any potential drawbacks, receiving assurance that performance is equivalent to normal adam. They discussed the community's experience and findings, including the benefits of 8-bit optimization for memory usage.

- **Interest in Latest Optimizers**: Lhl and Tddammo discussed experimenting with new optimizers like Sophia and Adam_LoMo. Recommendations and shared experiences pointed to potential benefits in performance, with Lhl adding links to recent discussions on Twitter regarding new optimizer benchmarks.
