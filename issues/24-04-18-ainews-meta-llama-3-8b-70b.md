- **Mistral Tokenization Shared**: Mistral has released their tokenization library with hopes it will be adopted by all inference libraries, aiming for a standardized format for finetuning across various models. The library features Tool Calls and structured output, and is available in a [Jupyter Notebook example](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-common/blob/main/examples/tokenizer.ipynb).

- **Meta Unveils Llama 3**: Meta's new *Llama 3* model has been announced, set to be accessible across numerous platforms including AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure with the promise of improved multilingual performance due to a tokenizer with a vocabulary of 128K tokens. The announcement, details, and expected ecosystem support can be found on the [Meta AI Blog](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/).

- **Llama 3's Multilingual Support in Question**: Despite the efficiency of Llama 3's tokenizer, there is a note of caution about its multilingual performance, stating that, while over 30 languages are covered, performance in non-English languages may not be on par with English. The presence of high-quality non-English data in over 5% of the pretraining dataset is acknowledged but performance expectations are tempered.

- **Tokenizers Attract Developer Focus**: In the wake of Llama 3's release, community members are discussing the availability and access to the new tokenizer, with reports of access via Hugging Face being granted almost instantly. Concerns have arisen around whether this tokenizer could be downscaled for particular languages like Czech to facilitate faster inference.

- **Restrictions on Llama 3 Output Stir Concerns**: Llama 3's release has prompted feedback from the community regarding the downstream usage restrictions placed on model output, with some expressing disappointment on Twitter and advocating for fewer restraints to support open source development. The tweet highlights an ongoing preference for alternatives like MistralAI that offer fewer restrictions.
