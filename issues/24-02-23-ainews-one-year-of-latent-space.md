- **In Quest for Model Hybridization**: `@jsarnecki` is considering a "frankenmerge" of **Orca-2-13b** with **Nous-Hermes-2-DPO-7b**, using Orca as the base and merging layer by layer to a 17B parameter model using [mergekit](https://github.com/arcee-ai/mergekit). However, `@maldevide` clarifies that such models are non-homologous and therefore not directly mergeable.
- **Mix-and-Match Model Merging Madness**: `@maldevide` suggests that, while direct merging is impossible, using datasets [fine-tuned on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca) could be beneficial and references the complex merging techniques used in creating [SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/upstage/SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0). They mention "SFT to clean things up" after a layered merge.
- **Homomorphic Hassles and Merging Methods**: `@alphaatlas1` and `@maldevide` discuss that for non-homologous merges like `@jsarnecki`'s project, serious issues arise with no established techniques for such merges, and recommend a homomorphic projection matrix with intensive training.
- **Curiosity Sparked by PEFT and Merge Approaches**: `@alphaatlas1` points to [a blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/peft_merging) revealing PEFT's findings on model merges and notes DARE ties merging's adverse results on diffusion models, while it seems more suitable for LLMs according to tests in [meh on GitHub](https://github.com/s1dlx/meh).
- **Diffusion Model Merge Dilemmas**: The conversation shifts to the peculiar behavior of diffusion models with merging techniques, with `@jsarnecki` and `@alphaatlas1` noting the potential impact due to the models' density and alignment, while linear merges work well for models like SD (Stable Diffusion).

- **AMD GPUs Lack Support for FA2**: `@mrrational` and `@iron_bound` both reported issues running FA2 training on their AMD GPUs, specifically the 7900xtx, even with the triton version for `@iron_bound`. The backward function/kernel appears to be missing, causing failures.

- **Potential Solution for Backward Function**: `@_t_vi_` suggested using [Triton-autodiff on GitHub](https://github.com/srush/triton-autodiff) to help `@iron_bound` get the backward kernel for FA2 training on an AMD GPU; however, `@srush1301` clarified it would still require adjustments as it mainly differentiates mathematical functions.

- **Limited AMD PyTorch Support for FAv2**: `@drisspg` informed the channel that AMD has added some limited FAv2 support in PyTorch's nightly builds, but `@iron_bound`'s subsequent error message indicates that the 7900xtx GPU isn't supported yet, as it's expecting gpu architecture gfx90a and not gfx11.

- **Further Clarification on GPU Architecture**: `@iron_bound` explained the architectural differences between the AMD GPUs, noting that the 7900 series targets "wave32" while data-center cards support "wave64." He also mentioned that AMD developers are currently focused on their mi300 product, signaling that lower-priority support issues may not be addressed promptly.

- **Exploring Code for Having Wave Matrix Multiplication (WMMA)**: `@iron_bound` shared a goal to potentially create a kernel targeting WMMA by referencing the code [from the flash-attention GitHub repository](https://github.com/ROCm/flash-attention/blob/b28f18350af92a68bec057875fd486f728c9f084/csrc/flash_attn_rocm/src/device_gemm_trait.hpp#L42), as RDNA architecture supports WMMA in contrast to data-center cards that use XDL.
