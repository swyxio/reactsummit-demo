- **Adam-mini aims to optimize memory usage**: A member shared an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16793) proposing Adam-mini, an optimizer that achieves performance on-par or better than AdamW with 45% to 50% less memory footprint. The optimizer reduces memory by cutting down the number of learning rates in Adam, using a single learning rate for parameter blocks inspired by the Hessian structure of Transformers.
- **Inquiring about masking output texts during training**: A member asked if there's a way to mask out certain 'output' texts, similar to `train_on_input`, suggesting a potential feature like `do_not_train_on_output_marked_as_masked`.
- **Debate on gradient accumulation impact on training time**: Multiple members discussed whether increasing gradient accumulation (GA) times, e.g., accumulating gradients 100 times, would affect the overall training time per epoch. One member suggested it might be faster as the optimizer runs fewer times, potentially reducing noise absorbed by parameters, while another argued that high GA slows down per step performance.
- **Issue with CUDA errors during training**: A member shared an error related to CUDA illegal memory access encountered during training, suggesting debugging steps like using `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` or compiling with `TORCH_USE_CUDA_DSA` to enable device-side assertions.
