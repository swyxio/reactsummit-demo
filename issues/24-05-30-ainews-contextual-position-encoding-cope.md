<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Just one more RoPE variant bro just one more**

> AI News for 5/29/2024-5/30/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**391** channels, and **4383** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **478 minutes**.

A quiet day, but the CoPE paper got some buzz: so we're talking about it. 

Traditional LLMs have [known issues with simple algorithmic tasks like counting and copying](https://x.com/pfau/status/1796273583603302823). This is likely an artefact of their positional encoding strategy.

Jason Weston of Meta AI released his [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18719) on [CoPE](https://x.com/jaseweston/status/1795978611784089799), a new positional encoding method for transformers that takes into account *context*,  creating "gates" with learnable indices.

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ad0fb3fc-e851-46c7-8f03-6d9ae4f24043.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Using this, a CoPE LLM can:

- "count" distances per head dependent on need, e.g. i-th sentence or paragraph, words, verbs, etc. Not just tokens.
- solve [counting & copy tasks](https://x.com/jaseweston/status/1795978614132920656/photo/1) that standard transformers cannot.  ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/d765bdf5-9ceb-4d1f-a7be-6eb4e2c214c9.png?w=960&fit=max) 
- Better PPL on language modeling + coding tasks.
 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/7c43c0a4-767d-4ea0-a687-f1ad52252cb0.png?w=960&fit=max) 

**You could even modify this concept to use [external memory](https://x.com/krishnanrohit/status/1796061792201814466), not merely local context, to calculate the gates.**

As [Lucas Beyer notes](https://x.com/giffmana/status/1796077219455869414), the raft of position encoding variants this year is perhaps a richer source of research because "Linear attention was about removing capacity from the model, which didn’t make sense long term. Position embedding is about **adding missing capabilities to the model**, which makes a lot more sense."

- **Finetuning for dialect recognition**: Discussing the best approach to make an LLM understand and distinguish between different Fenni-Swedish dialects. The suggestion is to finetune using a model that knows Swedish and to tag each dialect, potentially treating them as separate languages.

- **Debugging the model and finetuning with Axolotl**: A user seeks advice on debugging a model and confirms the chat template's functionality. They mention trying to fine-tune the Qwen model but face issues with training starting and then stopping, sharing their [notebook](#).

- **Scalability in natural language to SQL**: A user discusses the challenge of generating accurate SQL queries from natural language for a vast number of tables. They seek effective methods to filter relevant tables and add knowledge to the LLM, sharing their current approach and issues with overfitting and hallucinations during finetuning.

- **Using knowledge graphs for table relations**: Suggestion to build a knowledge graph on table relations and use it to identify the relevant tables for query generation. This approach can help filter the tables and provide necessary context for the LLM.

- **Fine-Tuning Reduces Hallucinations with Clean Data**: Fine-tuning to reduce hallucinations is effective when using clean training data, as highlighted in this [tweet thread](https://x.com/stefanhgm/status/1765466556216053879). However, [research shows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05904) that fine-tuning with new knowledge can increase hallucinations, especially in tasks like closed-book QA.

- **Streamlining Eval Processes for LLMs**: Discussions emphasized enhancing eval processes for tasks like Text-to-SQL using L1 (unit tests and assertions for syntax) and L2 (human feedback for relevance). Leveraging execution results and fuzzy searches based on schema can validate correctness, and performance evaluations require more nuanced checks.

- **Eval Libraries for LLM Scoring**: Recommendations for scoring LLM evaluations include [Hugging Face's Evaluate library](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/en/index) and Braintrust's [Autoevals](https://github.com/braintrustdata/autoevals), which offer various evaluation methods for NLP, AI models, and more. These tools aim to streamline the process with best practices and reproducibility.

- **Mojo's `^` operator and `bit_not` usage explained**: A user inquired if the `^` operator in Mojo was the same as in C and for `bit_not`. Another user clarified that `bit_not` is `~val` and XOR operation is `x ^ y`, while the transfer operator follows a value, like `val^`.

- **Debugging XOR operations between C and Mojo**: A member was comparing C and Mojo code involving shifts and XOR and found disagreement. Upon checking, they realized that the issue was due to printing the wrong variable in the C code, and now both codes agree.

- **`for` loops and iterators in Mojo**: A user asked how `for` loops are terminated in Mojo compared to Python's `StopIteration` and confirmed that `for` loops invoke the `__iter__` method resulting in an iterator.

- **Mojo vs Python comparison questioned**: A member expressed skepticism about Santiago's performance comparison on binary search between Mojo and Python, noting that calling the Python interface 100,000 times is not a fair comparison. The member was surprised to see Modular retweeting the post despite questionable benchmarking methods, as shown in [this tweet](https://x.com/svpino/status/1795811741538099685).

- **Transparency and flawed benchmarks**: Another member acknowledged that while the benchmark may not be good, Santiago is transparent about his methods. They hinted at a relaxed attitude with a shrugging emoji.

- **Repository for compiler benchmarks shared**: A cool [repository](https://github.com/nordlow/compiler-benchmark) was shared that compares the compilation speeds of different programming languages and compilers, though it does not consider caching.

### **Modular (Mojo 🔥) ▷ #[nightly](https://discord.com/channels/1087530497313357884/1224434323193594059/1245458528437801073)** (22 messages🔥): 

- **Mojo Nightly Release Update**: A new Mojo nightly build `2024.5.3005` has been released. The update includes critical changes like removal of `Stringable` constructor from `String`, and removal of several `math` functions, among others. [Raw diff](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/compare/fadceb1d7612bd0499f7280554f8ea5d774fcdef...8ae83916ebc7b3134948f466c0f56ee3e5569062) and [current changelog](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/nightly/docs/changelog.md) are provided.

- **Nightly versus Released Builds**: An official from Mojo stated that currently, ~25% of Mojo installs are from nightly builds. This decision is to maintain simplicity for less experienced users who might get confused if they land on the wrong branch.

- **Stringable Constructor Removal Impact**: Users reported errors due to the removal of the `Stringable` constructor from `String`. The solution suggested was to use `str` instead.

- **CI Fix for Public Mojo Repo**: The Continuous Integration (CI) for the public Mojo repo has been fixed. The regression was due to changes in `String.strip()` and was resolved in [GitHub Pull Request #2883](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2883).

- **Behavior of `__setitem__` with List Capacity**: Users discussed that using `__setitem__` with a list's `capacity` does not update the list's length. Instead, it is recommended to use `append` to add elements to the list.

**Link mentioned**: <a href="https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2883.">Build software better, together</a>: GitHub is where people build software. More than 100 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 420 million projects.

- **Tinygrad handles integer gradients easily**: A member pointed out that **Torch** does not allow integer variables to have gradients, leading to errors like `RuntimeError: Only Tensors of floating point and complex dtype can require gradients`. In **Tinygrad**, the same code can compute the gradient of integers without issue.
- **Behavior related to integer backpropagation**: Another member stated that **Tinygrad** computes as if the tensor is a float and then casts it to the original dtype. This differentiates Tinygrad from other frameworks.
- **Tinygrad superiority claim**: A member enthusiastically claimed that **Tinygrad** is better than **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**, valuing it the most. However, this sparked a query about the reasons behind TensorFlow being considered better than PyTorch.
