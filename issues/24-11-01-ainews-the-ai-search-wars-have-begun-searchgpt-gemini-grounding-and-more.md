description: >-
  **ChatGPT** launched its search functionality across all platforms using a
  fine-tuned version of **GPT-4o** with synthetic data generation and
  distillation from **o1-preview**. This feature includes a Chrome extension
  promoted by **Sam Altman** but has issues with hallucinations. The launch
  coincides with **Gemini** introducing Search Grounding after delays. Notably,
  **The New York Times** is not a partner due to a lawsuit against **OpenAI**.
  The AI search competition intensifies with consumer and B2B players like
  **Perplexity** and **Glean**. Additionally, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** achieved a
  new benchmark record on SWE-bench Verified, and a new hallucination evaluation
  benchmark, SimpleQA, was introduced. Other highlights include the
  **Universal-2** speech-to-text model with 660M parameters and **HOVER**, a
  neural whole-body controller for humanoid robots trained in NVIDIA Isaac
  simulation. AI hedge fund teams using **LangChain** and **LangGraph** were
  also showcased. The news is sponsored by the RAG++ course featuring experts
  from **Weights & Biases**, **Cohere**, and **Weaviate**.

We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **32** Discords (**231** channels, and **2468** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **264 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Teased as [SearchGPT in July](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SearchGPT), ChatGPT finally rolled out its search functionality today across all platforms, [completely coincidentally](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-gemini-pro-and-gpt4t-vision-go-ga-on-the/) coinciding with [Gemini launching Search Grounding](https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1852032947714510860) after [an unfortunate delay]( https://x.com/apples_jimmy/status/1852063620240413103?s=46).  The launch includes [a simple Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-search/ejcfepkfckglbgocfkanmcdngdijcgld?pli=1) that @sama is personally promoting on Twitter and on [their Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ggixzy/ama_with_openais_sam_altman_kevin_weil_srinivas/) (dont bother) today:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/70cf4921-bb33-4e08-b5dd-dea708482bbf.png?w=960&fit=max)

with a raft of weather, stocks, sports, news, and maps partners — noticeably, you will never get a New York Times article via ChatGPT because [the NYT chose to sue OpenAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/08/openai-responds-to-new-york-times-lawsuit.html) instead of partner with them. Partners are presumably happy about the feature, but the citations come with a catch - you have to expend an additional click to see them at all, and most will not.

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6c1cbefa-f526-4e2d-9578-6ac2f4d5883c.png?w=960&fit=max)

CHatGPT search uses a "*fine-tuned version of GPT-4o, post-trained using novel synthetic data generation techniques, including distilling outputs from OpenAI o1-preview*", however it is already found to [offer hallucinations](https://x.com/altryne/status/1852045015050260703).

This latest salvo in consumer AI plays challenging their search leader (Perplexity) mirrors a broader trend in b2b AI  plays ([Dropbox Dash](https://x.com/FanaHOVA/status/1847316954077684021)) challenging their search leader (Glean).

Sounds like a good time to bone up on AI search techniques, with today's AINews sponsor!

> - `C-style macros vs decorators`
> - `SQL query validation`
> - `Custom string interpolators`
> - `Static MLIR reflection`
> - `Algebraic types`

- **Debate over C-style macros vs custom decorators**: There’s a consensus that introducing **C-style macros** may bring more confusion than benefits, as highlighted by multiple members in the discussion.
  
  - Plans for **custom decorator capabilities** and the importance of keeping Mojo simpler were suggested as preferable alternatives.
- **SQL query validation through decorators**: Members discussed the potential for **SQL query verification** at compile time using decorators, though concerns were raised about the feasibility of such features.
  
  - It was noted that **specific DB schema validation** might still require additional handling beyond what decorators can provide.
- **Potential of custom string interpolators**: **Custom string interpolators**, similar to those in Scala, could lead to more efficient syntax checks for SQL strings in Mojo, according to community input.
  
  - Members emphasized that implementing this feature could avoid the complexity associated with traditional syntactic macros.
- **Static MLIR reflection vs macros**: Discussion emerged around the advantages of **static MLIR reflection** compared to traditional macros, with the former providing significant type manipulation capabilities.
  
  - It was noted that while static reflection can replace some macro functionalities, maintaining simplicity is crucial to avoid issues with language server protocols.
- **Concerns over syntax merging in Mojo**: Concerns were raised about the potential **messiness** of syntax if `match` could be implemented without compiler support, underscoring the need for clean syntax.
  
  - It was suggested that Mojo might follow Python's lead with a `match/case` structure, yet compiler backing is essential for optimal implementation.
