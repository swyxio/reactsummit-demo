> AI News for 11/21/2024-11/22/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**217** channels, and **2501** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **237 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Frontier lab race dynamics are getting somewhat ridiculous. We used to have a rule that new SOTA models always get top spot, and [reported on Gemini Exp 1114 last week](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-gemini-experimental-1114-retakes-1-llm-9071/) even though there was next to no useful detail on it beyond their lmsys ranking. But yesterday OpenAI overtook them again with [gpt-4o-2024-11-20](https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1859307979184689269), which we fortunately didn't report on (thanks to DeepSeek R1), because it is now [suspected of being a worse (but faster) model](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1859614633654616310) (we don't know if this is true but it would be a very serious accusation indeed for OpenAI to effectively brand a "mini" model as a mainline model and hope we don't notice), and meanwhile, today [Gemini Exp 1121](https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1859673146837827623) is out -again- retaking the top lmsys spot from OpenAI.

It's getting so absurd that [this joke](https://x.com/adonis_singh/status/1859682100569571399) playing on [OpenAI-vs-Gemini-release-coincidences](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-the-ai-search-wars-have-begun-searchgpt/) is somewhat plausible:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1f200ce6-01cb-4ebf-b385-14cb782c8c52.png?w=960&fit=max)

The complete suspension of all model release decorum is always justifiable under innocent "we just wanted to get these out into the hands of devs ASAP" type good intentions,  but we are now in a situation where all three frontier labs (reminder that Anthropic, despite [their snark](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1859676984768688231?s=46
), has also been [playing the date-update-with-no-versioning game](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-claude-35-sonnet-new-gets-computer-use/)) have SOTA model variants uniquely only identified by their dates rather than their versions, in order to keep up on Lmsys.

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/5faaf02f-bfad-471c-b6ae-8eb644203293.png?w=960&fit=max)

Are we just not doing versioning anymore? Hopefully we are, because we're still talking about o2 and gpt5 and claude4 and gemini2, but this liminal lull as the [100k clusters](https://x.com/ServeTheHome/status/1850917031421399543) ramp up is a rather local minima nobody is truly happy with.

> - `Scaling Laws`
> - `Evaluation Predictions`
> - `Marius Hobbhahn's Contributions`
> - `Meta and OpenAI's Methods`
> - `Cost of Scaling Law Training` 


- **Scaling Laws Explained**: A recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10938) discusses how language model performance varies with scale and offers an observational approach using ~100 publicly available models to develop scaling laws without direct training.
   - This method can highlight variations in training efficiency, proposing a generalized scaling law where performance is dependent on a low-dimensional capability space.
- **Marius Hobbhahn Leads Eval Science**: Marius Hobbhahn at Apollo is noted for publicly advocating for the science of evaluation methodologies in the field of scaling laws.
   - His contributions aim to ground predictions and benchmarking in observable metrics rather than extensive modeling.
- **Predicting Performance Before Training**: The GPT-4 paper predicted its score in the popular HumanEval coding benchmark within a ~1% margin prior to even training, illustrating effective evaluation methodologies.
   - Similarly, the Meta team predicted the Llama-3.1 model's performance on the Abstract Reasoning Corpus before training, employing innovative statistical methods.
- **Methods for Successful Predictions**: The prediction methodology for HumanEval involved plotting Mean Log Pass rate against compute scales, while the Abstract Reasoning Corpus utilized a two-step translation involving negative log likelihood.
   - These methods demonstrated the ability to accurately project model capabilities based on scaling laws derived from existing models.
- **The Cost of Scaling Law Models**: Training scaling law models is costly but significantly less than training full target models, with Meta reportedly spending only 0.1% to 1% of the target model's budget.
   - For instance, to predict capabilities for a $1B model, the cost of training the scaling law models could exceed $1M if following this budget ratio.

> - `Moonshine ASR Model Performance`
> - `Mojo Script Optimization`
> - `CPU Utilization Observations` 


- **Moonshine ASR Model shows speed challenges**: The **Moonshine ASR model** was tested using both Mojo and Python versions via Max, yielding an execution time of **82ms** for **10s** of speech, while a direct ONNX version managed **46ms**.
   - This indicates a **1.8x slowdown** in the Mojo and Python versions compared to the more optimized ONNX runtime.
- **Mojo script experiences crashes**: When writing the **Mojo version**, there were issues with **Model.execute** causing crashes when passing `TensorMap`, and a manual argument listing was necessary due to the lack of unpacking support.
   - These hurdles highlight the script's unidiomatic nature and the author's desire for performance tips to enhance their Mojo skills.
- **Optimization suggestions for Mojo**: A member suggested that optimizing the **tokens list** by pre-allocating capacity could prevent frequent malloc invocations, potentially enhancing performance.
   - Considerations included implementing an **InlineArray** for stack storage if the maximum length permits, aiming to streamline execution.
- **Performance remains unchanged without tokens**: After optimizing, tokens were completely removed from the Mojo code, leaving only the graph execution benchmark, but this change did not significantly impact performance.
   - The author is still exploring avenues for improving the efficiency of their ASR model execution.
- **CPU utilization issues with the model**: One user observed chaotic CPU usage while running the model, noticing it wasn't fully utilizing their CPU capabilities and ignoring hyperthreads.
   - This lack of parallelism in running the model suggests further optimization might be necessary to fully leverage available resources.
