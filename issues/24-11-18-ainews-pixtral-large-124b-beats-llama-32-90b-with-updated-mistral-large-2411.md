> AI News for 11/15/2024-11/18/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**217** channels, and **6180** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **636 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

We last caught up with Mistral in Sept when they released Pixtral ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-pixtral-12b-mistral-beats-llama-to/)), previously the 12B Mistral Nemo + a 400M vision adapter. Mistral have now upsized the vision encoder to 1B, and also, buried in [the footnotes of the Pixtral Large blogpost](https://mistral.ai/news/pixtral-large/), updated the 123B param Mistral Large 24.07 (aka "Mistral Large 2" - [our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-mistral-large-2/)) to "Mistral Large 24.11". The lack of magnet link, lack of blogpost, lack of benchmarks, and refusal to call it "Mistral Large 3" suggest that this update is literally nothing to write home about, but the [updates to function calling and system prompt](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-common/releases/tag/v1.5.0) are worth a peek.

Anyway, it's been a whole [13 days since someone dropped a >100B open weights model](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-tencents-hunyuan-large-claims-to-beat/), so any day that happens is a boon to the Open AI community that we should never take for granted. The big takeaway is that Pixtral Large overwhelmingly beats Llama 3.2 90B on every major multimodal benchmark:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/a7751a3c-2ed7-4253-8c4e-2f9e4ea0d5e7.png?w=960&fit=max)

Although of course one wonders how Llama 3.2 would do if it had an additional 34B weights to memorize things. It's also notable that the Llama 3.2 vision adapter is 20B vs Pixtral Large's 1B.

Lastly, Mistral's [Le Chat got a surprisingly comprehensive set of updates](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-chat/), giving it full the full chatbot feature set compared to its peers.

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/19848e3e-66c6-4eed-8ae9-948d6cf65703.png?w=960&fit=max)

Arthur Mensch [notes](https://x.com/arthurmensch/status/1858567024609276372?s=46) [twice](https://x.com/arthurmensch/status/1858568631358988691?s=46
) that this is part of a company level prioritization of product alongside research.

Since this is a new open weights model, you could also take it for a spin on this issue's inference sponsor! (Help us check them out!)

**[Sponsored by SambaNova]** Processors designed specifically for AI workloads have some major advantages over GPUs. SambaNova’s RDUs have a combination of large addressable memory and dataflow architecture that makes them a lot faster (https://shortclick.link/lk96sw) than other processors for model inference and other AI tasks. 

> Swyx's comment: the [sponsor link](https://shortclick.link/lk96sw) discusses the SN40L "Reconfigurable Dataflow Unit" (RDU) holding "hundreds of models in-memory, equating to trillions of parameters", with the ability to "switches between models in microseconds, up to 100x faster than GPU". A pretty darn cool intro into one of the 3 main "big chip" players heating up the high end XXL-size LLM inference market!

> - `LaTent Reasoning Optimization (LaTRO)`

- **Fast Forward accelerates SGD training**: A new paper introduces **Fast Forward**, a method that accelerates SGD training by repeating the latest optimizer step until loss stops improving, achieving up to an **87% reduction** in FLOPs over standard SGD with Adam.
  
  - This approach was validated across various models and tasks, showing improved training speed without compromising performance.
- **Impacts of training data on quantization limits**: Tim Dettmers highlighted a pivotal paper showing strong evidence that as we train on more tokens, models need **increased precision** to maintain effectiveness, stating we may be reaching the limits of quantization.
  
  - The research suggests that overtraining with more pretraining data might even be **harmful** if quantizing post-training.
- **PrefixQuant offers efficient static quantization**: The **PrefixQuant** technique isolates outlier tokens offline to simplify quantization without needing retraining, enabling efficient per-tensor static quantization to outperform dynamic quantization approaches.
  
  - Using PrefixQuant in Llama-3-8B, the technique showed significant boosts in **accuracy** and inference speed compared to previous methods.
- **Unlocking reasoning capabilities with LaTRO**: **LaTRO** presents a framework that optimizes reasoning capabilities within large language models by sampling from a latent distribution and improving reasoning quality autonomously during training.
  
  - Experiments demonstrated that LaTRO enhanced zero-shot accuracy by **12.5%** on GSM8K, indicating latent reasoning capabilities can be accessed through self-improvement strategies.
