Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **716 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Meta continued its open source AI roll with a worthy sequel to [last year's Segment Anything Model](https://www.latent.space/p/segment-anything-roboflow). Most notably, ontop of being a [better image model than SAM1](https://x.com/josephofiowa/status/1818087114208342527), it now uses [memory attention to scale up image segmentation to apply to video, using remarkably little data and compute](https://x.com/swyx/status/1818085925714620449).  

But the computer vision news was overshadowed by **Apple Intelligence**, which both [delayed the official release to iOS 18.1 in October](https://archive.ph/Wm85S) and released in Developer preview on [MacOS Sequoia (taking a 5GB download)](https://x.com/zaidmukaddam/status/1818000899098231091), [iOS 18](https://x.com/sparkhi/status/1818006585324761098), and [iPadOS 18](https://x.com/TyleTweets/status/1818061615545114704) today (with a very short [waitlist](https://x.com/BrandonButch/status/1817974792282325374), [Siri 2.0 not included](https://x.com/VadimYuryev/status/1818036274223284557), Europeans not included), together with a surprise [47 page paper](https://machinelearning.apple.com/papers/apple_intelligence_foundation_language_models.pdf) going into further detail than their June keynote ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-talaria-apples-new-mlops-superweapon-4066/)).

Cue widespread demos of:

and more. 

As for the paper, the best recap threads from [Bindu](https://x.com/bindureddy/status/1818068830570299521) and [Maxime](https://x.com/maximelabonne/status/1818017461738102823) and  
 [VB](https://x.com/reach_vb/status/1818014366555586611) probably cover it all. Our highlight is the amount of pretrain detail contained on page 6 and 7:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/721a24de-ad6a-4dbb-b4c7-cf48112218bd.png?w=960&fit=max) 

- **Data**: fresh dataset scrape of ? Applebot web crawl, ? licensed datasets, ? code, 3+14b math tokens, ? "public datasets" leading to a final 6.3T tokens for CORE pretraining, 1T tokens with higher code/math mix for CONTINUED pretraining, and 100B tokens for context lengthening (to 32k)
- **Hardware**: AFM was trained with v4 and v5p Cloud TPUs, not Apple Silicon!! AFM-server: 8192 TPUv4, AFM-on-device: 2048 TPUv5p
- **Post Training**: "While Apple Intelligence features are powered through adapters on top of the base model, empirically we found that **improving the general-purpose post-training lifts
the performance of all features**, as the models have stronger capabilities on instruction following, reasoning, and writing.
- [Extensive use of synthetic data for Math, Tool Use, Code, Context Length, Summarization (on Device), automatic redteaming, and committee distillation](https://x.com/swyx/status/1818109227090825261)

Also notable, they disclose their industry standard benchmarks, which we have [taken the liberty of extracting and comparing with Llama 3](https://x.com/swyx/status/1818114253523656946):

> - `Thread Processing Capability`
> - `Integer vs FP32 Units`
> - `Hopper Architecture Insights`
> - `Nvidia's Implementation Secrets` 


- **CUDA Cores represent FP32 capabilities**: The term **CUDA Cores** primarily indicates the number of **FP32** operations that can execute in parallel, which is crucial when considering **FP64** performance due to the limited number of FP64 units compared to FP32 in big accelerators like **H100** and **A100**.
   - *It is important to remember* that the FP32 unit count does not convey the total computational potential of the GPU, especially when factoring in different data types.
- **Thread processing limited to CUDA Core count**: Each **Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)** can handle **as many threads** as there are CUDA cores at any one time, indicating that one thread per CUDA core is the maximum processing capacity.
   - *Yes*, one thread per core means that processing efficiency depends heavily on optimizing thread usage relative to core availability.
- **Integer units function separately from FP32 units**: It was explained that **integer units** operate independently alongside FP32 units, allowing for parallel execution of **integer** calculations even when a GPU features a limited number of CUDA cores.
   - For instance, a GPU with **64 CUDA Cores** can support 64 threads for FP32 compute while another set of 64 can manage integer operations.
- **Hopper has fewer integer units than expected**: It's noted that **Hopper architecture** actually contains only half as many integer units compared to FP32 units, contrary to previous architectures like **A100** and **V100**, which had matching counts.
   - This insight reflects evolving design considerations in modern GPUs for optimizing specific computational tasks.
- **Nvidia keeps architectural details under wraps**: Despite sharing schematics and diagrams, some aspects of Nvidia's in-silicon implementation remain tightly guarded business secrets.
   - As such, even detailed diagrams like those discussing **arithmetic units** can be seen as abstractions from actual architectural realities.

- **AWQ Implementation Simplified**: The most basic form of **AWQ** involves creating an **AQT layout class** that stores activation channel scales, allowing for a straightforward implementation.
   - Members discussed potential improvements and scaling methods, considering **block_size** and group-based approaches for effective implementation.
- **Recent Changes in AQT are Confusing**: The recent modification in **AQT** requires input weights to be pre-packed before using `_convert_weight_to_int4pack`, resulting in unexpected performance metrics.
   - Discussion included a **runtime error** arising from adjusted input weight requirements, confirming that the tests in **ao** are currently disabled for nightly builds.
- **Noteworthy Performance Observations**: When comparing **torchao** with **bitblas**, the performance is close, with torchao delivering 94 tokens/sec and bitblas 97 tokens/sec for 4-bit models with batch size 1.
   - Further comparisons indicate that as batch size increases, performance significantly drops, especially for 2-bit models using **HQQ+** with **Llama3**.
- **Challenges in 2-bit Llama3 Quantization**: The **2-bit Llama3 model** faces quantization challenges, particularly at lower bits, impacting speed and quality, even with techniques like **low-rank adapters**.
   - Despite difficulties, it runs efficiently with the **BitBlas** framework, achieving speeds of **95-120 tokens/sec**, similar to its 4-bit counterparts.
- **Future Directions for uint4 Tensor Subclass**: There are plans to establish a **default packing format** of `[n][k/2]` for the upcoming **uint4 tensor subclass**, transitioning it to an optimized layout as needed.
   - This change could streamline processes and potentially merge layout functionalities from **AffineQuantizedTensor** to the uint4 tensor design.

> - `Dyson OnTrac Headphones`
> - `Himalayas Zombies`
> - `Cultural Insults`
> - `RMS and LUFS Calculation`
> - `German Bureaucracy in Kaiju Invasion` 


- **Dyson enters the audio market**: Dyson has launched its new OnTrac headphones, priced at **$500** and designed for high-end audio performance, moving away from the previous Zone model focused on air purification.
   - The headphones feature **40mm neodymium drivers** and advanced noise cancellation technology that reduces ambient noise by up to **40 dB**.
- **Himalayan Zombies vs Western Zombies**: In Tibetan culture, **ro-langs** are the unique portrayal of zombies, diverging significantly from typical Western interpretations, reflecting local beliefs.
   - This cultural understanding offers insights into the spiritual narratives present in Himalayan mythology.
- **Origins of the terms 'khokhol' and 'katsap'**: The derogatory terms **'khokhol'** and **'katsap'** have historical roots, with **'khokhol'** originally describing a traditional Cossack hairstyle, whereas **'katsap'** may derive from various linguistic origins suggesting a negative connotation towards Russians.
   - These terms have evolved into insults in contemporary Ukrainian and Russian discourse, often reflecting historical animosities.
- **Calculating RMS and LUFS**: The Root Mean Square (RMS) is calculated by taking the square root of the average of squared amplitude samples, whereas LUFS also involves specific normalization related to loudness.
   - The understanding of these calculations is essential for audio professionals in mastering and engineering sound.
- **Germany's Kaiju Invasion Plan**: A detailed plan to handle a **200m tall kaiju invasion** in Germany is being crafted, with an emphasis on the bureaucratic processes involved.
   - The scenario humorously highlights the complexities and challenges of response protocols inherent in German governance during an unexpected disaster.

> - `Using tinygrad for time series analysis` 


- **Resolving NLL Loss Error in tinygrad PR**: A user shared an error related to adding `nll_loss`, noting that the returned tensor lacks gradients, causing PR failure.
   - Another member mentioned that certain operations used in the loss computation, like CMPNE, are non-differentiable.
- **Clarifying Gradients with nn.Embedding**: A user sought help on `nn.Embedding` gradients, encountering a 'tensor has no grad' error in their model.
   - A reply clarified that `requires_grad=True` is unnecessary for index operations to avoid gradient issues.
- **Explanation of Disk Device Functionality**: A user inquired about the disk device in tinygrad, questioning its role in computations.
   - It was explained that the disk device is utilized for tensor memory mapping, primarily for transferring data, not for computational operations.
- **Proposal for Enhancing Error Handling**: A user suggested that tinygrad should not allow tensors on non-computational backends like disk and seek better error messages.
   - Members discussed the necessity of handling such cases and agreed on contributing a pull request to improve the behavior.
- **Using tinygrad for Time Series Analysis**: A user asked if tinygrad could be applied for time series physiological feature extraction and visualizations, citing slow performance with Matlab.
   - This inquiry indicates interest in leveraging tinygrad's capabilities for more efficient computations in data analysis.
