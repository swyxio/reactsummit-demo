  **OpenAI** released the full version of the **o3** agent, with a new **Deep
  Research** variant showing significant improvements on the **HLE benchmark**
  and achieving SOTA results on **GAIA**. The release includes an "inference
  time scaling" chart demonstrating rigorous research, though some criticism
  arose over public test set results. The agent is noted as "extremely simple"
  and currently limited to 100 queries/month, with plans for a higher-rate
  version. Reception has been mostly positive, with some skepticism.
  Additionally, advances in **reinforcement learning** were highlighted,
  including a simple test-time scaling technique called **budget forcing** that
  improved reasoning on math competitions by 27%. Researchers from **Google
  DeepMind**, **NYU**, **UC Berkeley**, and **HKU** contributed to these
  findings. The original **Gemini Deep Research** team will participate in the
  upcoming AI Engineer NYC event.

> AI News for 1/31/2025-2/3/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **34** Discords (**225** channels, and **16942** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **1721 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

When introducing Operator ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-openai-launches-operator-its-first-agent/)), sama hinted at more OpenAI Agents soon on the way, but few of us were expecting the next one in 9 days, shipped [from Japan](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1886149471249264675?t=0O8ujtyOOzkt3VZ6dk_alg&s=19) on a US Sunday no less:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkCDVn3_wiw

The [blogpost](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) offers more insight into intended usecases, but the bit notable is Deep Research's result on Dan Hendrycks' new HLE benchmark more than doubling the result of o3-mini-high released just on Friday ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-o3-mini-launches-openai-on-wrong-side-of/)).

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/dd6ff729-2535-4fce-b0a7-d2a8be67b4be.png?w=960&fit=max)

They also released a SOTA result on GAIA - which was [criticized by coauthors](https://x.com/clefourrier/status/1886385835324457143?s=46) for just releasing public test set results - obviously problematic for an agent that can surf the web, though there is zero reason to question the integrity of this especially when confirmed [in footnotes](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/#citation-bottom-1) and as samples of the GAIA test traces were published.

OAIDR comes with its own version of the "inference time scaling" chart which is very impressive - not in the scaling of the chart itself, but in the clear rigor demonstrated in the research process that made producing such a chart possible (assuming, of course, that this is research, not marketing, but here the lines are unfortunately blurred to sell a $200/month subscription).

OpenAI staffers [confirmed](https://x.com/sherwinwu/status/1886256203077915071?s=46) that this is the first time the full o3 has been released in the wild (and gdb says it is "[an extremely simple agent](https://x.com/gdb/status/1886229270428848399?s=46)"), and the blogpost notes that a "o3-deep-research-mini" version is on the way which will raise rate limits from the 100 queries/month available today.

Reception has been mostly [positive](https://x.com/afinetheorem/status/1886206439582015870?s=46), sometimes to the point of [hyperventilation](https://x.com/dharmesh/status/1886510930420195816). Some folks are [making fun](https://x.com/distributionat/status/1886238792870461451) of the hyperbole, but on balance we tend to agree with the positive takes of [Ethan Mollick](https://x.com/emollick/status/1886205847803429173?s=46) and  [Dan Shipper](https://x.com/danshipper/status/1886203397004783996?s=46), though we do experience a [lot of failures](https://x.com/nabeelqu/status/1886493788459413623) as well.

> `Unsloth and dynamic quantization, Using Ollama with custom models, Gradient accumulation in model training, Batch inference with FastLanguageModel, Model compatibility across different environments` 


- **Unsloth's Dynamic Quantization Benefits**: Unsloth's dynamic quantization reduces model size by up to **80%** while maintaining accuracy, particularly for models like DeepSeek R1.
   - The blog post outlines how to effectively run and fine-tune the model using specified quantization methods.
- **Using Ollama with Custom Fine-tuned Models**: To utilize a fine-tuned Mistral model with Ollama, one can follow the Unsloth documentation which simplifies the process for local integration.
   - Using the `FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained` method allows for conversion to 4-bit and saving with ease.
- **Understanding Gradient Accumulation**: Gradient accumulation helps to mitigate VRAM usage by allowing models to train on feedback from generated completions only.
   - This method enhances stability and is recommended over directly training on previous inputs, as it preserves the context.
- **Efficient Batch Inference Techniques**: For batch inference using `FastLanguageModel`, inputs can be tokenized all at once and predictions generated in a single call.

> `VLLM Offloading with GGUF, Dynamic Quantization for Inferencing, DeepSeek R1 Performance, Test Time Compute Strategies, Horizontal vs Vertical Distillation` 


- **VLLM Offloading Limitations**: Currently, **VLLM** cannot handle offloading with **GGUF**, particularly not with the **DeepSeek V2** architecture without recent patches.
   - This limitation raises questions about optimizing workflows that depend on offloading capabilities.
- **Dynamic Quantization Challenges**: Users are exploring **1.58-bit quantized models** for inferencing but face issues with **dynamic quantization** not always adhering to this bit specification.
   - Though a normal **LlamaCPP** quantized model can be used, there are concerns about its performance under current setups.
- **DeepSeek R1 Tokens per Second**: Users are reporting performance metrics of about **4 tokens/s** for **DeepSeek R1** quantized at a context window of **8192**, leading to discussions about potential optimizations.
   - The conversation revolves around the accuracy of these metrics and the strategies for boosting throughput.
- **Innovative Test Time Compute Strategies**: Introducing **budget forcing** was discussed as a means to control **test-time compute**, encouraging models to double-check answers by extending reasoning times.
   - This method aims to improve reasoning performance and is backed by the curated dataset of **1,000 questions** which fulfills specific criteria.
- **Horizontal vs Vertical Distillation Insights**: The concept of **horizontal distillation**, where the same model size is maintained while improving performance by training new R1s from the best, was debated.
   - There's a notable discussion on whether fresh distillation or this horizontal approach yields better outcomes in model generation and reasoning.

> `Probability of Random Language Model Weights, Volume Hypothesis in Deep Learning, Importance Sampling in High Dimensions, Network Complexity and Alignment` 


- **Probability of Getting a Functional Language Model**: The chance of obtaining a fully functional language model by randomly guessing weights is about one in **360 million** zeros, as calculated by a team studying neural networks.
   - They emphasize that this estimate reflects **complexity**—the lower the probability, the **more complex** the model.
- **Volume Hypothesis sheds Light on Deep Learning**: Their method for estimating network sampling probability helps illuminate the **volume hypothesis** which correlates to sampling networks from weight space with low training loss.
   - The work strives to measure volume effectively as a means to understand how deep learning operates under vague assumptions.
- **Importance of Sampling Outlier Directions**: The study highlights that gathering data from **high-dimensional spaces** is tricky, where small outlier directions can drastically affect volume measurements.
   - They introduced **importance sampling** using gradient information to increase the chance of capturing these outlier scenarios.
- **Higher Complexity Linked to Overfitting**: It was found that networks that memorize training data exhibit lower **local volume**, indicating higher complexity compared to those that generalize well.
   - This link suggests that overfitting models possess additional unaligned reasoning that could lead to concerns and misalignments with human values.
- **Resources Shared for Further Exploration**: The team encouraged interest in their project by sharing a GitHub repository on the topic [basin-volume](https://github.com/EleutherAI/basin-volume) and a research paper on arXiv.
   - They provided various resources like code, a [Twitter thread](https://x.com/norabelrose/status/1886504219919966320), and links for deeper insights into their exploratory findings.

> `Reproduction of R1 results, Censorship in Language Models, Mixture of Experts (MoE), DeepSeek's behavior, Community engagement in AI` 


- **Replication Failures of R1 on SmolLM2**: Current tests show that **SmolLM2 135M** has worse autointerp scores and higher reconstruction errors for **SAEs** trained on random models compared to those trained on real models.
   - The replication of the original results from the paper using **Pythia** is failing, raising questions about the validity of the initial claims.
- **Censorship Issues with DeepSeek**: Discussants noted that **DeepSeek** provides different responses about sensitive topics such as **Tiananmen Square**, depending on the language of prompt, highlighting potential biases in its design.
   - It seems the model's responses can be influenced by censorship mechanisms, with some suggesting ways to bypass these limitations using clever prompting.
- **DeepSeek’s Nationalistic Messaging**: Users observe that **DeepSeek** gives a distinctly nationalistic narrative on questions related to **Taiwan**, contrasting with its responses on **Tiananmen**, which were more restrictive.
   - This inconsistency raises concerns about the **censorship model** employed and how it adapts based on the subject matter.
- **Educational Resources on Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: A user sought resources on **Mixture of Experts** (MoE), prompting shared links to comprehensive visual guides and YouTube videos explaining the concept.
   - An associated channel exists for discussions about MoE, although its activity level is uncertain.
- **Community Contributions to AI Projects**: A new user expressed interest in contributing to projects related to AI safety and policy, pointing out a scarcity of such initiatives in Italy.
   - The community is encouraged to engage in discussions about useful tools, such as a drag-and-drop interface for LLM assembly, fostering collaboration.

> `DeepSeek Math paper metrics, DRAW architecture for image generation, Learning-rate schedules in optimization, Distillation processes in model training, Complexity measures in neural networks` 


- **Understanding Pass@K and Maj@K Metrics**: In the DeepSeek Math paper, Pass@K indicates if any parsed answer passes for K repeats, while Maj@K refers to the majority answer passing across these repeats.
   - This second metric, Maj@K, is particularly relevant for numeric outputs or concise outputs like multiple-choice questions.
- **DRAW Architecture Overview**: The DRAW network architecture introduces a novel spatial attention mechanism that mimics human foveation, enhancing image generation capabilities.
   - It significantly improves generative model performance on datasets like MNIST and Street View House Numbers, producing indistinguishable images from real data.
- **Learning-rate Schedules in Non-Smooth Convex Optimization**: Recent work highlights surprisingly close relationships between learning-rate schedules in large model training and non-smooth convex optimization theory.
   - These insights provide practical benefits for learning-rate tuning, leading to better training of models such as Llama-types.
- **Synthetic Data and Distillation in Model Training**: Discussion revolves around the potential use of synthetic datasets for training, including methods like reinforcement learning and general policy optimization.
   - This approach may help in fine-tuning smaller models using outputs derived from larger models' synthetic examples.
- **Complexity Measures in Neural Networks**: There are speculations about using complexity measures to detect undesired reasoning in neural networks; the goal is to align networks with human values without ulterior motives.
   - The discussion points to prior work linking simplicity in neural networks to inductive biases, focusing on local volume and the evolution of model complexity.

- **Chalmers on Propositional Attitudes**: A new paper by [David Chalmers](https://x.com/norabelrose/status/1885454252656779778) argues that **extracting propositional attitudes** from AI is more impactful than pursuing mechanistic understanding.
   - Chalmers also cited a [previously published paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15740) from the team, expressing gratitude for the reference.
- **Crosscoder Repositories Discussion**: A member inquired about **open source repositories** for training and using crosscoders, highlighting the ongoing challenge of reproducibility in the field.
   - Another member shared a GitHub link to [dictionary_learning](https://github.com/jkminder/dictionary_learning) as a potential resource.
- **Sparse Autoencoders and Optimization Scalability**: There was a discussion about the **challenges of sparse recovery**, suggesting that the search for the right representation typically requires iterative methods.
   - It was pointed out that the scale required for effective analysis might render these methods infeasible in practice.
- **Evaluating Experts in Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: Discussion centered on identifying the **most active experts** in a DeepMind code contests dataset, with frequency and weight data provided for several experts.
   - The top experts were highlighted, and it was noted that their performance assessments might help inform pruning strategies in MoE models.
- **Cosine Similarity vs Euclidean Distance in Expert Weights**: Clarification was given that the **distance metric used** for the analysis of expert distributions was euclidean, rather than cosine similarity as initially assumed.
   - Cosine similarity was actually referenced as a derived metric based on expert distribution vectors aggregated by the MoE gating module.
