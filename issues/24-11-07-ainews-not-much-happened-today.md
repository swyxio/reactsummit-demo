> - `Adding special tokens`
> - `Fine-tuning with LORA` 


- **Proper way to add special tokens for fine-tuning**: To add a new **special token** to a LLM for fine-tuning, one should add the token to the tokenizer before training and include it in the Axolotl configuration with `special_tokens: reference_text: <|reference_text|>`.
