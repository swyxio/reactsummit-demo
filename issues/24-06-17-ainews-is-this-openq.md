## [DiscoResearch](https://discord.com/channels/1178995845727785010) Discord

- **Llama3 Sticks to Its Roots**: Despite the introduction of a German model, the **Llama3 tokenizer** has *not* been modified and remains identical to the base Llama3, raising questions about its efficiency in handling German tokens.
- **Token Talk**: Concerns emerged over the unchanged tokenizer, with engineers speculating that not incorporating specific German tokens *could substantially reduce the context window* and affect the quality of embeddings.
- **Comparing Llama2 and Llama3 Token Sizes**: *Inquisitive minds* noted that **Llama3's tokenizer is notably 4 times larger than Llama2's**, leading to questions about its existing efficacy with the German language and potential unrecognized issues.

- **Facing issues with Triton on Windows**: A member reported issues installing Triton on Windows 11 even after setting up Visual C++ correctly. Assistance was provided by querying if `g++` or `clang++` could be called from the terminal.

- **Data Preparation Tutorial Request**: A member inquired about a data preparation tutorial for Unsloth fine-tuning similar to [OpenAI's chat fine-tuning data prep notebook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/chat_finetuning_data_prep). Another member cited a plan to create a tutorial and recommended a related [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/3eq84KrdTWY).

- **Model training crashes during saving**: A member experienced crashes while training the Yi model during the last saving steps, suspecting memory or disk space issues. It was suggested to check available memory and disk space, and a [link to Unsloth's saving issues on GitHub](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/wiki#saving-to-gguf--vllm-16bit-crashes) was provided.

- **Issues with batch size and gradient accumulation**: A member questioned the discrepancy in VRAM usage when adjusting batch size and gradient accumulation. Discussions clarified that gradient accumulation steps act similar to increasing batch size, and experimenting with larger batch sizes was recommended.

- **Error with quantization_method in save.py**: A bug was identified where `quantization_method` was mishandled as a string, leading to errors. A workaround involved passing `quantization_method` as a list, and a [pull request](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/pull/651) to fix the bug was submitted.

- **Lighting AI Interface Suggestions**: A member shared the [NVIDIA warp example code](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp/blob/main/warp/examples/core/example_sph.py) and sought advice on a graphical interface to see the rendered results. They considered setting up a VNC session to resolve the issue.

- **Solved NVRTC Compilation Error**: A user described an issue with NVRTC where compiling multiple kernels resulted in 'invalid resource handle'. They later resolved it by avoiding initializing a new context for each compilation, which was causing CUDA to free the modules/functions.

- **GPU SM Count Discrepancy**: A query was raised about the discrepancies between measured and reported SM counts for the [A10G GPU](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/a10g.c3798), noting that techpowerup reports 72 SMs while pycuda measures 80. It was clarified that the site might be wrong and [other sources](https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/ec2/NVIDIA_AWS_A10G_DataSheet_FINAL_02_17_2022.pdf) confirm 80 SMs.

- **New NVIDIA 5090 GPU Speculations**: Members discussed the upcoming NVIDIA 5090, with speculations about it having up to 64 GB of VRAM ([source](https://www.techpowerup.com/323495/possible-specs-of-nvidia-geforce-blackwell-gpu-lineup-leaked)). There were debates about the likelihood of these specs, with pessimistic views on seeing 64GB in consumer versions.

- **Value of Forum Knowledge in Daily AI Work**: A member expressed doubts about the practical value of most discussions in their daily AI work apart from a few specific topics. Others responded by emphasizing the importance of performance optimization and the general value of learning and being part of such communities.

- **Quant API Import Documentation Issue**: A member flagged a correction stating, *``unwrap_tensor_subclass()`` should be imported from `torchao.utils` or `torchao.quantization.quant_api`*, not `torchao.quantization.utils`. They emphasized the importance of users calling `unwrap_tensor_subclass()` before compiling the quant model to avoid errors.

- **API Release Delay and BC Issues**: It was confirmed that the **0.3 release is being delayed** due to backward compatibility issues that need resolution. This delay ensures the team can address and fix critical problems.

- **Innovative API Naming with 'brrr' Proposal**: There was a playful yet practical suggestion to create an API with the name **`brrr` that adds additional experimental flags** based on the number of 'r's. A member humorously asked if this was serious but also hinted at a need for easier control over `torchinductor` flags like `use_mixed_mm`.

- **Feedback on `use_mixed_mm` Flag**: A member suggested enabling the `use_mixed_mm` flag by default if the relevant kernel in AO is on. This feedback may lead to a GitHub issue for further discussion and implementation.

- **DataLoader PR merged, surprising no performance difference**: The Permuted DataLoader PR was merged after some discussion and testing, although initial runs showed no performance improvement. [A surprised Aleksa retested and finally confirmed a slight improvement in validation loss](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/573).

- **Stochastic rounding only with unique seeds**: The PR to ensure unique seeds for stochastic rounding was [discussed](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/597). The team discovered that an overflow feature in their approach was actually intended by the noise function algorithm.

- **ZeRO-2 PR has noticeable memory overhead**: PR 593 for ZeRO-2 was discussed for its complexity and memory overhead. [Suggestions included falling back to ZeRO-1 for certain parameters](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/593).

- **Master weight storage**: A PR (https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/522) to save master weights to resume state was merged to improve determinism. Follow-up tasks included verifying determinism through CI and exploring memory-saving techniques [such as saving 16-bit master weights](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/432).

- **LayerNorm kernel optimization delivers speedup**: Profiling data indicated that the new LayerNorm kernel (kernel 6) was faster than the older ones (kernel 3 and 5). [This boosted certain tasks significantly](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/600) especially under specific configurations, like recompute=2.

- **Defining 2D Numpy Arrays with Mojo**: Users discussed the limitations of Mojo in passing nested lists to Python and shared workarounds using the `ast` module and `Python.import_module`. For example, one user suggested a function `ndarray` that converts a string representation of a nested list to a Numpy array, which is then returned as a Python object.
- **Differences Between `DTypePointer` and `Pointer[SomeDType]`**: Users highlighted that `DTypePointer` is preferable for SIMD operations, as it allows for efficient `simd_load` instructions. This was particularly helpful for a user who wanted to understand the performance implications of using each type.
- **VSCode Integration with Mojo**: A member asked how to include directories in VSCode for Mojo, and another provided a way to do so via `settings.json`. This helps VSCode analyze Mojo packages by adding `"mojo.lsp.includeDirs": [ "/Users/your-name/your-mojo-files" ]`.
- **Bug in Casting and Contextual Behavior**: A user reported a bug when casting unsigned integers using `int()` or `UInt32()`, experiencing different behavior between running the script and using the REPL. A GitHub [issue](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/3065) was created to track this inconsistency.
- **CRC32 Table Calculation with Var vs. Alias**: A detailed discussion revealed an issue when using `alias` instead of `var` to initialize CRC32 tables, leading to different results due to casting behaviors. The minimal example showed that overflowing as if signed was occurring unexpectedly, prompting an investigation into the alias-specific behavior.

- **Negative results for generalization improvements**: The team experimented with various modifications such as strong-to-strong training, modified loss functions, and several probe-based experiments, with *"generally negative results"*. Among these, only the log-confidence auxiliary loss showed potential signs of consistent improvement in generalization.

- **Detailed findings published**: The detailed findings and results of their investigations on weak-to-strong generalization in open-source models like Qwen1.5 0.5B and Llama 3 8B can be found in their latest [blog post](https://blog.eleuther.ai/weak-to-strong/).
