  **Anyscale** launched their **LLMPerf leaderboard** to benchmark large
  language model inference performance, but it faced criticism for lacking
  detailed metrics like cost per token and throughput, and for comparing public
  LLM endpoints without accounting for batching and load. In **OpenAI Discord**
  discussions, users reported issues with **Bard** and preferred **Microsoft
  Copilot** for storytelling, noting fewer hallucinations. There was debate on
  the value of upgrading from **GPT-3.5** to **GPT-4**, with many finding paid
  AI models worthwhile for coding productivity. Bugs and performance issues with
  OpenAI APIs were also highlighted, including slow responses and message
  limits. Future AI developments like **GPT-6** and concerns about OpenAI's
  transparency and profitability were discussed. Prompt engineering for image
  generation was another active topic, emphasizing clear positive prompts and
  the desire for negative prompts.

- **Image Generation with DALLE**: User `@suptrox` wanted to generate an image that only showcases a garden landscape, and wondered if DALLE supports negative prompts to suppress unwanted elements. 
- `@eskcanta` responded by advising that AI generally performs better with positive rather than negative instructions. They demonstrated this by generating a series of four images representing an "endless natural, unspoiled, pristine garden" using the ChatGPT-4 model. Their advice for getting the desired output was to accurately describe what one wants, review the output, and iteratively refine the instructions based on the observed discrepancies.
- Several users, such as `@catking335` and `@bambooshoots`, expressed admiration for the generated image. `@catking335` asked about the creation process, to which `@eskcanta` detailed the prompt they used and recommended techniques to enhance the model's output, such as having a more detailed conversation with the model to fine-tune the desired output.

## [Alignment Lab AI](https://discord.com/channels/1087862276448595968) Discord Summary

- Progress in chunking documents for embedding to generate a multi-billion synthetic token dataset; demonstrated approach employs recursive segmentation into 512 length pieces with the title appended back before embedding, detailed by `@emrgnt_cmplxty`.
- Discussion on applying hierarchical search to the chunked documents, using the natural hierarchy of the web; an initial vector search indexes the leading chunk and title for each webpage, followed by a fetch of the full chunks for the top N matches, which are then re-ranked using the most similar chunk from each. The method amounts to an approximate 30 times reduction in the embeddings needed for the initial search stage. 
- Mention of document summary preparation by `@gabriel_syme`, corroborating the preparatory processes shared by `@emrgnt_cmplxty`.
- Introduction to the [Mergekit](https://github.com/cg123/mergekit) toolkit on GitHub for merging pretrained large language models, illustrated with a user model case: [MetaMath-neural-chat-7b-v3-2-Slerp](https://huggingface.co/Weyaxi/MetaMath-neural-chat-7b-v3-2-Slerp).
- Inquiry from `@cryptossssun` on the development of long context field abilities, target context recognition and extraction in AI models. 
- Query on the fine-tuning process in comparison with a 7-billion parameter model, leading to a remark by `@caseus_` on the model "qlora" under discussion, denoting its current state as less than satisfactory.

- **Chunking documents for embedding**: `@emrgnt_cmplxty` discussed their approach to preparing documents for embedding, mentioning that they are chunking the documents recursively into 512 length chunks, and then appending the title back on before embedding.
- **Generating a multi-billion synthetic token dataset**: `@emrgnt_cmplxty` stated the approach of preparing the documents for embedding will help generate a **multi-billion synthetic token dataset** without worries about quality. 
- **Hierarchical Search**: `@emrgnt_cmplxty` clarified that by hierarchical search, they mean they use the natural hierarchy of the web to perform the search. They index the leading chunk + title for each webpage and use that as the first vector search. They then fetch the full chunks for the top N matches and use the most similar chunk from each webpage to re-rank, which results in approximately a factor of 30 reduction in the embeddings needed to search over at the first stage. 
- **Preparation for document summaries**: `@gabriel_syme` mentioned that they are also preparing for a similar process with document summaries.
