- **Inquiring the Pretrain-to-RLHF Transition**: A member was curious about if a step like **instruction-tuning (IFT)** is necessary in the usual **Pretraining -> IFT -> RLHF** pipeline for language models. They pondered whether jumping directly to **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) from a pretrained model is feasible, considering human preference ratings implicitly teach instruction following during RLHF. They hypothesized that instruction following might be simpler to teach with a supervised dataset given its straightforward nature, contrasting with the complexity of generating good output. The query was sparked by a student's question in a [Stanford CS224N lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXpJ9EmG3s4).

- **Blurred Lines in Training Phases**: In response, another member hinted that the boundaries between pretraining, instruction following tuning, and RLHF are not clear-cut in practice, implying that the training processes are **blended together**.

- **Seeking Clarity on Model Training Blending**: The member seeking information pondered over what "blending" means, asking if it involves combining the datasets for pretraining, SFT (Supervised Fine Tuning), and RLHF prompts in some way, and noted the variance in the objective functions used in PT/SFT versus RLHF. They requested further resources for clarity.

- **Anticipation for Upcoming Resources on Annealing**: The same member who discussed the blended practice mentioned upcoming, potentially undocumented methods in **model training**, including curriculums, schedulers, or annealing. They teased that there should be something on **annealing** available soon.
