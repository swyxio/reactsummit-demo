We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**393** channels, and **2911** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **337 minutes**.

Together with [Anthropic's GA of tool use/function calling](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1796210547077128578) today on Anthropic/Amazon/Google, with support for [streaming](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1791137394563133849), [forced use](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1791137396798677234), and [vision](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1791137398266659286)...

Alex Albert shared [5 architectures](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1796211969432887331) for using them in an agentic context:

1. **Delegation**: Use cheaper, faster models for cost and speed gains. 
  - For example, Opus can delegate to Haiku to read a book and return relevant passages. This works well if the task description & result are more compact than the full context.
2. **Parallelization**: Cut latency (but not cost) by running agents in parallel. 
  - e.g. 100 sub-agents each read a different chapter of a book, then return key passages. 
3. **Debate**: Multiple agents with different roles engage in discussion to reach better decisions.
  - For example, a software engineer proposes code, a security engineer reviews it, a product manager gives a user's view, then a final agent synthesizes and decides.
4. **Specialization**:  A generalist agent orchestrates, while specialists execute tasks.
  - For example, the main agent uses a specifically prompted (or fine-tuned) medical model for health queries or a legal model for legal questions.
5. **Tool Suite Experts**: When using 100s or 1000s of tools, specialize agents in tool subsets.
  - Each specialist (the same model, but with different tools) handles a specific toolset. The orchestrator then maps tasks to the right specialist (keeps the orchestrator prompt short).

Nothing particularly groundbreaking here but a very handy list to think about for patterns. Anthropic also [launched a self guided course on tool use](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1796610971810853165):

# AI Twitter Recap

> all recaps done by Claude 3 Opus, best of 4 runs. We are working on clustering and flow engineering with Haiku.

**AI Research and Development**

- **Open Science and Research Funding**: [@ylecun](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1796486618620051933) expressed a clear ethical rule for research: "Do not get research funding from entities that restrict your ability to publish." He emphasized that **making new knowledge available to the world is intrinsically good**, regardless of the funding source. [@ylecun](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1796488253815603279) noted that this ethical rule has made him a **strong advocate of open science and open source**.
- **Emergence of Superintelligence**: [@ylecun](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1796543960296440162) believes the emergence of superintelligence will be a **gradual process**, not a sudden event. He envisions starting with an architecture at the intelligence level of a rat or squirrel and **progressively ramping up its intelligence** while designing proper guardrails and safety mechanisms. The goal is to design an **objective-driven AI that fulfills goals specified by humans**.
- **Convolutional Networks for Image and Video Processing**: [@ylecun](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1796265384976252991) recommends using **convolutions with stride or pooling at low levels and self-attention circuits at higher levels** for real-time image and video processing. He believes [@sainingxie](https://twitter.com/sainingxie)'s work on ConvNext has shown that **convolutional networks can be just as good as vision transformers if done right**. [@ylecun](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1796263750485295560) argues that self-attention is equivariant to permutations, which is nonsensical for low-level image/video processing, and that **global attention is not scalable** since correlations are highly local in images and video.
- **AI Researchers in Industry vs. Academia**: [@ylecun](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1796518343194845658) noted that if a graph showed absolute numbers instead of percentages, it would reveal that the **numbers of AI researchers in industry, academia, and government have all grown**, with industry growing earlier and faster than the rest.

- **Love/Hate Relationship with Single Vector Embeddings**: Although single-vector embeddings are useful for prototyping, they fall short of a full retrieval pipeline. ColBERT surpasses single-vector methods in out-of-domain tasks due to its token-level encodings, which provide richer information for OOD scenarios ([Vespa blog on ColBERT](https://blog.vespa.ai/announcing-colbert-embedder-in-vespa/)).

- **Sparse Embeddings and M3 Mentioned Briefly**: The discussion will briefly touch on sparse embeddings and M3, focusing primarily on the advantages and limitations of single-vector embeddings for retrieval pipelines.

- **ColBERT's Detailed Output**: Unlike single-vector methods that pool everything into a 1024-dimensional vector per document, ColBERT produces numerous 128-dimensional vectors, one per token, resulting in a higher dimensional output for more detailed information processing. For instance, 500 documents with 300 tokens each yield an output of `500,300,128`.

- **NVIDIA's new 4nm chip blows Blackwell out of the water**: NVIDIA's new research chip achieves 96 int4 TOPs/Watt compared to Blackwell's 20T/W, representing significant power efficiency. For more details, check out the [full research talk](https://youtu.be/gofI47kfD28?si=41UIMkpMCyb_qWqA).
  
- **Confusion around float4's exponent and mantissa**: Daniel Han mentions that B200's float4 is claimed to have an exponent and mantissa both equal to 2, leading to confusion. Typically, for float4, a common configuration is *sign bit + exponent + mantissa = 4*; hence the discussion on whether NVIDIA's configuration lacks a sign bit.

- **Notable speed-ups from reduced numerical representation**: Daniel highlights that significant speed-ups are not solely due to Moore's Law but from reducing the numerical representation from fp32 to f4, providing a 32x boost. However, the Physics of LLMs paper shows int4 can be 2x worse, indicating limits to these performance improvements. Check the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05405).

- **Tensor Cores and HMMA provide remarkable efficiency**: Tensor Cores using complex instructions like HMMA achieve 13x faster performance with lower energy consumption, playing a critical role in enhancing computational efficiency.

- **Progress in sparsity techniques**: NVIDIA is working on shifting from 2:4 to 2:8 sparsity, which could further optimize computational efficiency and performance in AI models.

- **RLHF/DPO's surprising limitation**: A shared [tweet](https://x.com/_angie_chen/status/1796220428345573399) suggested that RLHF/DPO does not effectively produce policies that assign a higher likelihood to preferred responses. This insight sparked confusion and debate among members, questioning the efficacy of these algorithms in preference learning.

- **Debate on ranking accuracy**: Members discussed the concept of "ranking accuracy," seeking to understand its definition and implications in the context of reference models. It was concluded that preference learning aims to train models for high ranking accuracy, meaning they can rank preferred outputs higher than dispreferred ones, but this doesn't seem to hold true universally.

- **Overfitting revelation**: After multiple members reviewed the thread, it was suggested that the discovery might show that it's possible to overfit when using RLHF/DPO methods. This opinion was countered by pointing out that the discussion could involve deeper mathematical proof about why DPO, especially without additional measures like NLL, underperforms.

- **Comparing techniques**: Members mentioned that problems similar to those found in DPO are also present in PPO, which is used by OpenAI. Another user highlighted that DPO models, despite their issues, tend to perform better than SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) alone.
