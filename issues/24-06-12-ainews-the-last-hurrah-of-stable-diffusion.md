title: The Last Hurrah of Stable Diffusion?
date: '2024-06-12T22:08:29.963442Z'
original_slug: ainews-the-last-hurrah-of-stable-diffusion
description: >-
  **Stability AI** launched **Stable Diffusion 3 Medium** with models ranging
  from **450M to 8B parameters**, featuring the MMDiT architecture and T5 text
  encoder for image text rendering. The community has shown mixed reactions
  following the departure of key researchers like Emad Mostaque. On AI models,
  **Llama 3 8B Instruct** shows strong evaluation correlation with **GPT-4**,
  while **Qwen 2 Instruct** surpasses Llama 3 on MMLU benchmarks. The **Mixture
  of Agents (MoA)** framework outperforms GPT-4o on AlpacaEval 2.0. Techniques
  like **Spectrum** and **QLoRA** enable efficient fine-tuning with less VRAM.
  Research on **grokking** reveals transformers can transition from memorization
  to generalization through extended training. Benchmark initiatives include the
  **$1M ARC Prize Challenge** for AGI progress and **LiveBench**, a live LLM
  benchmark to prevent dataset contamination. The **Character Codex Dataset**
  offers open data on over **15,000 characters** for RAG and synthetic data. The
  **MLX 0.2** tool enhances LLM experience on Apple Silicon Macs with improved
  UI and faster retrieval-augmented generation.

> AI News for 6/11/2024-6/12/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**413** channels, and **3555** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **388 minutes**. Track [AINews on Twitter](https://x.com/smol_ai).

SD3 Medium was launched today with an unusually (for Stability) flashy video:

<figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b0b3bf6b-1a67-4f19-aea8-61eb562a0437.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" draggable="false" contenteditable="false"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The [SD3 research paper](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3-research-paper) is noteworthy for it's detail on the MMDiT architecture and usage of the T5 text encoder for text rendering in images, but also for mentioning its range of models from 450M to 8B params, making the 2B parameter SD3 Medium not the most powerful SD3 version available.

If you've been diligently reading the Discord Summaries for the Stability AI discord, you'll have known that the community has been fretting about the open weights release of SD3, [first announced 3 months ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39466630), released [as Paper](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39599958) and [as API](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40065114), on an almost daily basis, particularly since the exit of Emad Mostaque and Robin Rombach and many of the senior researchers involved in the original Stable Diffusion. Adding up points of related posts, it is easy to see the gradual stalling of interest from SD1 to SD2 to SD3 as the project became increasingly less default-open:

<figure><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6d79af38-9313-4c6f-892d-f4df2853ca0a.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="image.png" draggable="false" contenteditable="false"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This was the last legacy of Emad's tenure at Stability - [the new management](https://stability.ai/news/stabilityai-announcement?ref=futuretools.io) must now figure out their path ahead on their own.

- **$600 Bounty for RetinaNet on MLPerf**: George Hotz announced a $600 bounty for implementing RetinaNet on MLPerf, doubling the bounty if it makes it into the MLPerf benchmark. He mentioned, "with ResNet/BERT in master, this bounty shouldn't be that hard."
- **Challenges with PyTorch Data Loading**: A member highlighted that most development time with PyTorch is spent on efficient data loading, particularly in HPC clusters. They suggested adopting solutions like [WebDataset](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset).
- **TinyGrad Data Loader Plan**: George Hotz proposed a simple API for TinyGrad's data loader that includes specifying a function to load records, shuffle buffer size, and batch size. He mentioned Comma's "gigashuffle" as an existing abstraction for reference.
- **TinyGrad 0.9.0 Update**: TinyGrad 0.9.0 has been added to the Nix repository, as per a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/316931). The update includes gpuctypes directly in the code base.
- **MLPerf and Publications**: MLPerf results are out, including tinybox red/green benchmarks. There was also a mention of a German article about TinyGrad on [Heise.de](https://www.heise.de/news/KI-Benchmark-MLPerf-Erste-AMD-Beschleuniger-mit-Minimalauftritt-9760531.html) and plans for a more detailed blog post to compare TinyGrad's speed to theoretical limits.

- **LLMs need grammar or JSON schemas for utility**: A member argued that **LLMs are largely useless** in an applied manner (agents) without grammar or JSON schemas as it forces the sampler to pick only from a subset of tokens, making the outputs parsable by an external program. This process improves utility in the application layer by standardizing output formats.
- **Simplify llamafile grammar usage**: Members discussed simplifying the use of `llamafile` with grammar options and pointed out the two-step process: invoking JSON schema to grammar and then consuming that grammar. One suggested the command `llamafile --grammar <(schemaify <foo.sql)`.
- **Packing ggml_cuda.so and ggml_rocm.so**: A user inquired about efficiently packing `ggml_cuda.so` and `ggml_rocm.so` into the llamafile release. Another member responded with a Bash script example and mentioned manual modifications are needed for AMD and tinyblas.
- **Use of magit for syncing**: To sync `llama.cpp`, a member shared that they use [Magit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urcL86UpqZc)—a popular Git interface within Emacs—illustrated humorously in a YouTube video titled "Interview with an Emacs Enthusiast in 2023 [Colorized]".

You want to use `ChatOpenAI`." [OpenAI Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions).
