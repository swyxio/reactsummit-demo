> AI News for 1/29/2025-1/30/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **34** Discords (**225** channels, and **7312** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **744 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

In a weird twist of fate, the VC backed Mistral ($1.4b raised to date) and the nonprofit AI2 released a small Apache 2 model and a large model today, but they are not in the order that you would expect to go in funding.

First, **Mistral Small 3**, released via their trademark [magnet link](https://x.com/mistralai/status/1884967826215059681?s=46), but thankfully also [blogpost](https://twitter.com/dchaplot/status/1884975427460206649):

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/cd4040a3-58ca-4099-aa33-53aa0dea68ab.png?w=960&fit=max)

A very nice 2025 update to Mistral's offering optimized for local inference - though one notices that the x axis of their efficiency chart is changing more quickly than the y axis. Internet sleuths have already [diffed](https://x.com/espadrine/status/1885004488206856638) the architectural differences from Mistral Small 2 (basically scaling up dimensionality but reducing layers and heads for latency):

Their passage on usecases is interesting information as to why they felt this worth releasing:

Next, AI2 released **Tülu 3 405B**, their large finetune of Llama 3 that uses their Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RVLR) recipe (from the [Tulu 3 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15124)) to make it competitive with DeepSeek v3 in some dimensions:

Unfortunately there don't seem to be any hosted APIs at launch, so it is hard to try out this [beeg](https://x.com/soldni/status/1885004141564731717) model.

**Theme 2. Nvidia Reduces FP8 Training on RTX 40/50 GPUs**

- **Nvidia cuts FP8 training performance in half on RTX 40 and 50 series GPUs** ([Score: 401, Comments: 93](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ideaxu/nvidia_cuts_fp8_training_performance_in_half_on/)): **Nvidia** has reportedly reduced **FP8 training performance** by half in the **RTX 40** and **50 series GPUs** according to their new Blackwell GPU architecture whitepaper, with the **4090** model showing a drop from **660.6 TFlops** to **330.3 TFlops** for FP8 with FP32 accumulate. This change may discourage AI/ML training on Geforce GPUs, reflecting a pattern of performance limiting since the Turing architecture while maintaining full performance for Quadro and datacenter GPUs.
  - Many commenters believe the reported halving of **FP8 training performance** in the **RTX 40 and 50 series GPUs** might be a typo in the documentation, referencing the **Ada Lovelace paper** where FP8/FP16 accumulation was confused with FP8/FP32. Some suggest testing with old and new drivers to verify if performance has indeed been altered.
  - There are accusations against **Nvidia** for engaging in anti-consumer practices, with references to **chip etching** and firmware limitations potentially used to restrict performance. Discussions include the possibility of legal actions, comparing this situation to previous cases like Apple's iPhone throttling settlement and Nvidia's GTX 970 false advertising fine.
  - Users highlight the importance of **CUDA** for machine learning tasks, noting difficulties encountered on non-Nvidia hardware like **Apple Silicon**.

- **OpenAI's Ethical Quandary with Deepseek**: It's considered wild that OpenAI highlights issues related to **Deepseek training**, especially given their history of using data from those they aim to place out of jobs.
   - Members expressed skepticism about OpenAI's legal claims and motivations to be seen as competent in a competitive field.
- **Exploring RL Method Benefits for LLM Tool Use**: There’s a realization that using **reinforcement learning (RL)** could minimize the need for extensive datasets by explaining tools briefly, allowing models to learn independently.
   - Concerns were raised about maintaining balance so LLMs do not become excessively reliant on specific tools.
- **Pythia Model's Sampling Probability**: Discussion revolves around the probability of sampling a trained **Pythia language model** from a Gaussian distribution, with acknowledgment of local volume estimation.
   - The concept of focusing on a 'neighborhood' around networks exhibiting specific behaviors was emphasized to refine the analysis.

> `Hyperfitting in LLMs, Critique Fine-Tuning, Backdoor Detection, Sampling Neural Networks, Generalization vs Memorization` 


- **Hyperfitting enhances LLM text generation**: Recent discussions highlighted that **hyperfitting** on a small dataset can significantly improve **open-ended text generation** capabilities of LLMs, counterintuitive to conventional wisdom.
   - For example, a model's human preference score climbed from **4.9%** to **34.3%**, putting it on par with larger models despite potential overfitting.
- **Introducing Critique Fine-Tuning**: Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) encourages models to learn from and critique noisy responses instead of only imitating correct ones, yielding consistent improvements in performance.
   - The method, validated on six math benchmarks, showed a **4-10%** improvement over traditional supervised fine-tuning.
- **Concerns on backdoor detection implications**: The ARC backdoor paper suggests that undetectably backdoored models can closely resemble their regular counterparts, leading to potential loss mismatches as models grow larger.
   - This raises questions about the effectiveness of loss functions in differentiating between backdoored and standard models.
- **Sampling techniques in neural networks**: Discussion around a proposed general-purpose **Absolute Unit NN** architecture examined how overall performance could be compromised due to scaling challenges.
   - Critics raised concerns about the practicality of this approach, particularly in terms of generalization versus memorization.
- **Evaluating CE-loss as a training metric**: There was consensus that using **cross-entropy loss** (CE-loss) as a training metric for LLM ability might not be adequate for measuring real-world performance.
   - Participants questioned why this metric remains in use, highlighting a lack of meaningful alternatives to assess model capabilities.

> `DeepSpeed training issues, Intermediate dimension adjustments for gated MLPs, Llama2 config parameters` 


- **Deleting torch_extensions to fix training issues**: A user suggested deleting the `torch_extensions` directory from the cache folder to resolve a training issue where loading the model prevents the training from starting, referencing [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/issues/2816).
   - This simple fix reportedly worked, indicating a potential solution for similar problems.
- **Setting Intermediate Dimensions in Gated MLPs**: One theory for configuring models with gated MLPs is to set the intermediate dimension to **3x** the desired value and then reset it during export to avoid issues with Hugging Face exports.
   - This workaround worked for two models tested, although the user acknowledges that further checks may be needed.
- **Llama2 Configuration Value Clarification**: The user noted that the **32768** value in the Llama2 config is unexplained and not divisible by **3**, which causes it to adjust to **11008** when considerations about the gated configurations are applied.
   - This insight is based on a reference to the [Llama2 config](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/blob/main/configs/llama2/7B.yml#L26) and the user is open to corrections on this understanding.
