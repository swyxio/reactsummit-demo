### ▷ #[general](https://discord.com/channels/1144547040454508606/1144547040928481394/) (39 messages🔥): 
        
- **Discussion on the Utility of Smaller Models**: `@theledgerluminary` questioned the value of using a complex architecture implementation with smaller models like the Mistral 7B, especially if the end-goal is to create an enterprise solution. This initiated a lively discussion and `@.tanuj.` argued for the benefits of being able to chain steps to solve complex problems, even offline, and using different models for various tasks.

- **Fine-Tuning Small Models vs Using Base Models for Tasks**: `@theledgerluminary` suggested that fine-tuning a community of specific small models, including one for orchestration, could yield great results, but using a base model for large tasks seemed less adequate. `@.tanuj.` countered, stating that the act of fine-tuning models may be more challenging than creating a reasoning "agent" that utilizes the Locally Linear Model (LLM) queries to solve tasks.

- **Hybrid Approach for Enterprise Solution Design**: The idea of taking a hybrid approach to design was proposed by `@superseethat`. The approach includes developing an "agent swarm architecture" with specialization in mind and then fine-tuning one specialization at a time.

- **Views on LLM Agents**: User comments varied on the utility of LLM agents. `@jessicant.` brought up the point that LLM fine-tuning could potentially improve program reliability, especially for tasks requiring multi-turn conversations. However, `@sublimatorniq` expressed doubts about the feasibility of GPT-4 agents beyond toy applications.

- **Customization of the Agent Framework**: `@.tanuj.` discussed the benefits of customizing the agent framework to be robust to any type of model, allowing for consistent chaining of requests on any model that respects a contract. This user also provided an [example](https://github.com/TanGentleman/microchain) of function calling-based LLM agents. The limitations of Transparent, Freeform, and English Instructions were also discussed, showing preference for more manually fine-tuned control.

- **Discussion on Chaining LLM outputs with Defined Function Call**: User `@.tanuj.` proposed the idea of an LLM that can chain function calls in a step-by-step manner, providing detailed outputs. The discussion involved conceptualizing a "ResearchGPT" model that had features/functions such as GoogleSearch, EvaluateSources, CreateEssay, DeployWebsite, etc. `@poltronsuperstar` acknowledged its potential real-life applications.
- **Using "Instruct" over "Base" Model for Querying**: `@.gue22` gave feedback that **Mistral Instruct 7B v0.2 Q8** yielded better answers to the user's queries over its base model. `@.gue22` also shared a detailed way to determine if an app is written for x86 or ARM architecture on Apple Silicon Macs, which was generated by the instructed model. `@.tanuj.` suggested filling more of the instruct model's 32K window and providing examples for better results.
- **Recommendations on Other Models**: `@fayiron` advised `@.gue22` to try **Mixtral**, **Qwen**, or a **Yi finetune** (e.g., nous-hermes 2 yi 34b) due to their setup. After this suggestion, `.gue22` started a download for the Nous Hermes 2 Yi 34B model from Hugging Face for further evaluation.
- **Discussion on App Architecture Checking Methods for Apple Silicon Macs**: `@.tanuj.` mentioned a quicker way to check whether an application is built for Apple Silicon - by looking at the processes running in the Activity Monitor and checking for a tag saying "Apple".

- **Tokenization of Chinese Characters**: `@poltronsuperstar` remarked that Chinese characters often use two tokens due to Unicode encoding. Alternatively, `@.tanuj.` suggested using the `MistralAI` library in Python which includes token usage in the response object, or direct messaging for assistance with tokenizing Chinese characters.

- **Community Discussion - AGI's First Query**: `@poltronsuperstar` initiated a discussion asking other members what they would first ask an AGI. Responses varied, with `@sublimatorniq`'s question addressing AI consciousness and `@kdawgdfw` suggesting a leisurely topic: “So, what do you do for fun? Any hobbies?”

- **Open Letter to OpenAI from VERSES** : `@poltronsuperstar` shared a [blog post](https://www.verses.ai/blogs/science-and-standards-behind-the-breakthrough) by VERSES. In an open letter to OpenAI, VERSES appealed to assist their path to AGI development, indicating concerns over the current mainstream path relying on deep learning and large language models.

- **Implications of VERSES' Approach**: Reactions to the blog post were mixed. `@daain` commented that the idea sounded intuitively good, but its efficient implementation is yet to be seen. They also pointed out the invocation of an OpenAI clause about assisting competing AGI developments as a clever PR move, and shared a [link](https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/) to similar ideas in the past. In response, `@poltronsuperstar` mentioned that without a demo, such claims don't hold much value.

- **Issues with Mistral-Medium for DPO dataset creation**: `@jaredquek` reported that while generating a DPO dataset, he found **Mistral-Medium** kept providing unnecessary explanations for inferior responses, which contradicts its intent of omitting such explanations. [Prompt engineering](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Prompt_Engineering.md) attempts to correct this issue were not successful.
- **Poor Instruction Following**: `@alimsss` hinted that the model's competency in following instructions is underwhelming, though a few shots can partially fix this behavior.
- **Attempt to Structure Model Outputs**: `@casper_ai` discussed a technique of generating a specific output structure from models, which can later be parsed with regex. He also suggested that **GPT-4 32k 0613** is efficient in producing such structured outputs.
- **Effects of JSON instruction on AI Reasoning Capabilities**: `@jaredquek` and `@casper_ai` had a discussion about whether instructing models in JSON format limits their reasoning capabilities. `@casper_ai` argued that using JSON may limit the models considering JSON might comprise only a small portion of their pretraining data. 
- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: `.superintendent` is considering generating a synthetic dataset and looking for a time with low demand to avoid worsening the current high traffic.

- **Discussion on Chatbot Architecture**: User `@JH` provided an in-depth explanation of the architectural differences between **ChatGPT**, **SD**, and **SDXL** models. According to them, ChatGPT primarily uses a casual decoding transformer that performs inference based on next token prediction tasks. On the other end, SD models primarily use a convolutional U-Net architecture, inputting output embeddings from Clip L for **SD v1** and from Clip L + openClip G for **SDXL**. The U-Net architecture incorporates cross attention layers and self attention layers, trained via variational lower bound loss and a noise prediction loss. Lastly, `@JH` deems it is reasonable to expect these different architectures to learn concepts differently due to their distinct objectives.

- **Benchmark for Context Retrieval**: `@rasdani` expressed an interest in creating a **benchmark for context retrieval**, based on deepset/germanquad. The plan is to select 60 question/context pairs from the test set, pairing half with irrelevant contexts, and using 0 and 1 as ground truth for cosine similarity. The aim of the benchmark is to compare different embedding models and calculate pairwise correlations.
- **Dot Product vs Cosine Similarity**: `@philipmay` advised that the **dot product is more effective than cosine similarity** when using semantic embeddings for questions and passages. This tip was originally provided to them by Nils Reimers, who they consider an expert in embeddings.
- **Metrics for Retrieval Systems**: In response to a conversation about retrieval system metrics, `@philipmay` stated that MRR@10 is often used, while `@hammadkhan` noted that the MTEB leaderboard uses NDCG@10, which assesses the quality of retrieval based on relevance and position within the top 10 items.  
- **Data Sets for Multiple Positive Contexts**: `@rasdani` asked for recommendations of contextual QA datasets with multiple positive contexts in German, as they are planning to use MRR@10 for their benchmark due to having only one positive reference context per question in germanquad.
- **New Year Greetings**: `@bjoernp` and `@thewindmom` greeted the members of the discord server and expressed their anticipation for future developments.
