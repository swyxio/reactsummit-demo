### **Eleuther ▷ #[general](https://discord.com/channels/729741769192767510/729741769738158194/1295532010550595595)** (26 messages🔥): 

> - `Gradient Accumulation Bug Fix`
> - `Difference Between Base and Instruct Models`
> - `Normalization in Cross Entropy Loss` 


- **Gradient Accumulation Bug Fix Announced**: A fix has been implemented for a bug causing all training losses to diverge with large gradient accumulation sizes, impacting libraries that utilize this method. This issue was linked to the cross entropy loss normalizer and required denormalizing to match training loss curves.
   - Further details on this fix can be found in a [blog post here](http://unsloth.ai/blog/gradient) and users are encouraged to update to the latest version.
- **Discussion on Partial Batch Weighting Mistakes**: It was highlighted that accidentally upweighing partial batches due to normalization issues in cross entropy could lead to significant divergence in training losses. This is especially true in cases where padding affects loss calculations.
   - Members suggested changing the wording of the bug description to clarify that it particularly affects losses that use mean reduction and padding in PyTorch.
- **Impacts of Sequence Length on Loss Calculation**: Concerns were raised regarding how shorter sequence lengths get weighted more heavily compared to longer ones when using improper normalization strategies. This can lead to further divergence of losses, especially when ignoring input token losses.
- **Normalization Practices Under Scrutiny**: A user commented on their practice of implementing correct normalization in their code and noted that poor normalization strategies were common. They pointed out that averaging by the number of unmasked positions for ragged batches often leads to issues.

> - `QKNorm Effectiveness`
> - `ReLU^2 Performance`
> - `Impact of Sequence Length on Loss`
> - `Local vs. Global Attention`
> - `MoE Sparse Computation` 


- **QKNorm's Stability Concerns**: QKNorm did not perform well during tests on a tight baseline, resulting in 'weak attention' after training, raising questions about its effectiveness in larger models.
   - Despite this, it was utilized in the Olmoe project, suggesting potential internal disagreements about its design choices.
- **ReLU^2's Limited Improvement**: While ReLU^2 was found to bring only a 4% improvement in specific tests, its use in larger models raises concerns whether the performance gain justifies its implementation.
   - The comparison of ReLU^2's performance against GELU and other gating mechanisms reflects ongoing discourse about activation functions in large-scale deployments.
- **Comparing Models with Different Sequence Lengths**: When evaluating models trained on different sequence lengths, it's crucial to match the evaluation sequence length to ensure fair comparisons.
   - Longer sequence lengths may yield better training loss results, but evaluation at consistent lengths helps determine the true efficacy of the model.
- **Local vs. Global Attention Dynamics**: Local attention mechanisms can exhibit greater instability at deeper layers, while global attention maintains consistent gradient propagation regardless of depth.
   - This distinction may contribute to the varying effectiveness of attention strategies in different model architectures.
- **Exploring MoE for Sparse Computation**: The discussion on using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for sparse computation highlighted its potential advantages and the need for careful implementation to avoid instability.
   - This method opens up new possibilities for dynamic model architectures, such as generating weights on-the-fly, which could represent a significant advance in the field.

> - `Importance of good baselines`
> - `Misleading performance improvements`
> - `Impact of tuning on results`
> - `Utility of LLM papers` 


- **Critique of Optimization-Focused Papers**: Members agreed that they weigh results from optimization-focused papers less if they show a lack of knowledge in optimization basics or are tied to untuned hyperparameters.
   - Such papers are generally deemed less informative or even discarded based on the severity of their errors.
- **Baselines as Key Indicators**: A lack of a good learning rate or baseline is seen as a significant impediment to evaluating model performance.
   - Papers with untuned baselines are only deemed valuable if they show extreme performance deviations.
- **Watch Out for Misleading Claims**: "X improved performance" can imply only marginal stability improvements rather than genuine advancements, especially in poorly executed experiments.
   - Such claims can obscure the actual effectiveness of a model modification.
- **The A/B Result Dilemma in LLM Research**: Several members commented that many LLM papers often yield results that are merely A/B comparisons rather than substantive performance enhancements.
   - This can create a scenario where many papers are deemed nearly useless, allowing researchers to disregard the majority of findings.
- **Mamba Layers and Positional Encodings**: Discussion revealed that mamba layers do not benefit from positional encodings, demonstrating another layer of complexity in model evaluations.
   - This reflects a broader issue of understanding what modifications contribute to genuine improvements versus those that mask underlying instabilities.

   - If the model outputs an empty string or an un-decodable response, it signifies the end of the current turn.
- **Model's Ability to Properly Stop**: A member highlighted the significance of the model’s ability to correctly determine when to stop outputting function calls, particularly when the model believes it has completed a task.
   - *In some sense, yes, but not necessarily,* was the response, indicating that the model can output nothing to signal the end of a turn.
- **Example of Weather Inquiry Interaction**: A detailed scenario was given where the model processes a weather-related request using function calls like `get_coordinate` and `get_weather`, returning necessary data at each step.
   - The conversation demonstrates that the model's output of a sentence post-data retrieval cannot be decoded and thus results in the termination of that interaction turn.
- **Function Call Output Variability**: The model can express the need to stop or make additional function calls in various ways, including choosing to output nothing at all.
   - This variability reflects different approaches taken by prompting models to manage user queries effectively.
