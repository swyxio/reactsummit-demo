# AI Twitter Recap

**OpenAI’s GPT‑5.1 rollout: adaptive reasoning, dev-focused API, and new UX pilots**

- **Adaptive reasoning + developer focus**: OpenAI shipped GPT‑5.1 with “adaptive reasoning” for 5.1‑Instant, a change that required novel post-training/RL work, per [@allisontam_](https://twitter.com/allisontam_/status/1989138927970848936). On the platform side, OpenAI emphasized better dev ergonomics: “excellent new models in our API and extended prompt caching,” per [@gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1989135114744573993). The team also published concrete guidance for long-running/agentic tasks (plan tools, persistence), and a Prompt Optimizer, including a toggle for reasoning_effort to trade off latency/cost vs quality, via [OpenAI DevRel](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1989378869976326570), [tip 2](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1989378875126886560), [tip 3](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1989378876922077560). Separately, OpenAI is piloting “group chats” with ChatGPT in Japan, NZ, South Korea, and Taiwan ([announcement](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1989138776585851038)).
- **Measured deltas on benchmarks and UX**: Independent tracker Artificial Analysis finds GPT‑5.1 is a “minor” intelligence bump over GPT‑5 (+2 on their index), driven largely by a +12pp gain on TerminalBench (agentic coding/terminal use). Non‑reasoning endpoint shows no change; pricing is unchanged and slightly more token‑efficient, per [@ArtificialAnlys](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1989417492582899872). Anecdotally, GPT‑5.1 is better at creative writing ([@gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1989230190111912041)) and code (try 5.1‑Codex: [@gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1989226363069559173); live tests in VS Code: [@JamesMontemagno](https://twitter.com/JamesMontemagno/status/1989354367343075697)). Steerability also improved in small but visible ways (e.g., respecting custom instruction style constraints), per [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1989193813043069219).

**Anthropic/Claude: structured outputs land; Claude Code momentum; Opus 4.5 rumor debunk**

- **Structured Outputs (public beta)**: Claude API now guarantees JSON schema/tool-conformant responses without retries/parsing hacks, initially for Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 (Haiku 4.5 soon). Docs and API examples via [@alexalbert__](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1989409186674098595) and [follow‑up](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1989409198971801905). Long‑time users note this unifies prior “single tool with schema” recipes ([@simonw](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1989411809351303430)).
- **Claude Code for agent ops**: Builders highlight Claude Code’s effectiveness at optimizing agent workflows when given logs/test scripts and a tight harness—less tooling, more code execution and clear specs ([@omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1989417433245925645); “Pulse” proactive research agent: [demo](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1989350215175020682)). Community sentiment remains that Opus 4.1 is still hard to beat for general quality ([@abacaj](https://twitter.com/abacaj/status/1989128220835537315)).
- **Rumor control**: “Opus 4.5” references found in a Claude Code CLI PR appear to be autocomplete/date artifacts, not a stealth release ([@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1989145846114578547), [1](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1989145863508394059), [2](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1989146991272817048)).

- **Trust and control in agent UX**: Perplexity’s Comet Assistant now pauses before sensitive actions (logins/purchases), shows traces, and requires explicit permission—an example of permissioned “digital employee” patterns for agentic browsing ([@perplexity_ai](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1989416343331012971)).
- **Agentic coding platforms**: Cline added direct support for Nous’ Hermes 4 70B/405B across VS Code, JetBrains, and CLI ([@NousResearch](https://twitter.com/NousResearch/status/1989427241424654534); [@cline](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1989432694867193988)).

**Dev tools and infra: repo QA, coding agents, and experiment plumbing**

- **Repo‑aware code QA**: Google’s “CodeWiki” lets you query codebases in natural language (function locations, architecture, logic) and performed well on the DSPy repo in community tests ([@getpy](https://twitter.com/getpy/status/1989237111745310770)).
- **Qwen Code v0.2.1**: Fast iteration (8 releases in 17 days) delivering: free web search (multi‑provider; 2,000/day for OAuth users), fuzzy matching to reduce retries/token usage, plain‑text tool responses (less schema brittleness), Zed IDE improvements, smarter file filtering and `.gitignore` respect, Unicode fixes, and performance optimizations ([@Alibaba_Qwen](https://twitter.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/1989368317011009901)).
- **Experiment ops**: SkyPilot now natively integrates with Weights & Biases for multi‑cloud/K8s launches, failure recovery, and collaborative tracking ([@skypilot_org](https://twitter.com/skypilot_org/status/1989377870469501106)); W&B also shipped LEET, a terminal UI for runs/metrics/system health ([clip](https://twitter.com/wandb/status/1989403717305827660)).
- **IDE/runtime niceties**: VS Code gaining inline terminal output for failed commands in chat flows ([@Tyriar](https://twitter.com/Tyriar/status/1989439441971396952)); Colab↔VS Code integration momentum visible at events ([@patloeber](https://twitter.com/patloeber/status/1989332433301324031)). On the infra side, Dojo now supports the OpenEnv spec ([@chakra_ai](https://twitter.com/chakra_ai/status/1989377867965513880)), and engineers continue reporting solid speedups with CUDA Graphs (with caveats) while cautioning against misuse of `record_stream` ([@maharshii](https://twitter.com/maharshii/status/1989375005231362428), [@vikhyatk](https://twitter.com/vikhyatk/status/1989217613873021241)).

**Research and evals to watch: depth, audio‑language, interpretability, and on‑policy training**

- **Depth Anything 3 (DA3)**: Aiming for human‑like spatial perception across single/multi‑view and video using minimalism: a plain transformer (e.g., DINO) and a single depth‑ray representation suffice for broad generalization. Multiple series released (main DA3, monocular metric, monocular depth). App/demo and paper threads here: [@bingyikang](https://twitter.com/bingyikang/status/1989358267668336841), [@_akhaliq](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1989336687529619858).

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Performance Comparison of Llama.cpp on Windows vs Linux

- [**Windows llama.cpp is 20% faster**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1owskm6/windows_llamacpp_is_20_faster/) (Activity: 363): **The post discusses a performance comparison between Windows and Linux when running** `llama.cpp`**, specifically using the Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Instruct model. The benchmark results show that Windows, utilizing the AMD proprietary driver, achieves higher performance across various parameters (pp512, pp1024, pp2048, pp4096) compared to Linux, which uses the RADV driver. A key factor contributing to this performance difference is the support for** `bf16` **(bfloat16) on Windows, which is not yet available on Linux. Additionally, the shared memory size is detected differently between the two systems, potentially affecting performance.** Commenters highlight the significance of `bf16` support in the performance disparity and note that Linux's lack of `bf16` support is a disadvantage. There is also a discussion about the shared memory size detection and its impact on performance, with a link to a potential future update for Linux drivers.
    - The introduction of `bf16` support is highlighted as a significant factor in the performance improvement of `llama.cpp` on Windows. This support is expected to be available on more machines next year, as indicated by the [Phoronix article](https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-BF16-For-LLVM-SPIR-V).
    - A technical point is raised about the detection of shared memory size, which is handled differently on Windows compared to Linux. Additionally, it's noted that the Linux driver currently lacks `bf16` support, which could impact performance.
    - A user questions the choice of using Vulkan over `hipBLAS`, suggesting that `hipBLAS` could offer higher performance on both Windows and Linux platforms. This implies a potential area for optimization in the implementation of `llama.cpp`.
- [**Is it normal to hear weird noises when running an LLM on 4× Pro 6000 Max-Q cards?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1owocd2/is_it_normal_to_hear_weird_noises_when_running_an/) (Activity: 873): **Running a large language model (LLM) like** `gpt-oss-120b` **on multiple high-performance GPUs such as** `4× Pro 6000 Max-Q` **can lead to unusual noises, often attributed to coil whine. This phenomenon occurs due to the electrical components vibrating at certain frequencies under heavy load, which can vary with different models and workloads. The noise is generally harmless but can be more pronounced with specific hardware configurations and computational tasks.** Commenters generally agree that the noise is likely coil whine, a common occurrence with high-performance GPUs under load. Some users note that the sound can vary between setups and even find it somewhat enjoyable.

Anthropic caught them and is telling everyone how they did it.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ox361v/china_just_used_claude_to_hack_30_companies_the/) (Activity: 901): **In September 2025, Anthropic identified a cyberattack orchestrated by Chinese state-sponsored hackers using their AI, Claude. The attack targeted approximately** `30` **companies, including tech firms, banks, and government agencies, with the AI performing** `80-90%` **of the hacking tasks autonomously. The hackers bypassed Claude's safety protocols by breaking the attack into innocuous tasks and misleading the AI into believing it was conducting legitimate cybersecurity testing. This incident is noted as the first large-scale cyberattack executed with minimal human intervention, highlighting a significant evolution in AI's role in cybersecurity threats. For more details, see the [Anthropic report](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf).** Some commenters suggest the report may serve as a marketing strategy for Anthropic, emphasizing their 'security first' approach, while others criticize the report's quality, implying it might have been AI-generated.
    - NoteAnxious725 highlights a sophisticated attack pattern where the AI model, Claude, was manipulated to perform tasks that contributed to a security breach. The attackers disguised their true intentions by breaking down the intrusion into benign-sounding subtasks, which the model executed without realizing the offensive nature. This method allowed 90% of the campaign to be automated without altering the model's weights. The comment emphasizes the need for independent, offline audits to prevent such misuse, as current guardrails only detect 'innocent' tasks and fail to see the bigger picture.
- [**Polymarket now has a market for Sam Altman going to jail**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1owv8ev/polymarket_now_has_a_market_for_sam_altman_going/) (Activity: 700): **The image depicts a market on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, where users can speculate on the likelihood of Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, going to jail by specific future dates. The market offers two outcomes with probabilities of** `2%` **and** `6%` **for December 31, 2025, and June 30, 2026, respectively. This setup allows users to buy shares in either outcome, effectively betting on the event's occurrence, with a total market volume of** `$15,147`**. Such markets are often used to gauge public sentiment or perceived risk regarding high-profile individuals.** One commenter suggests that investing in the 'No' outcome could yield a guaranteed `8%` return, reflecting a belief in the low probability of Altman's incarceration. Another comment highlights skepticism about the likelihood of billionaires facing jail time, questioning the rationale behind betting 'Yes'.

- **Parameter Tweaks Trump Seeds**: A member noted that model parameters can influence output in addition to seed, suggesting that differences in configuration could explain variations in results and offered a possible explanation to others.
   - In response to this, another member expressed gratitude and indicated they would investigate further, specifically looking at the chat template and auto-generated modelfile with Ollama.
- **Fine-Tune or Lora? The eternal Question!**: One user asked how much memory is needed to fully fine-tune **GPT-OSS-120B** and how much is needed for Lora, noting that they could probably fit Lora within **128GB**.
   - An expert replied that there is no single answer, it all depends on the goal, dataset, and other factors but in general lora is sufficient for that in most cases.
- **Debate About Lora Myth Debunked**: One of the discord users, who wanted to tune for a pretty narrow task, was warned against the Lora approach for not teaching new knowledge.
   - However, the expert countered that *there's a myth you can't teach new knowledge using lora, that's incorrect* and also it helps to preserve the original model's knowledge as well.
- **8GB GPU Owners Rejoice Qwen-VL!**: A user asked if it's feasible to train **3 VL 8B** in **4-bit** mode on an **8GB GPU RTX 4060**, which another replied affirmatively *um might just fit if your eluckydid you try our colab notebook? See how much VRAM it uses there*
   - The expert added that even with **16GB VRAM Tesla T4s** on Google Colab, only **15GB VRAM** is actually available because the rest is used for the *driver overhead, operating system, Pytorch, and memory fragmentation*.
- **Unsloth VLM RL Colab Crash!**: Users reported encountering the same error when running the **Gemma-3-4B** Unsloth inference Colab for Vision RL, as well as the **Qwen3-VL-2B** and **-4B** models, pointing to the 2025.11.3 version as the culprit.
   - The support team suggested that if running the GitHub version, the best practice is to run the same for **zoo**; if running **pypi** on both, you shouldn't see the **tiled mlp error**.

- **GPU Power Spikes Debated**: Members discussed GPU power consumption, noting that GPUs have power spikes, but undervolting or power limiting can mitigate issues without significant performance loss, suggesting the [Sapphire NITRO+ Radeon RX 9070](https://www.sapphiretech.com/en/consumer/nitro-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-24g-gddr6) draws 245W compared to the typical 220W.
   - It was mentioned that exceeding PSU capacity will cause a shutdown rather than a fire, unless using cheaply made PSUs, and that a typical GPU draws **220W**, not **300W**.
- **Uneven GPU Pairing Hinders Perf**: A discussion clarified that mixing GPUs results in performance closer to the slower card, such as a **5050**, but combining **two 9700s** doubles VRAM to 32GB, allowing larger models but performing slightly worse than a single 32GB card with the same core.
   - It was noted that each GPU consumes its maximum allowed power (e.g., 220W each).
- **Linux CUDA vs Windows CUDA**: A member reported that CUDA on Linux splits **KV-cache** evenly, unlike on Windows, and mentioned their LLM server SSD died due to running out of disk space during a Windows update.
   - Another member humorously described Linux overscan issues as a consequence of *all WM's being CRAP*.
- **NV-Link Debunked for Interference**: Members debated the utility of NV-Link for inference, with one stating that *NV-Links don't help performance* based on research, while another specified they are only getting one for training purposes.
   - This point was further corroborated with the point that NV-Links do not help interference speeds.
- **Turing Architecture's Fading Memory**: A member shared their experience with a **72GB Turing array**, noting performance degradation around 45k context, dropping from ~30 tps to 20 tps, while their 128GB Ampere array shows a more gradual decline from ~60 tps.
   - This suggests that for new purchases, **Turing** should cost half as much as an equivalent **Ampere** VRAM purchase.

> `Helion Autotuning, Helion Configs, Helion Interpret Mode, Config Requirements` 


- **`kernel.autotune` For Helion**: Members discussed Helion's autotuning capabilities, noting that ``@helion.kernel(configs=[a, b, c])`` will run configs **a, b, c** and pick the fastest, similar to the Triton autotuner.
   - It was suggested that using `FiniteSearch` directly would allow returning the chosen config.
- **Retrieving Helion Kernel Configs**: To programmatically access the config chosen after running a function annotated with `helion.kernel`, it was suggested that doing something like `helion_rms_norm_fwd.bind((x, w, eps))._config` would work.
   - This allows using the `_config` from one set to autotune a second set of configs.
- **Helion's interpret mode is fast**: It was highlighted that Helion's interpret mode is really fast because it runs the entire code as if there were no tiles, using eager PyTorch.
   - Abstracting out the tiles enables performance *"portability"*, unlike Triton where tile sizes make it slow.
- **Configs validity and input dimensionality**: For config validity across different inputs, there isn't a hard set rule, but if inputs have the same number of dimensions, it should work.
   - The exception is when using Optional[tensor] as an input type, which breaks this pattern.

- ****GPU Thread Management: Avoiding Scheduling Overload****: Members discussed best practices for GPU thread management, noting that launching too many threads (e.g., 1 million) can lead to **scheduling overhead**.
   - It was suggested to **limit threads to `(warp/wavefront width) * (max occupancy per sm) * (sm count)`** and have each thread do more work beyond that limit, treating the GPU as a vector processor to avoid abstractions.
- ****MAX: A Graph Compiler for Performance Optimization****: A graph compiler was highlighted as an approach to optimize performance, especially when the shape of the hardware or program assembly isn't known ahead of time.
   - A member said that MAX can figure out *how many warps to launch for this GPU in particular* and is useful for connecting kernels sequentially in algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms
- ****Alternatives to `always_inline("builtin")` and `@comptime` Decorator Considered****: The team is considering removing `always_inline("builtin")` and limiting its use to the standard library.
   - A member suggested replacing it with a `@comptime` decorator that indicates it should be folded predictably at compile time
