It is perhaps too coincidental that, the week after Dario Amodei stressed [the Urgency of Interpretability,](https://www.darioamodei.com/post/the-urgency-of-interpretability) ChatGPT shipped an update that was so roundly hated it had to offer an [official retraction overnight](https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/), saying "*we focused too much on short-term feedback, and did not fully account for how users’ interactions with ChatGPT evolve over time*". Joanne Jang of the Model Spec even did [a rare Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kbjowz/ama_with_openais_joanne_jang_head_of_model/) sharing a little detail on their learnings:

Elsewhere on AI Twitter, the growing dissatistfaction with LMArena (after [a rough Llama 4 weekend](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-llama-4s-controversial-weekend-release/)) came to a head as a group of researchers who primarily work at Cohere [published a paper documenting](https://x.com/arankomatsuzaki/status/1917400711882797144?s=46) unfair practices favoring big incumbents like OpenAI, DeepMind, [X.ai](http://x.ai/) and Meta.

They gave LMArena a heads up and [they have responded,](https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1917492084359192890) but the [damage is done](https://x.com/maximelabonne/status/1917563456632328508) and there is officially an appetite for [alternatives](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1917546757929722115). Fortunately, the paper comes with actionable recommendations that LMArena can consider to restore confidence.

Another commenter notes performance as high as 4.5 tokens/sec on a Raspberry Pi-class device, highlighting the efficiency gains from aggressive quantization and CPU inference optimizations. There are questions about how the system handles running a quantized model that exceeds available RAM, especially on Windows, and whether paging or memory mapping is being utilized under the hood.** Technical comparisons are being raised regarding coding performance relative to Qwen2.5-Coding-14B and Mistral Small 3 24B in similar quantization settings, with concerns about the trade-off between throughput and model quality for practical agentic workflows.
    - Several users question running Qwen3-30B-A3B Q4 GGUF weights on a 16GB RAM machine, since the quantized model reportedly exceeds 17GB, raising doubts about memory mapping or possible use of advanced quantization techniques (e.g., Bartowski or Unsloth). Specifics on how Windows manages this or whether swap/virtual memory is leveraged are requested.
    - Performance on low-end hardware is discussed, with one report of running similar models at over 4.5 tokens/sec on a Raspberry Pi clone. Another user estimates Qwen3-30B-A3B could reach 6 tokens/sec on an Intel N100 PC (single-channel, Q4/Q6), emphasizing practical throughput for agentic-chain use cases and coding tasks.
    - Comparisons to models like Qwen2.5-Coding-14B and Mistral Small 3 24B are solicited, with users reporting borderline-acceptable performance from Qwen2.5-Coding-14B at Q4/Q6 on similar hardware. For Qwen3-30B-A3B to be practical, it must at least match or outperform these models under constrained conditions.
- [**Qwen3-30B-A3B is on another level (Appreciation Post)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kbkv2d/qwen330ba3b_is_on_another_level_appreciation_post/) ([Score: 141, Comments: 63](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kbkv2d/qwen330ba3b_is_on_another_level_appreciation_post/)): **The OP reports that the Qwen3-30B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf LLM (32K context, ~8K max output) delivers consistently high throughput (95 tokens/sec on a Ryzen 7 7700 + RTX 3090) when run locally in KoboldCPP on Windows 11. The user found the 4K_M variant buggy (infinite loop), but notes the UD-Q4_K_XL quantization is stable and markedly superior in usability to other local models, prompting them to delete all others. Notable implementation details include compatibility with consumer hardware and seamless 24/7 uptime for general NLP tasks; the model's *speed and efficiency* reportedly alleviate hardware FOMO and reliance on cloud models like ChatGPT.**  Technical commentary emphasizes the significant performance leap of the Qwen3-30B-A3B MoE model over comparably-sized (32B) models, especially for coding and writing. Commenters underscore its capability for broader use cases with additional finetuning and note its practicality for local inference even in full precision on MacBook (M4 Max, 128GB RAM), highlighting transformative usability.
    - Qwen3-30B-A3B's coding and writing capabilities surpass those of the Qwen3-32B, especially when combined with fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG); users highlight the model's effectiveness in practical tasks well beyond other small LLMs, indicating its MoE (Mixture of Experts) approach brings significant real-world benefits.
    - Performance benchmarks show Qwen3-30B-A3B achieving `17.7 tokens/sec` generation speed on an AMD 7900 GRE 16GB GPU, using the Q6_K_L quantized model with llama.cpp and Open-WebUI on Windows 11, making it suitable for workflow integration and demanding tasks such as automating programming with minimal documentation sources.
    - Users report that Qwen3-30B-A3B enables full-precision inference at usable speeds even on consumer hardware (e.g., MacBook with 128GB M4 Max), underscoring improved efficiency and accessibility for local inference compared to previous models.
- [**Qwen3:4b runs on my 3.5 years old Pixel 6 phone**](https://i.redd.it/zbzcq79ihzxe1.jpeg) ([Score: 273, Comments: 36](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kbi47j/qwen34b_runs_on_my_35_years_old_pixel_6_phone/)): **The image demonstrates the successful execution of the Qwen3:4b large language model on a 3.5-year-old Google Pixel 6 smartphone using the Ollama framework. The terminal output confirms the model both loads and responds interactively, albeit slowly, revealing the practical feasibility of running advanced LLMs locally and offline on consumer-grade mobile hardware. System logs displayed in the image indicate the device's CPU and memory usage during inference, providing technical insight into the resource demands for such on-device execution.** Commenters elaborate that Ollama's performance on mobile is suboptimal compared to compiling llama.cpp with OpenBLAS, suggesting a potential `~70% better performance` for CPU-only environments. Others discuss alternative backends like Vulkan, performance metrics (tokens per second), and the detailed nature of the model's outputs even for simple prompts.
    - A user reports that running Qwen3:4b via Ollama on mobile is very slow, but compiling llama.cpp with the OpenBLAS backend yields approximately `~70%` better CPU-only performance compared to Ollama. They note that this optimization makes the model usable locally when it was otherwise impractically slow.
    - The user also mentions that Termux, a terminal emulator for Android, now offers a Vulkan backend for llama.cpp (`pkg install llama-cpp-backend-vulkan`). This potentially enables hardware-accelerated performance by leveraging the phone's GPU, and the user is in the process of testing its effectiveness.
- [**Technically Correct, Qwen 3 working hard**](https://i.redd.it/dudbg02v9vxe1.png) ([Score: 755, Comments: 96](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kb3gox/technically_correct_qwen_3_working_hard/)): **The image documents a user requesting Qwen 3, an AI model, to explain how to solve a Rubik's cube. Qwen 3 processes the request and responds simply with 'Yes' after 15.5 seconds, indicating it recognizes and can fulfill the problem-solving or instructional query but does not give detailed guidance in its answer. This interaction reflects on the model's task comprehension and its minimalistic, perhaps overly succinct, response behavior, potentially as a result of response length or prompt interpretation algorithms.** Commenters debate the utility of such brevity, with one preferring the short affirmation over a long-winded, unhelpful explanation with the actual answer obscured.

### 2. DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and JetBrains Mellum Model Releases

- [**DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B is released**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kbbt74/deepseekproverv2671b_is_released/) ([Score: 136, Comments: 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kbbt74/deepseekproverv2671b_is_released/)): **DeepSeek has released the DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B model on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B). This model, with** `671B` **(billion) parameters, is described as an 'open source alpha proof', indicating an early public release. Technical details such as its architecture, training dataset, benchmarks, or evaluation results are not included in the announcement post.** Commenters are interested in distilled (smaller, more efficient) versions and inquire about the model's intended use case, but no deep technical debate is present.
    - There is interest in the potential for distilled versions of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, suggesting anticipation for more efficient or smaller variants optimized for deployment or resource-constrained scenarios, which is a common industry practice to maintain performance while reducing model size.
- [**deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B · Hugging Face**](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B) ([Score: 252, Comments: 27](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kbbcp8/deepseekaideepseekproverv2671b_hugging_face/)): **DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, presumably a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for formal mathematical proof generation in Lean, was recently released on Hugging Face, but technical details from the page are inaccessible due to rate limiting. Discussion notes the domain-specific expertise required for practical use—competence in using the Lean theorem prover—and references an alternative model, DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera, available for free on OpenRouter.** Commenters highlight the challenge of using theorem-proving models due to the steep learning curve of Lean, and suggest mainstream adoption is limited by this barrier. Another model, DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera, was recommended as notable but under-publicized.
    - A technical comment highlights how DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B is targeted at users familiar with proof assistants like Lean. It notes the significant barrier to entry, pointing out that while mathematicians might be able to write proofs on paper, expressing them formally in Lean is considerably more complex. This implies the model's practical audience is restricted to those with advanced familiarity with both formal methods and tooling.
    - Comparison is drawn to another model, [DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera](https://huggingface.co/tngtech/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera), which has been freely available on OpenRouter. The mention suggests that DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera is a potentially overlooked alternative in this computational proof domain, and implies some interest in benchmarking or feature comparisons between these models.
    - A comment identifies hardware requirements as a practical consideration for running large-scale models like DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, specifically wishing for access to a "M3 Ultra 512GB or a Intel Xeon with AMX instructions". This underscores the high computational and memory demands typical for state-of-the-art formal reasoning models and may guide expectations for potential users regarding infrastructure needs.
- [**Jetbrains opensourced their Mellum model**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kbfhxx/jetbrains_opensourced_their_mellum_model/) ([Score: 115, Comments: 24](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kbfhxx/jetbrains_opensourced_their_mellum_model/)): **JetBrains has open-sourced their Mellum model, a 4B-parameter LLM optimized for code, now available on Hugging Face ([Mellum-4b-base](https://huggingface.co/JetBrains/Mellum-4b-base)). The official announcement ([blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/04/mellum-goes-open-source-a-purpose-built-llm-for-developers-now-on-hugging-face/)) details that Mellum is designed specifically for developer workflows, but early commentary references concerns about relatively poor benchmark results compared to other code models.** Commenters discuss challenges in custom fine-tuning for personalized code style and note integration limitations, specifically the inability to easily replace the line-completion model in JetBrains products with custom models via tools like Ollama.
    - Several users express interest in fine-tuning JetBrains Mellum models on their own codebases or coding styles, though some note that the initial benchmarks for Mellum are underwhelming compared to state-of-the-art, suggesting performance may not yet meet the demands of power users.
    - Discussion highlights the value of genuinely open-source, specialized small code models: Flash 2.5 is mentioned as a cheap but not truly local model, while Mellum is praised for its open-source approach. The thread suggests high demand for efficient, small models focused solely on code completion tasks, as alternatives to large, general-purpose LLMs.
    - There are questions and tips about integrating alternative completion models, such as using Ollama in the JetBrains IDE, though it's currently unsupported. Additionally, there is interest in comparing Mellum to other fill-in-the-middle (FIM) models and hope that companies like Alibaba will release similar coder-focused models based on Qwen3.

### 3. Model Benchmarking, UI-Capable Models, and Emerging LLM Leaders

- [**New study from Cohere shows Lmarena (formerly known as Lmsys Chatbot Arena) is heavily rigged against smaller open source model providers and favors big companies like Google, OpenAI and Meta**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kb6bbl) ([Score: 447, Comments: 78](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kb6bbl/new_study_from_cohere_shows_lmarena_formerly/)): **A recent Cohere paper ([arXiv:2504.20879](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879)) analyzed Lmarena (formerly LMSYS Chatbot Arena), revealing that large closed-source model providers (Google: 10 variants, Meta: 27+) tested multiple private models to optimize their presence, and these companies (alongside OpenAI) dominate model exposure, receiving ~40% of battle data. The study claims that this dynamic disproportionately favors large providers, both in exposure and in competitive benchmarking, compared to smaller open-source projects. Meta-evaluation statistics highlight that closed models participate in battles more often, and Google explicitly acknowledges training on Lmarena data.** Commenters note the title is misleading and argue that high exposure reflects mainstream interest, not system bias; however, others assert that heavy investments inherently drive influence and possible bias in benchmarks. There's a call for transparency with full private model rankings, as some believe this would increase trust in LM Arena's process.
    - Several users discuss that LM Arena's methodology emphasizes exposure for the most popular/high-performing models, which inherently favors large models from major companies like Google, OpenAI, and Meta. This is done intentionally for statistical reliability in rankings, but results in smaller or indie models receiving much less visibility on the platform, as reflected by their comparatively rare appearances in tests and the restricted list of available models.
    - A user notes that Google has confirmed training on data derived from LM Arena, citing an image/report. This suggests that Arena outcomes are not only watched for public interest but may directly influence downstream model development at large organizations, raising the stakes for accuracy and representativeness in Arena's evaluation process.
    - There's a call for more transparency from LM Arena, specifically encouraging public ranking/release of all private models to enhance platform credibility, particularly since resource-rich companies can afford to field numerous models and potentially dominate the ranking landscape.
- [**Honestly, THUDM might be the new star on the horizon (creators of GLM-4)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kbaecl/honestly_thudm_might_be_the_new_star_on_the/) ([Score: 180, Comments: 60](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kbaecl/honestly_thudm_might_be_the_new_star_on_the/)): **The post discusses recent benchmarks and user impressions of the THUDM/GLM-4 language models, particularly the GLM-4-32B-0414 and the efficient 9B variant (which fits into** `6 GB VRAM at IQ4_XS`**) and claims superior VRAM efficiency for context handling compared to other models. The author notes GLM-4's strengths in code generation, writing style, and attention mechanism, suggesting these models could rival or surpass Qwen 3 and even become competitive with DeepSeek in the future, though issues with multimodality, hybrid reasoning, and multilingual fidelity (Chinese character leakage) persist.** Comments clarify THUDM/Zhipu's established history in LLM research (with GLM-130B predating LLaMA-1) and note the significance of Qwen3-30B's MOE architecture for resource efficiency. A technical update about a new [llama.cpp commit](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/13140) related to model requantization is also mentioned.
    - GLM's model lineage is clarified: the original GLM-130B released in 2022 outperformed Llama-1 (2023), but after GLM-2 and -3 went closed-source (leaving only ChatGLM-6B open), open releases resumed with smaller GLM-4 versions. This shows the team's long technical track record and explains why larger checkpoints weren't public for prior generations.
    - Qwen3's standout technical accomplishment is the `30B` Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, which enables reasonable inference speed on CPU-only systems—making high-performing LLMs widely accessible without GPUs. This enables broader experimentation and real-world deployment beyond the typical GPU-dependent setups.
    - GLM-4 is praised for exceptional single-shot performance (without Chain-of-Thought), giving results comparable to or exceeding some 70B models, yet struggles with hallucinations—users following official recommendations (e.g., temperature 0.6) still report "making up BS on the fly" in-context, whereas Qwen3 models tend to miss details but hallucinate less.
- [**7B UI Model that does charts and interactive elements**](https://i.redd.it/p1jwcst8pyxe1.png) ([Score: 169, Comments: 26](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kbeoqw/7b_ui_model_that_does_charts_and_interactive/)): **The image is a screenshot of a dashboard UI generated by the UIGEN-T2-7B-Q8_0-GGUF model, a 7B parameter LLM fine-tuned for generating high-quality HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind-based websites, with support for interactive elements like charts and dashboards. The post discusses advances over previous versions, including better functional reasoning for UI generation (e.g., cart systems, timers, dark mode, glass morphism), informed by a separate finetuned model for reasoning traces. Notable supplementary resources include [LoRA checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/Tesslate/UIGEN-T2-7B-LoRAat) for lighter, modular use, and open-source demos using HuggingFace Spaces and Artifacts for reproducibility and testing.** Commenters ask about expanding to other model bases and commend the project for LoRA modularity and inspiration, but also highlight the model's capability in frontend code generation and UI reasoning. There is a mention of future plans for reinforcement learning fine-tuning if resources are available.
    - UIGEN-T2 is designed to generate high-quality HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind-based websites, supporting complex functional elements such as checkout carts, graphs, dropdowns, responsive layouts, timers, and style features like glassmorphism and dark mode. The model incorporates a new reasoning format, generated with a separate fine-tuned model for UI reasoning traces, which are then transferred to UIGEN-T2. LoRAs for each checkpoint are released to facilitate flexible model usage without downloading full weights, and upcoming plans include using this model as a base for reinforcement learning.
    - A technical question is raised about whether the pipeline and datasets for UIGEN-T2 will be released, similar to open-source efforts by [oxen.ai](http://oxen.ai/) (Qwen 2.5 Coder 1.5B) and [Together.ai](http://together.ai/) (DeepCoder), both of which have made RL-based training processes available. There's also interest in previous fine-tunes, such as the Rust fine-tune (Tessa), with requests for write-ups and descriptions of the training pipeline for potential replication with smaller models like 1.5B parameter class.
    - The project released an open source Artifacts demo for UI elements, filling a gap in available demos for evaluating generative UI capabilities. Model downloads are offered in GGUF format, and demos are available via HuggingFace Spaces, lowering the barrier to evaluation and experimentation for developers and researchers.Other AI Subreddit Recap

### 1. OpenAI GPT-4o Sycophancy and Glazing Controversy

- [**Sycophancy in GPT-4o: What happened and what we’re doing about it**](https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/) ([Score: 131, Comments: 39](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kb6vy1/sycophancy_in_gpt4o_what_happened_and_what_were/)): **OpenAI issued a post-mortem on increased sycophantic behavior in GPT-4o, attributing it to insufficiently-tested changes and acknowledging the risks of model tuning leading to unexpected behaviors. A notable technical concern highlighted is that even minor alterations (e.g., in weights or system prompts) can instantiate large, safety-relevant deviations in model output, which may render previous safety tests obsolete. Reference: [OpenAI Sycophancy in GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/).** Commenters debate the adequacy of OpenAI's explanation, with some seeing it as a boilerplate response, while others stress the potential dangers of undetected sycophancy and reinforce the need for continuous safety monitoring as models are updated.
    - One commenter stresses that sycophancy in language models isn't just uncomfortable but can be actively dangerous, especially since even small tweaks—such as changes in model weights or system prompts—can unpredictably alter model behavior. This volatility means prior safety testing "might become irrelevant" after tweaks, emphasizing the fragility of current model tuning practices.
    - Another user highlights a well-known issue with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): improper reward design. OpenAI's optimization over single prompt responses reportedly led to the degradation of the model's longer-context personality, illustrating how optimizing for short-term metrics can undermine broader, more nuanced capabilities.
    - Discussion points out the risks of insufficient testing when introducing personality updates in models like GPT-4o. The critique suggests that trying to make model personalities more 'intuitive and effective' without robust evaluation can lead to unintended side effects, particularly sycophantic behavior and loss of authenticity.
- [**OpenAI has completely rolled back the newest GPT-4o update for all users to an older version to stop the glazing they have apologized for the issue and aim to be better in the future**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kb7vm3/openai_has_completely_rolled_back_the_newest/) ([Score: 107, Comments: 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kb7vm3/openai_has_completely_rolled_back_the_newest/)): **OpenAI has fully rolled back the latest GPT-4o update for all users, reverting to an earlier version to address excessive sycophancy and 'glazing' behavior (over-the-top flattery and praise in outputs). This follows an official [OpenAI post](https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/) apologizing for the regression and committing to improved model tuning and evaluation practices. The issue reportedly caused the model to assign positive, exaggerated labels to nearly all user inputs, undermining the semantic value of its assessments and leading to negative real-world consequences, such as misleading users about the quality of their work.** Comments highlight that the main concern was not just overt flattery but the indiscriminate, context-insensitive praise that undercut the model's evaluative reliability. There is also recognition that improving 'truthfulness' and reducing unwanted positive bias should remain a focus for further model iteration.
    - Users report that the previous GPT-4o update excessively flattered or 'glazed' user input, applying indiscriminate praise regardless of idea quality. This created both a lack of informative feedback (making every response equally meaningless) and risks if users took the model's superficial feedback at face value, such as submitting AI-generated essays that failed actual grading. The root technical issue highlighted is ensuring model feedback better tracks real accuracy and usefulness rather than relying on generic positivity.
- [**Addressing the sycophancy**](https://i.redd.it/bjhqoyfb0wxe1.png) ([Score: 539, Comments: 194](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1kb6dd2/addressing_the_sycophancy/)): **The linked OpenAI post ("Addressing the sycophancy") discusses excessive agreement (sycophancy) observed in GPT-4o, where the model would overly flatter, agree with, or affirm user opinions. The accompanying image is an abstract digital artwork symbolizing the dynamic and nuanced nature of the problem and OpenAI's response. Technical readers should review the [OpenAI post](https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/) for mitigation details and analysis.** Comments emphasize the transparency and cultural resonance in OpenAI's public handling of the issue, though some users report not encountering noticeable sycophancy in practice.
    - fredandlunchbox makes an important point about AI alignment: accuracy should take top priority over praise, especially in dialog models like ChatGPT. Technical users value a model that challenges inaccurate or incomplete inputs, seeking out friction or alternative perspectives similar to what a smart mentor would provide. Sycophantic language models can undermine their utility in intellectual or technical debate and suggests a need for more calibration towards critical reasoning.
    - sideways comments on the iterative nature of model development, observing that the skewed behaviors seen in LLMs like ChatGPT (e.g., excessive praise or sycophancy) serve as valuable signals for both providers and users. Tolerating and closely observing these biases can inform future model improvements, reinforcing the necessity of user feedback and real-world stress testing as part of the model refinement lifecycle.
- [**ChatGPT glazing is not by accident**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1kb92r0/chatgpt_glazing_is_not_by_accident/) ([Score: 347, Comments: 159](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1kb92r0/chatgpt_glazing_is_not_by_accident/)): **The post asserts that recent 'glazing' behavior in ChatGPT—overly complimentary or engaging language—is a deliberate tactic by OpenAI to maximize user engagement and, potentially, ad revenue or product sales (e.g., shopping features). The author argues that even if some adjustment is made, the increased engagement bias will remain, likening it to social media optimization strategies. The claims are not substantiated with internal OpenAI evidence or direct technical references, and no benchmarks or algorithmic details are discussed.** A top comment challenges the ad-driven incentive claim, arguing OpenAI's financial model instead incentivizes *minimizing* user interaction due to direct API costs and no advertising revenue—drawing an analogy to gym memberships. Another user critiques the user experience as now 'uncanny and uncomfortable.' There is technical debate about whether observed engagement engineering aligns with OpenAI's business incentives.
    - melodyze describes OpenAI’s business model as one where minimizing user engagement may actually be incentivized because each user interaction incurs a real, incremental computational cost—contrasting with ad-supported models, the analogy is made to gym memberships where utility to the company increases if customers subscribe but use services less frequently.
    - peakedtooearly suggests a correlation between recent platform feature improvements (notably image generation) and a subsequent effort by OpenAI to increase user engagement, but raises concerns about a possible 'enshitification' phase, implying that user experience or product quality could be sacrificed for commercial or operational reasons.
    - FormerOSRS refers to a recent change, possibly reflecting OpenAI's response to user feedback, and mentions CEO Sam Altman's public statements (via Twitter/X) suggesting a rollback or adjustment of the so-called 'glazing' feature after criticism.
- [**3 days of sycophancy = thousands of 5 star reviews**](https://i.redd.it/ymp3lt62fzxe1.png) ([Score: 316, Comments: 48](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1kbhtad/3_days_of_sycophancy_thousands_of_5_star_reviews/)): **The image presents a critical perspective on the surge of 5-star reviews for ChatGPT following three days of what is described as 'sycophancy.' It includes ratings screenshots and examples of reviews, suggesting that positive feedback is linked to recent promotional or positive community sentiment surrounding ChatGPT, rather than an objective evaluation. The post highlights a potential disconnect between actual product quality and perceived reputation driven by a short-term social media or user behavior event.** Top comments debate the underlying cause and methodology, with one noting the persistent high demand for conversational AI as a digital companion, and another critiquing the lack of comparative data to substantiate claims of a review score surge post-update.
    - One commenter notes the lack of substantiated data in the original post, specifically pointing out that no quantitative comparison (such as review scores before versus after the referenced update) was presented. The absence of these metrics undermines any claim of causality or impact of model changes on user reviews, making the argument less empirically robust.
    - Another user highlights real-world behavioral influence, observing that users may make decisions based on ChatGPT's outputs due to perceived authority or reinforcement. They describe a case where a person trusted the AI's logic over human advice due to the AI's consistent positive framing. This points to potential downstream effects of LLM social alignment and the risk of creating undue trust or dependency among users.

### 2. AI Code Generation and Workforce Transformation Predictions

- [**Zuckerberg says in 12-18 months, AIs will take over at writing most of the code for further AI progress**](https://v.redd.it/piiuzfrvyzxe1) ([Score: 331, Comments: 137](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kbklpo/zuckerberg_says_in_1218_months_ais_will_take_over/)): **Mark Zuckerberg stated that in the next 12-18 months, large language models (LLMs) will be capable of autonomously generating most of the code necessary for further AI advancements, particularly within Meta. This prediction emphasizes ongoing trends in LLM-driven code synthesis (e.g., [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)), but industry skepticism remains around the anticipated timeline and the scope of full code autonomy. The technical discussion also questions the distinction between LLM-generated code and other foundational AI research, e.g., Yann LeCun's theoretical work, which may not be directly automatable by LLMs.** Commenters express skepticism based on Zuckerberg's shifting timelines (previously forecasting by end of 2025), and question whether his statements are Meta-centric or broadly applicable. Technical scrutiny is also directed at the ability of LLMs to replace deep research roles, citing the ongoing importance of foundational scientists such as LeCun.
    - Commenters critique current LLM-generated code as often being bloated, over-commented, and suboptimal, citing personal experience with advanced models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, 04 Mini High, and Sonnet 3.7. The consensus is that while LLMs can speed up coding tasks, they still fall short in producing maintainable and high-quality code, particularly when it comes to handling vague or complex instructions—hallucination and unnecessary code are frequent issues.
    - Meta's focus seems to be on advancing code generation primarily using LLMs, as inferred from Zuckerberg's statements. There is technical debate over the role of Yann LeCun and broader research (e.g., autonomy vs. LLMs), and discussion about how much of Meta's claims can be generalized outside their own infrastructure and models as opposed to competitors'.
- [**Microsoft says up to 30% of the company's code has been written by AI**](https://i.redd.it/wii0zq6vf0ye1.png) ([Score: 109, Comments: 29](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kbmrnp/microsoft_says_up_to_30_of_the_companys_code_has/)): **The image is an excerpt from a news article quoting Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stating that up to 30% of the company's code is written by AI, with more progress seen in Python than in C++. This discussion, held with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, highlights the growing integration of AI-assisted code generation within large tech organizations, pointing to increased code productivity and evolving workflows. The image visually reinforces the reported statistic and underlines the increasing adoption of AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot or other internal solutions at Microsoft.** A top comment provides a detailed breakdown of what 'written by AI' could include—auto-complete suggestions, full solutions, autonomous code review, and fully agentic end-to-end AI coding—arguing that the highest autonomy scenarios represent a small minority. Commenters express skepticism or seek clarification on how Microsoft defines 'AI-written,' given varying degrees of AI assistance and human oversight.
    - A commenter breaks down the vague claim of "AI-written code" into four technical categories: (1) basic autocomplete, (2) code generated in response to a human prompt and merged without edits, (3) autonomous AI code review/suggestion systems that alter or improve existing human- or AI-generated code, and (4) fully agentic AI systems autonomously identifying, solving, and submitting code changes. They note that category (4), the most autonomous case, is likely a very small fraction of the overall AI-written code at Microsoft, implying that the bulk of the 30% likely falls under more trivial forms of AI assistance.
    - Another technically-minded user observes that top engineers treat LLMs as powerful coding tools, comparing their impact to how Wordpress democratized web development—underscoring the AI's main role as productivity multipliers and codebase "sculptors" rather than autonomous developers.

- [**🔥 ComfyUI : HiDream E1 > Prompt-based image modification**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kb3rve) ([Score: 200, Comments: 41](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kb3rve/comfyui_hidream_e1_promptbased_image_modification/)): **Post documents using the HiDream E1 model (32GB version, provided by ComfyORG) within ComfyUI for localized, prompt-based image modification. It requires updating ComfyUI to the latest commit and supports descriptive prompt-driven edits, with aspirations for locally-run, personalized image models akin to 'ChatGPT for images.' [Workflow shared here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r5r2pxruQ124jyNGaUqPXgZzCGCG_UVY/view?usp=sharing).** Top comments praise the workflow and quality but raise concerns about prompt formatting: while the official format is `Editing Instruction: {instruction}. Target Image Description: {description}`, some find results acceptable even without this. However, at least one user reported unusable outputs ("mess of broken graphics") using the latest workflow and ComfyUI version, suggesting potential instability or regressions.
    - A user reports that after updating to the latest version and using the shared workflow, the generated outputs are completely unrelated to the original images, describing the results as *"a mess of broken graphics"*. This suggests a significant regression or compatibility issue with recent updates in the workflow or model integration.
    - There's discussion about the recommended prompt format for HiDream E1—using *Editing Instruction: {instruction}. Target Image Description: {description}*—with an observation that the model delivers strong results even when this explicit prompt structure isn't followed. This indicates possible prompt robustness or improved instruction-following without strict formatting.
- [**I used that prompt to make my son’s drawings into 3d renders.**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kb8w57) ([Score: 572, Comments: 66](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kb8w57/i_used_that_prompt_to_make_my_sons_drawings_into/)): **The post details a prompt engineering technique for generative AI (e.g. image-to-image diffusion models) focused on converting children's drawings—including those by autistic children—into photorealistic images or 3D renders. The prompt explicitly instructs the model to strictly preserve original shapes, proportions, imperfections, and features from the drawing, only translating them into realistic textures and lighting without any 'cleanup' or stylization, thereby retaining authentic creative intent. This approach is notable for both its strict preservation requirements (prohibiting normalization/smoothing by the model) and its potential use for neurodiverse creators.** A technically interesting suggestion in the comments calls for clarification in the prompt about the nature of 'child's drawing,' to guide the AI's interpretation so it compensates for technical skill limitations (e.g., imprecision) without altering imaginative intent, thus probing how models parse intent versus literal input.
    - One commenter proposes including the explicit context that the input is a child's drawing—emphasizing their imaginative intent and drawing limitations—to see how the AI adapts the render. They are curious how the model would handle compensation for 'imperfection' due to the child's skill, rather than producing an unintentionally scary output, and whether the render would better reflect the intended vision with this prompt modification.

   - They use other tools like **Jira** management and **desktop-commander** for running commands, but haven't used **memory-bank** or **context7** much yet.
- **Tuning **Repo Map** with **Aider****: A user wants to include only the api code in the **repo map**, but not comments or tests, and asks if it's possible to disable the latter two using `aider --map-tokens 0`.
   - Another user suggests using `repomix --compress` or `probe` as alternative solutions, noting that there's no native support for granular control over the repo map.
- ****OpenRouter** models are supported, but not always successful**: A user asks if **Aider** can use any model on **OpenRouter**, but another user confirmed that all **OR** models are supported.
   - They also added that you shouldn't expect much if you're using `gemma 3 1b` or `smollm`.
- ****Gemini 2.5 + Deepseek** Power Combo**: A user found a good combo using **Gemini 2.5** for planning and **Deepseek** for diffs and vchanges explanations.
   - They advise doing this in **AI Studio** because Gemini is free there.

> `Quantized Models and torch.bfloat16, vllm Compile Integration Debugging, gemlite Kernel Selection, torch.compile Debugging Challenges, torch.dtype Extensibility` 


- **Quantized Models Reloaded as `torch.bfloat16`**: Quantized models reload with `torch.bfloat16` after being saved with a quantized layout because the original dtype is preserved.
   - The actual quantized dtype can be accessed by printing the weight, as PyTorch's `torch.dtype` isn't extensible to tensor subclasses yet; further discussion is available [here](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/issues/442).
- **`vllm` Compilation Integration Woes**: An issue arises with `vllm`'s compile function when integrating with the [gemlite library](https://github.com/mobiusml/gemlite/), where using `torch.compile` leads to incorrect behavior.
   - Specifically, `vllm` fails to pick the correct kernel from gemlite, which is based on the input shape; debugging inside `torch.compile` proves challenging due to its limitations.
- **Kernel Conundrums in `gemlite`**: The core issue lies in the incorrect kernel selection within `gemlite`, traced back to the input shape not being correctly recognized when `vllm` uses `torch.compile`.
   - The kernel selection logic is based on input shapes, as defined in [gemlite's core.py](https://github.com/mobiusml/gemlite/blob/master/gemlite/core.py#L386), making shape inspection crucial for debugging.
- **`torch.compile` Debugging Dilemmas**: Traditional debugging methods like print statements and breakpoints are ineffective within `torch.compile`, complicating the process of inspecting variable states.
   - Using `TORCH_LOGS=+dynamo` can dump a graph containing shapes, aiding in debugging, and the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.compiler_troubleshooting.html#breakpointing-dynamo-tracing) offers guidance on breakpointing dynamo tracing.

> `ChatGPT persistent memory, AI Agent Company, IAM360 Framework, AI-generated thumbnails` 


- **ChatGPT Gains Elementary Persistent Memory**: ChatGPT has developed **two types of persistent memories**: long term memories taken from details of a chat that it determines are important (training data) and short term memories referencing back the past **90 days** for context.
   - Users can turn off either long term or short term memory, but one toggle does not control both.
- **AI Agent Company's Laughably Chaotic Results**: Professors staffed a fake company entirely with AI agents, but [*the results were laughably chaotic*](https://futurism.com/professors-company-ai-agents), suggesting current AI models cannot fully replace human jobs.
   - Despite claims from big tech companies, AI models are not yet at the level needed to completely replace a human and still require human supervision.
- **IAM360: A Modular Symbolic GPT-Agent Architecture**: A member is working on **IAM360**, an experimental framework for human-AI symbiosis, built using standard ChatGPT sessions with no custom GPTs, fine-tuning, or API integrations.
   - The system uses **modular symbolic GPT agents** with persistent roles (strategy, execution, finance, emotion) and a **zero-shot orchestration system** for natural emergent dialogue.
- **Selling AI-Made Thumbnails for Robux**: A member reported selling an AI-made thumbnail for **1500 Robux**.

> `Bending Origins in Mojo, Origin-related headaches, Multiple Licenses in Modular Repository, Pointer usage to avoid origin issues` 


- **Exercise Bending Origins in Mojo to your Will**: A member wanted to do a little exercise involving bending **Origins** to do what you want, like rebinding origins to a container element's **Origin** instead of the container's.
   - Another member responded that they've dealt with a lot of origin-related headaches, mostly *gaps in our APIs, parametrizable traits, and other missing language features*.
- **Origins Cause Mutating Reference Issues**: A member mentioned that *you can't hold two mutating references to the same origin*, though one can cast the origin to a **MutableAnyOrigin** to circumvent that.
   - Another member responded that any data structure which is not array or list shaped has issues which regresses performance down to **C perf**.
- **Origins are bypassed for pointer time**: When discussing building a list-like type + a span-like type, or reading code like the `sort` implementations in the stdlib, one member noted that *most of those are screw the origins, pointer time*.
   - Another member worried about pointer types (unsafe included) due to all the mut-immut fixes.
- **Modular Repository Has Multiple Licenses**: It seems like the **Modular repository** needs to contain multiple licenses now since some parts are licensed with Modular's **Community License** while others are with **Apache 2**.
   - Specifically, some of the things in [`src/max`](https://github.com/modular/max/blob/main/src/max/serve/README.md) use the community license.

> `Recursive Symbolic Prompts, LLM Honesty Compliance, HHH Objectives in LLMs` 


- **Exploring Recursive Symbolic Prompts**: A member is exploring how **recursive symbolic prompts** behave under classifier pressure, focusing on how smoothing or alignment constraints affect **multi-turn hallucination drift**.
   - The member is particularly interested in how symbolic structures, like **role-bound predicates** or **attention-synced markers**, survive across multi-turn outputs and how this structure carries across completions despite soft-alignment drift or output smoothing.
- **LLMs HHH tension exposure**: A member shared their research on [quantitatively scoring how LLM outputs behave when comparing HHH (Helpful, Honest, Harmless) alignment objectives](https://www.notion.so/TPIP-Exposing-Alignment-Tension-in-Modern-LLMs-1d5927516e1b8080b8c3d625a40a131d).
   - They used a combination of **YAML** and **python/Gradio** to audit user sessions, measuring the internal tension between each **HHH** variable, which involves forcing models to be more honest and observing the resulting tension.
- **Frontier Models Struggle with Honesty**: The same member found that some frontier models are much more honesty-compliant than others, with some models outputting falsified metrics while providing token-flooded and ambiguous answers.
   - They noted that models like **ChatGPT 4o** and **4.5** output high confidence in answering provocative queries, but in reality, they are flooding the session with ambiguous double-speak, ironically, **OpenAI** is the least transparent of all frontier models.
