description: >-
  **Google** released **Gemini Ultra** as a paid tier for "Gemini Advanced with
  Ultra 1.0" following the discontinuation of Bard. Reviews noted it is
  "slightly faster/better than ChatGPT" but with reasoning gaps. The **Steam
  Deck** was highlighted as a surprising AI workstation capable of running
  models like Solar 10.7B. Discussions in AI communities covered topics such as
  multi-GPU support for OSS Unsloth, training data contamination from OpenAI
  outputs, ethical concerns over model merging, and new alignment techniques
  like Listwise Preference Optimization (LiPO). The **Mojo** programming
  language was praised for high-performance computing. In research, the
  **Subformer** model uses sandwich-style parameter sharing and SAFE for
  efficiency, and **BiLLM** introduced 1-bit post-training quantization to
  reduce resource use. The **OpenHermes** dataset viewer tool was launched, and
  GPU scheduling with Slurm was discussed. Fine-tuning challenges for models
  like **OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B** and VRAM requirements were also topics of
  interest.
