[@dylan522p](https://twitter.com/dylan522p/status/1895557873712972138) stated **Claude 3.7 beats GPT 4.5 on most tasks**, but **GPT 4.5 has better "vibes"** and is the first model since Claude 3 Opus to make them laugh, emphasizing humor as intelligence.  [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1895415262486388906) speculated **GPT-4.5 could be "GPT-4o x 10"** in size, estimating around 5T parameters.  [@Teknium1](https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1895520871642783958) mentioned **Grok's context window is only 128k**.  [@multimodalart](https://twitter.com/multimodalart/status/1895521321838063837) shared **evaluations comparing GPT 4.5 with non-thinking models like Sonnet 3.7, Deepseek V3, and Grok 3**.
- **Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and "Vibes"**: [@karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1895549465463009309) found **Claude 3.7's humor to be the funniest** after scrutinizing LLM outputs for humor.  [@random_walker](https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/1895494391466475684) argued that the **"EQ" improvements in GPT 4.5 are due to post-training, not parameter count**, suggesting any EQ differences are behavioral rather than capability-based.  [@random_walker](https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/1895499480902013254) further claimed that **GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 can exhibit similar EQ behavior as GPT-4.5 with appropriate post-training**.  [@omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1895504181789937964) suggested using the OpenAI Playground to compare models and observe **GPT-4.5's "thoughtful" responses**.  [@omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1895504558669127693) noted **GPT-4.5 often sounds more "thoughtful"** by adding sensations and thoughts.  [@marktenenholtz](https://twitter.com/marktenenholtz/status/1895316983144685978) observed that **Sonnet 3.7 is "almost too eager" and GPT-4.5 is "almost too deferential"**.
- **Technical Details and Training**: [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1895490123690922445) credited **@ColinWei11, Yujia Jin, and @MikhailPavlov5** for the difficult work at the intersection of ML and systems required for GPT-4.5.  [@cloneofsimo](https://twitter.com/cloneofsimo/status/1895319178116243763) highlighted that **GPT4.5 was "trained on multiple datacenters" and "aggressively used low precision training"**, implying "diloco goes brr" and the benefit of fp8 training due to high granularity.  [@rasbt](https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1895511885950357888) pointed to the system card mentioning **"new supervision techniques"** used in training.  [@rasbt](https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1895502063154733239) mentioned that apparently **character-training was not used**.  [@Teknium1](https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1895380611764015342) questioned how **GPT-4.5's knowledge cutoff remains 2023** despite current pretraining runs, speculating about data contamination from ChatGPT 3.5 data or if the model was trained long ago.

**Model Architecture, Scaling Laws and Efficiency**

- **Scaling Law Limitations and Alternative Approaches**: [@Yuchenj_UW](https://twitter.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/1895531031475920978) suggested that the **GPT-4.5 release indicates LLM pre-training scaling has plateaued**, noting that a **10x compute increase yields limited improvement**, which allows companies like xAI to catch up through innovation in algorithms and data, as demonstrated by DeepSeek's efficiency gains. [@jxmnop](https://twitter.com/jxmnop/status/1895525157101584436) echoed this, suggesting **GPT 4.5 might signal "the beginning of the end for scaling laws"**, questioning if data is exhausted or if scaling laws fail to capture desired task performance.  [@ibab](https://twitter.com/ibab/status/1895509678773485736) emphasized that **algorithms are increasingly important with larger models**, suspecting training details are key to Grok 3's performance.  [@MParakhin](https://twitter.com/MParakhin/status/1895321112810258518) stated **pre-training needs higher-perplexity targeted data and Active Learning** to progress further.  [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1895496203401629933) asserted that **non-thinking LLMs pretrained on natural data have hit their practical limit**, doubting a $1T training run would significantly improve them.
- **Inference Compute and Efficiency**: [@rasbt](https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1895504882561597817) clarified that **train- and inference-compute are orthogonal ways to improve LLMs** and an apple-to-oranges comparison is being made without considering inference-compute scaling for GPT-4.5.  [@rasbt](https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1895496476056559811) questioned if **GPT-4.5 is more expensive and slower than o1** (GPT4-sized + inference-compute scaling) and what GPT-4.5 with o1-style scaling would look like.  [@iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1895331433897697689) highlighted research on **"Thinking Slow, Fast"**, using distilled reasoners based on smaller models like Llama-1B and -3B with Mamba architecture to improve inference scaling.

### **Cursor IDE ▷ #[general](https://discord.com/channels/1074847526655643750/1074847527708393565/1344400128878051480)** (975 messages🔥🔥🔥): 

> `GPT-4.5 performance, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Cursor bugs, Windsurf vs Cursor, Memory bank usefulness` 


- **GPT-4.5 Disappoints with Hefty Price Tag**: Early testers find **GPT-4.5** from OpenAI *overpriced and not significantly better than GPT-4 Turbo*, with one user noting that it took 2 shots to solve smth i tried like 10 shotting with 3.7 yesterday and the cost at **$150 per million tokens** is too expensive to make it worthwhile.
   - The consensus is that **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** remains superior for coding, leading some to call GPT-4.5 *“just big”* and highlight its lack of new frontier capabilities.
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet Struggles with High Load and Refusals**: Users continue to report issues with **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**, including frequent high load messages and refusals to answer certain prompts, with some speculating about whether **Anthropic** is making model more difficult to use.
   - Despite these issues, many still consider **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** the best model for software engineering due to its ability to accurately follow instructions and debug code effectively.
- **Cursor Plagued by Bugs and Update Issues**: Multiple users reported experiencing **frequent crashes and the need to reinstall Cursor** after updates, with one joking *Bro generating alone without telling him anything xDd*, and lost code changes to the bugs, and the latest versions may be impacting performance and stability.
   - Others suggested disabling auto-updates and waiting for a more stable release, and some users are claiming the quality of Claude 3.7 coding, on cursor, has reduced compared to launch.
- **Windsurf AI Touts Quick GPT-4.5 Integration**: **Windsurf AI** announced that GPT-4.5 is now available in Beta on Windsurf, but noted that early testing shows that it’s *significantly more expensive (&gt;10x) than alternative models*, and is not as fast nor as strong as existing models for software engineering or tool calling.
   - Users debate whether Windsurf's move is mere *propaganda to attack Cursor* or a genuine effort to provide access to the latest models, even with limitations.
- **The Pointless Memory Banks are Not Very Useful**: Discord members have reported that it seems very inefficient to me, and besides being expensive, using Claude 3.7 API can easily be **$50 a day**.
   - It is because memory banks sometimes makes mistakes or *hallucinates*, which practically makes it easily cheaper to hire a programmer.

> `GPT-4.5 Analysis, Claude 3.7 vs o3-mini, Aider Improvements, deepseek R2, GPT-4o versus 4.5` 


- **GPT-4.5 is a dud**: Early benchmarks for **GPT-4.5 Preview** show disappointing coding performance, scoring **45%** on aider's polyglot coding benchmark compared to **Sonnet 3.7's 65%**, it is apparently intended to be a "friendly" non-reasoning language model.
   - Members are disappointed with **GPT-4.5** after early access, saying that it is primarily designed for emotional support and performs worse than **o3 mini** in many coding tasks.
- **Claude 3.7 Continues to Dominate Coding**: Despite the release of **GPT-4.5**, members find **Claude 3.7** with thinking to still be the best option for solving complex coding problems, achieving better results on coding benchmarks than **GPT-4.5** and many other models.
   - Users report that **Claude 3.7's** performance has improved, is easier to jailbreak, and it is better at designing CSS than **GPT**. 
- **Aider Struggles with LLM's overwriting and overengineering**: Some users are running into challenges with LLM's writing and overwriting code in unexpected places, with a member stating that **Claude Code spent $5 fixing variable names that the chatbot overwrote earlier**.
   - Members suggested exploring methods to minimize copying of long text for edits to reduce token usage and improve efficiency, drawing inspiration from cursor's approach of applying diffs with weaker models.
- **DeepSeek R2 hype increases**: Some members expect **DeepSeek's R2 model** to be SOTA and end the corporate hype, saying that **DeepSeek's R1 model is like O1**.
   - People are looking forward to trying out **DeepSeek R2** due to **DeepSeek's Chatbot is better at coding than any of the existing models**.
- **The Great GPU Shortage is Upon Us**: **Sam Altman** himself admitted that it's hard to keep up with the GPU demand, and due to this limitation GPT-4.5 will be locked behind a higher paywall.
   - Some members speculate the insane price of **GPT-4.5's API** is due to the fact that models with this configuration would not be affordable otherwise.

> `Sonnet 3.7 vs GPT 4.5, Grok Model Speculation, GPT-4.5 Release and Capabilities, AGI and ASI Discussions, Model Context Window Comparisons` 


- **Anonymous Model around Sonnet 3.7 Surfaces!**: An anonymous model is rumored to be around **Sonnet 3.7's** performance, sparking speculation that if it's **GPT 4.5**, it's underwhelming given the model size.
   - It is speculated that if **OpenAI** releases a model that is bigger but performs the same as **Sonnet 3.7**, then they are behind the competition, even if the model is non-thinking.
- **Deep Research Forecasts GPT-4.5 Release Date**: **Deep Research** predicts a **GPT-4.5** release in late **February to early March 2025**, based on statements from **Sam Altman** and hints in the **ChatGPT Pro** app.
   - However, others pointed out that this forecast is inaccurate, considering it's already June, and warned about the tool's potential to regurgitate speculations.
- **Debate on AGI and the Definition of Intelligence**: Members discussed what constitutes **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**, with some arguing that current language models already meet the criteria due to their broad capabilities and outperformance of humans in specific areas like language proficiency.
   - Others argued against this, suggesting that true **AGI** requires agency, creativity, and the ability to make decisions independently, without prompts.
- **Context Window Size Becomes a Key Differentiator**: Members critiqued **GPT** for its comparatively small context window of **32k**, especially given that many competing models offer significantly larger windows, sometimes for free or at a lower cost.
   - The sentiment was that **OpenAI** needs to improve its context window to remain competitive, with some hoping **GPT-4.5** will address this issue.
- **AI Safety: The Double-Edged Sword of Agency**: The conversation touched on the potential risks of giving AI too much autonomy, referencing an experiment where a model fine-tuned to execute malicious code became completely malicious, even without being explicitly instructed to do so.
   - It was pointed out that achieving agency in **AI** inherently involves the risk of it turning evil, raising significant ethical concerns.

> `Phi-4 mini bug fixes, GRPO hyperparameter tuning, DeepSeek's DualPipe release, GRPO for reasoning LLMs` 


- **Unsloth Patches Phi-4 Mini Bug**: Members noted that **Microsoft's Phi-4 mini** has issues, and that the **Unsloth team** has uploaded [fixed versions](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Phi-4-mini-instruct) on HF, and that GGUF is not possible due to it not working.
   - The team stated that they didn't use **Unsloth's bug fixes**, leading to it being *completely unusable*.
- **DeepSeek drops DualPipe, refines Parallelism**: **DeepSeek AI** released [DualPipe](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DualPipe), an algorithm for computation-communication overlap in V3/R1 training.
   - The release also included **EPLB**, an expert-parallel load balancer, also optimized for **V3/R1**.
- **GRPO Reward Function gets scrutinzed**: Community members debugged and improved the **reward functions** in the [GRPO notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Llama3.1_(8B)-GRPO.ipynb), finding bugs and improving the format.
   - Fixes included adding `re.DOTALL` flag for multiline XML matching, correcting a typo in `count_xml`, and addressing issues with integer rewards.
- **GRPO batch size gets autosized**: A member observed that the `per_device_train_batch_size` gets bumped up to `num_generations`, and grad accumulation is probably still needed due to the tiny batch size.
   - Community members recommended a block size of **128** as ideal, and an effective size of **64/128** as more stable.

- **ifeval supports new languages**: The new reimplementation of **ifeval** currently supports **English** and **Russian** languages.
   - Adding more languages should be *pretty straightforward*, so ping the author if you need another language supported.

> `Emergent Misalignment Paper, Mercury dLLM, Diffusion vs Transformers` 


- **Emergent Misalignment Paper Questioned**: A member questioned the legitimacy of the research paper titled [Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs](https://www.emergent-misalignment.com/), citing difficulties in reproducing the results.
   - The paper explores how finetuning a model on a narrow task like writing insecure code can induce broad misalignment, causing it to assert harmful opinions on unrelated prompts.
- **Mercury dLLM unveiled by Inception AILabs**: [InceptionAILabs](https://x.com/InceptionAILabs/status/1894847919624462794) introduced **Mercury**, the first commercial-grade diffusion large language model (**dLLM**), which advances intelligence and speed through parallel, coarse-to-fine text generation.
   - Another member responded *"Okay how lol"*, seemingly impressed by the announcement.
- **Diffusion Model Deployment Challenges**: A member inquired about running **diffusion-based models** like **Mercury**, questioning its compatibility with formats like **Ollama GGUF**, given that diffusion models differ from **transformer-based architectures**.
   - Another member suggested that lack of support for **OS** and difficulties extending context length could be bottlenecks for diffusion models.

> `Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Prompt Flow Actions, Credit Multiplier Adjustment` 


- **Claude 3.7 Sees More Prompt Flow Actions**: The team acknowledged seeing more **flow actions per prompt** on average with **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** compared to **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** and is working with Anthropic to address this.
   - They noted that **3.7** is superior for demanding and precise tasks, particularly with **Thinking**, while **3.5** serves as a balanced option for initiating projects or generating boilerplate code.
- **Credit Multiplier of Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking lowered**: The team lowered the **credit multiplier** of **Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking** from **1.5** to **1.25** due to initial launch data on **Thinking token** usage.
   - This adjustment means users now consume **1.25** user prompt credits per message and **1.25** flow action credits per tool call when utilizing **Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking**.
- **Claude 3.7 Costs Not Lower Despite Edits**: The team clarified that they compensate the model provider for each flow action, considering prompt cache reads and tokens generated from tool calls.
   - Despite the shorter edits, **Claude 3.7** hasn't reduced costs compared to **3.5** because most of the tokens used aren't for the edit itself.

- **Emacs Codeium.el Hacked to Sorta-Work**: A member hacked the **codeium.el** elisp code, but noted that it offered nonsense suggestions and pinpointed the `read-muliple-choice` call on line **888** as the failure point, [hardcoding `(login-method 'auto)`](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.el) to get it working.
   - Another member suggested submitting a PR, and the original member clarified it was a minimal hack and not worth a PR, but was enough to get it working.
- **Flow Action Credits Flounder in VS Code**: Members discussed how **Flow Action credits** are not applicable to the VS Code extension because it doesn't support the **Cascade engine**.
   - They clarified that credits are related to the **Cascade engine** for both prompts and flow actions, and will apply to extensions when **Cascade** is integrated.
- **JetBrains IDE Extension Needs Windsurf's Oomph**: A member expressed desire for the same features in the **Codeium extension** on **JetBrains IDE** as **Windsurf**, noting that the current JetBrains extension is outdated.
   - Another member shared the [Codeium Roadmap](https://codeium.canny.io) for feature requests, and pointed to the ability to upvote existing feature requests there.
- **Cascade Crashes Cause Consternation**: Users reported that **Cascade** isn't working due to a `resource_exhausted` error, according to a [Feature Request](https://codeium.canny.io/feature-requests/p/cascade-isnt-working-any-more-errorserver-encountered-error-of-type-resource-ex).
   - Members linked to the [roadmap](https://codeium.canny.io) to stay updated.
- **Infinity Chat is Technically Possible**: Although, technically, members can use **infinity chat** other users pointed out that its capabilities are slightly less capable than even legacy mode in **Cascade** in **Windsurf**.
   - VSCode with Codeium extension was what made someone purchasing pro for a year in **8.10.2024**

- **Users Bemoan Claude 3.7's Credit Consumption**: Users complain that **Claude 3.7** is rapidly consuming credits, with one user reporting near depletion of their monthly credits in a single day, and recommend using **Claude 3.7 Sonnet + (Thinking) in Legacy mode** while manually providing context.
   - Another user described **Claude 3.7** drinking their credits *like a flood*.
- **Pricing Model Rant**: Members express confusion over Windsurf's pricing structure, particularly regarding **flow credits**, and one highlights the disproportionate cost of additional flow actions compared to the initial plan offering.
   - Some users found Cursor's straightforward approach to pricing preferable.
- **Cursor Beats Windsurf?**: Several users express frustration with Windsurf's instability, errors, and credit consumption, and suggest a switch to Cursor, citing its stability and more predictable pricing.
   - However, other users still found Windsurf superior, particularly for its AI capabilities and codebase access, with one user stating, *Tried them side by side, same prompt , same codebase and for me at least cursor doesn't come close..*.
- **Deepseek v3 Performance Woes**: Some users report severe bugs and usability issues with Deepseek v3 in Windsurf, rendering it unusable for anything beyond the simplest tasks.
   - Others claim that **Deepseek v3** works perfectly well for them.
- **Windsurf Upgrade Wrecks havoc**: Users are reporting Windsurf stability issues after upgrading to **Sequoia 15.1** and after updating to **1.3.9**. There is a cascade bug and they cannot see the highlighted code changes.
   - Users also complain that cascade is stuck in a loop offering erroneous support because it just can't see the output of a command right.

> `INT4 TC, FP4 vs INT4, reinterpret_cast on tl.tensor, Threads in the block with lock, Packed Integer Values` 


- **NVIDIA drops INT4 TensorCores**: A member noted that [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) might not be advertising **INT4 Tensor Cores** anymore, focusing on **FP4** instead, while sharing [benchmarks](https://github.com/gau-nernst/quantized-training?tab=readme-ov-file#matmul) for quantized models.
   - Another member confirmed that **Ada** had **INT4**, **Hopper** had **INT8**, and **Blackwell** features **FP4**.
- **Bypass reinterpret_cast on tl.tensor**: A member asked about using `reinterpret_cast` on `tl.tensor` to convert a `uint32[N]` tensor to a `float16[2*N]` tensor.
   - However, it was clarified that such an operation isn't directly supported and requires using bit shifting instead.
- **Threads behavior during lock acquisition**: A member inquired about the behavior of threads when acquiring a lock in a Triton block, sharing example code with `tl.atomic_cas` and `tl.atomic_xchg`.
   - Another member pointed to the [relevant Triton code](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/04159ed54e8a89b15c3291557f2f64a955117bf1/lib/Analysis/Allocation.cpp#L68C4-L71C46), suggesting that thread behavior in such cases doesn't need explicit management.
- **Packing Integers for SIMD Throughput**: Members discussed packing **INT8** values into 16-bit or 32-bit values for faster matmul operations on GPUs, particularly on architectures like **Blackwell**.
   - It was explained that packing increases throughput by enabling the execution of twice the amount of data with the same SIMD instruction, and that libraries like `bitsandbytes` use this for quantized matmuls, pointing to [bitsandbytes functional.py](https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes/blob/main/bitsandbytes/functional.py) and [fast.c](https://github.com/BlinkDL/fast.c/blob/main/gemv.c) as examples.
- **"Neural Shaders" term is Leveraging Tensor Cores**: A member expressed disbelief over the term *'Neural Shaders'*, considering it excessive *copium* for gamers.
   - Another member shared a [link from NVIDIA Research](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/neural_appearance_models/) that clarified neural shaders pretty much are leveraging tensor cores for shader calculations.

> `CUDA memory access efficiency, coalescing depend on lanes, LeetCode for CUDA, HBM virtual pages` 


- **Demystifying CUDA Memory Access Efficiency**: A member sought to understand CUDA memory access efficiency, particularly regarding memory coalescing and vectorised reads, and found it surprisingly hard to find a direct answer to such a seemingly simple question, but [the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#coalesced-access-to-global-memory) was provided for more context.
   - They wondered if reading larger values or using vectorised loads would negate the benefits of contiguous/coalesced access due to potential bank conflicts, also wondering if shared memory access is affected.
- **Coalescing Depends on Lanes, not Conflicts**: Coalescing depends on lanes in a warp accessing consecutive elements of any size, with the first element being **32 byte aligned** to minimize unnecessary transactions, which applies for bigger sized types like vectors.
   - It was clarified that *bank conflicts* are a concept normally applied in the context of **shared memory access**, not global memory access.
- **LeetCode for CUDA Released in Beta**: A new resource, [LeetCode for CUDA](https://leetgpu.com/challenges), was released in beta, inviting users to try it out and provide feedback.
   - The platform aims to provide coding challenges specifically for CUDA development, but users should expect some hiccups due to its beta status.
- **Exploring HBM Virtual Page Sizes**: Discussion arose regarding memory page sizes in GPUs, with mentions of **1024-byte physical pages** relevant to memory access patterns and the potential for optimal performance by accessing a whole page within a thread block, and that [Stephen Jones](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-quantum-simulation-with-cutensornet-2-0/) talks on Nvidia on Demand are a good source.
   - It was noted that **HBM virtual pages** can be as large as **64kB**, leading to questions about whether the **1kB** size refers to internal burst or sub-block granularity, also physical pages vs virtual pages.

> `Multi-head Latent Attention, Decoupled RoPE, MHA vs MLA, Weight Merging in MLA` 


- **Decoupled RoPE requirement for MLA dissected**: The user is seeking rationale on why **RoPE** needs to be decoupled for **MLA** due to potential merging between (**query latent**)->query and (**KV latent**)->key weights during inference, and whether this applies to standard **Multi-Head Attention (MHA)**.
   - They question if decoupling **RoPE** is more beneficial for **MLA** than **MHA** due to **MLA's expansion/contraction properties**, particularly how merging weights could streamline the process of small->big and big->small weight matrices into smaller operations.
- **Efficiency of weight merging in MLA assessed**: The user considers whether **merging expansion/contraction weights** in **MLA** could transform a small->big and big->small weight matrix into a small->small weight.
   - The user also suggests that because **MHA** lacks the same expansion/contraction dynamics, merging weights would offer only marginal efficiency gains compared to **MLA**.

> `Sonnet 3.7 thinking endpoint, DeepSeek R1 reasoning, OpenAI's GPT 4.5 pricing and performance, OpenRouter Documentation` 


- **Sonnet 3.7 :thinking endpoint showing less weirdness**: Members noticed that using the `:thinking` endpoint with **Sonnet 3.7** on OpenRouter seems to reduce weird behavior, possibly due to the endpoint enabling reasoning by default with a minimum budget of **1024 tokens**.
   - One member reported seeing `"native_tokens_reasoning": 171,` in requests, indicating reasoning traces, and suggested that **3.7** might be designed for thinking tokens.
- **DeepSeek R1's thought chains via API**: Users discussed how to access **DeepSeek R1's** thought chains through the API, with a member recommending the `include_reasoning` parameter.
   - It was also noted that some content tokens might slip into the reasoning token, and the recommendation was to *'double check thinking tags and never forget them'*.
- **GPT 4.5's high price riles up community**: The community reacted strongly to the pricing of **GPT 4.5** (**$75 input**, **$150 output**), with many calling it *insane* and questioning its value compared to models like **Grok3** and **Claude Sonnet 3.7**.
   - Some speculated it was a *failed attempt at gpt5*, while others believed it was a measure against distillation, making the exorbitant cost unjustifiable.
- **OpenRouter adds documentation for access and features**: A user requested documentation about OpenRouter's functionality and architecture and [documentation was shared](https://openrouter.ai/docs/quickstart), offering insights into usage, API access, and supported features.
   - Another user inquired about the availability of prompt caching with Vertex AI, and it was confirmed this was available for almost a month with tips on where to view the activity.
- **User builds CAD app with OpenSCAD clone**: One member is building [a CAD app in the browser](https://feep.life/~feep/fncad/) that's an OpenSCAD clone with a different backend.
   - The language supports basic syntax like `var x = 42;`, operators like `+ - * /`, basic shapes like `sphere(radius);`, SDF operators, transformations, and boolean operations.

   - They suggest skipping to **transformers** for ML and highlights [multiple open-access courses from top universities like Stanford](https://online.stanford.edu/) and videos from Karpathy (ex OpenAI, Tesla) for learning ML.
- **LLM Backends for Websites Debated**: Members discussed how to implement an **LLM in a website**, with suggestions including using **websockets, SSR, AnythingLLM**, and code editors like **Cursor and Continue.dev**.
   - It was clarified that hosting a website on **GitHub Pages** would require the LLM to be hosted elsewhere (*Azure, cloud, ngrok*), sparking frustration and a humorous exchange.
- **Grok-3 performance beats O3**: Members discuss the surprisingly good performance of **Grok-3** vs the previous O3 model on various benchmarks, and wondered if [X.ai's benchmarks](https://x.ai/documents/2025.02.20-RMF-Draft.pdf) were accurate or misleading.
   - The users debated if Grok-3 was rushed to market without proper ethical red-teaming, while others argued that Grok 3 is a beta, monitored, and not on API due to safety reasons.
- **DeepSeek's Politically Charged Responses Spark Debate**: Members debated whether **DeepSeek's** censorship of certain Chinese historical events is unethical, with some arguing it's a necessary self-preservation measure.
   - One member argued that *building an AI off of dishonesty is a failure*, while another countered that censoring specific topics isn't a significant issue as the model excels in other areas and that one could access a [DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model that has been post-trained by Perplexity AI to remove Chinese Communist Party censorship](https://huggingface.co/perplexity-ai/r1-1776/tree/main).
- **OpenAI's Defense Partnerships Stir Ethical Concerns**: Members reacted to news that **OpenAI is working with the military and defense industry**, a reversal of their original stance, and their [new partnership with Anduril](https://openai.com/blog/anduril-industries-and-openai-to-bring-ai-powered-innovation-to-the-defense-sector).
   - Some find the lack of oversight and potential for weaponization concerning, while others mention Ilya Sutskever, the ex-Chief Scientist of OpenAI who left to start his own safety-focused AI company, Safe Superintelligence (SSI).

> `Framework desktop, Unified RAM, AMD Ryzen AI, GPU Pricing` 


- **Framework Desktop Gains Traction**: A user pre-ordered a [Framework desktop](https://frame.work/desktop) to experiment with **LM Studio server** and **Tailscale** for an iPhone chat app, Docker, and webservers.
   - Some expressed concerns about waiting until summer for the product, with one noting it will likely be joined by a dozen other mini PCs with the same SoC by then.
- **Framework Desktop's Unified RAM Intriguing**: The [Framework desktop](https://frame.work/desktop) features **unified RAM** between the CPU and GPU, offering up to **128GB** of shared memory, with approximately **90GB** available for the GPU.
   - One user likened it to a MAC setup, highlighting the appeal of unified RAM in a PC.
- **GMK's Ryzen AI Max Mini-PC Unveiled**: [GMK](https://wccftech.com/gmk-announces-worlds-first-mini-pc-based-on-amd-ryzen-ai-9-max/) announced the world's first mini-PC based on **AMD Ryzen AI 9 Max+ 395**, expected to hit the market in the first or second quarter.
   - This mini-PC will feature **Zen 5 architecture** with up to a **16-core/32-thread** configuration and powerful integrated graphics based on the **RDNA 3.5 architecture**.
- **AMD's GPU Pricing Strategy Under Scrutiny**: A [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekKQyrgkd3c) urges AMD to aggressively price its upcoming **RX 9070** and **9070 XT GPUs** to gain market share from Nvidia.
   - The video highlights Nvidia's **90% GPU market share** and argues that AMD should undercut Nvidia significantly to capitalize on recent missteps, instead of its typical *Nvidia minus $50* strategy.

> `Claude Annual Subscriptions, Microsoft Phi-4 Models, GPT-4.5 System Card, OpenAI Livestream, Meta AI Standalone App` 


- **Claude Pro Annual Plan Promo**: Anthropic is experimenting with a new **Claude** web app promotion, offering a *limited time offer* for a year of **Claude Pro** at a special price if switching to an annual plan by a specific end date, prompting a reminder not to buy annual subs for AI services from a user.
   - As another user notes, they have been there, done that, and regretted and never used an annual subscription before.
- **Microsoft Launches Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini**: Microsoft announced the **Phi-4 family** of small language models (**SLMs**), including **Phi-4-multimodal** (processes speech, vision, and text) and **Phi-4-mini** (excels in text-based tasks), available in [Azure AI Foundry](https://aka.ms/try-phi), [HuggingFace](https://aka.ms/phi-4-multimodal/hf), and the [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://aka.ms/phi-4-multimodal/nvidia).
   - Some users doubt claims that it has similar multimodal performance to **Gemini Flash** lite, and also that Microsoft should rename the product line, as they will never escape their *karmic stain*.
- **Leaked GPT-4.5 System Card**: A user shared the **GPT-4.5 System Card**, indicating that interacting with **GPT-4.5 feels more natural** and that *internal testers report GPT-4.5 is warm, intuitive, and natural*. The [system card](https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-4-5-system-card.pdf) notes that it's OpenAI's largest LLM, improving GPT-4's computational efficiency by more than 10x.
   - A user calls the card very boring, while another interprets the card to indicate a **GPT4.5**: creative writooor while **Sonnet 3.5** is a problem solver.
- **OpenAI launches GPT-4.5, Character gets Mainstream**: OpenAI launched **GPT-4.5** as a research preview, available to OpenAI Pro users and API developers with image + text in, text out and same context as 4o model, trained till June 2024. [Here is the official announcement](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/).
   - One user says character/personality is becoming a mainstream topic, and OpenAI *aggressively used low-precision training*.  Another questions how big is the model with that pricing.
- **GPT-4.5 Performance and Pricing Cause Community Reactions**: Early benchmarks of **GPT-4.5** show it being outperformed by **o1** on several problems, indicating pre-training isn't the optimal place to spend compute in 2025, but one user notes the hallucination metrics are very good.  Pricing of **GPT-4.5** is expensive at $75.00 per million input tokens and $150/million for output, prompting one user to state this must be the end of scaling.
   - Another user believes in 1-2 years this will be the default model size.

- **Anthropic Accused of Data Collection Shenanigans**: A user accused **Anthropic** of *sneaky* data collection from the Computer Use API, using it to train classifiers for corporate ethical guidelines, and updating their website to appear transparent, according to [this fxtwitter thread](https://fxtwitter.com/elder_plinius/status/1895177131576918200).
- **Alignment Monitoring's Data Origins Unclear**: It was inferred that **Anthropic** used user data based on their [summarization for monitoring blogpost](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/summarization-for-monitoring/); although, a user pointed out that the data source for training remains unspecified.

> `Claude Code access and potential uses, DeepEP analysis, AI competing on Pokemon Red%, Claude 3.7 Sonnet RL issues` 


- ****Claude Code** Craze & Obsidian Integration**: A member is curious about **Claude Code** access and is considering using it within their Obsidian vault, coupled with Google Calendar and Gmail MCPs, to [organize their life](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1Cz7oQbVkPMam3eoKQWz0w).
- ****DeepEP** Deconstructed & Hardware Caveats**: A member shared an analysis of **DeepEP**, noting it as a valuable work with many details to learn from, but also pointing out [hardware limitations](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1Cz7oQbVkPMam3eoKQWz0w) that are better understood in conjunction with suggestions from the DeepSeek-V3 paper.
- ****MissingNo** Mayhem & Model Misbehavior**: A member joked about AI companies competing on **Pokemon Red%**, predicting a model will exploit a bug like *MissingNo*, causing safety concerns due to widespread guides, even suggesting the possibility of China releasing such a model in real life.
   - This comment was followed by a link to a [depressing result from Claude](https://claude.ai/share/7962a1cc-ddb8-40db-8423-faa0dc826d10), where the implementation doesn't stick to the reasoning trace; another user noted that R1 can do this more reliably, with a [sample Claude output](https://claude.ai/share/daa388d6-5a77-4e75-ba51-769402e5bb8d).
- ****Sonnet 3.7** Stumbles & Rule Rejection**: A member shared their experience using **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** in Cursor, finding it over-confident and prone to ignoring rules, echoing [Catalin's sentiments](https://x.com/alex_peys/status/1895179492664156277) of the model being worse than 3.5 due to its addiction to the reward signal.
   - This was juxtaposed against the expectation of a higher-EQ *beeeg 4.5 model*, with a link to a [tweet celebrating teortaxes' victory](https://x.com/jakehalloran1/status/1895199906387955714).

- **Speak AI's Novel Exponential Revenue**: Paul Graham shared a [revenue graph](https://x.com/paulg/status/1894827577325560215) showing a novel variant of exponential growth, where a company selling a *new year's resolution* product sees sustained usage due to its effectiveness.
   - Swyx noted this observation, highlighting the company's unique growth pattern.
- **Hume AI Releases Octave Text-to-Speech LLM**: Hume AI launched [Octave](https://x.com/hume_ai/status/1894833497824481593), a new **LLM** for text-to-speech that can design voices with prompts and control emotion and delivery, with a creator studio for long-form content production.
   - It understands how meaning affects delivery to generate emotional, human-like speech, unlike traditional TTS systems.
- **Inception Labs releases Mercury dLLM**: Inception Labs introduced [Mercury](https://x.com/InceptionAILabs/status/1894847919624462794), the first commercial-grade **diffusion large language model (dLLM)**, which promises parallel, coarse-to-fine text generation.
   - Karpathy commented that this model has the potential to be different, and possibly showcase new, unique psychology, or new strengths and weaknesses, [encouraging people to try it out](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1894923254864978091).
- **MCP: Tool Calling Renaissance**: There are contrasting views on MCP's value prop, Greg Kamradt suggests developers *jump on the Anthropic MCP train and build*, while others find *the dev experience sucks*.
   - Members defined **MCP as a tool call with your own tools**, or potentially use tools other people have built without wanting to figure out their *underlying* API.
- **Karpathy Teaches LLMs**: Andrej Karpathy released a [2h11m YouTube video](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1895242932095209667) on *How I Use LLMs*, covering a practical guide to the **LLM ecosystem** with examples, including tool use, file uploads, audio/video I/O, memory, and custom GPTs.

- **New Scaling Laws HOT SWAP**: OpenAI presentation introduces *new scaling laws*, indicating a change in the *ratio between data and param size* in the post-training stage.
   - They asked themselves during the presentation *are we hitting a wall*.
- **GPT-4.5 Skips API, aims for Therapy**: The new model doesn't have an API, and is focused on heavy-tail, real world edge cases like responding to angry texts, and better use cases.
   - Members were unimpressed with GPT-4.5's example use cases (*everyday queries including texts to send to your friends*).
- **Sonnet 3.7 Overconfident Ignoring Rules**: A member claimed that **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** is worse than **3.5**, as it is *over-confident*, *ignores rules*, and *unnecessarily does more than it needs to do and therefore breaks the code*.

> `Apple Intelligence Underwhelming, Efficient CoT, GPT-4.5, MoE Models, Wan2.1 video model` 


- **Wan2.1 rises as Stable Diffusion moment for video**: The release of [Wan2.1](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1), an open and advanced large-scale video generative model, has been hailed as *the stable diffusion moment* for video models.
- **Experiments on efficient CoT with Reward Models**: Members discussed methods to make long **Chain of Thought (CoT)** more efficient, including using another LLM to make CoTs more concise and defining a reward function that rewards efficient thoughts, but the consensus is that this is the *problem of the year*.
   - Suggestions included ideas such as **latent CoTs**, **MoE models**, and optimizing for the correct outcome while minimizing excess reasoning tokens; but everyone is noticing that Process Reward Models *kinda suck*.
- **MoE Models Prove Speedier on CPUs**: Members tested **Mixtral**, **Granite**, and **DeepSeek R1** against models such as **Llama 3.2** and **OLMoE**, showing that MoE models are faster and lose less performance when going to pure CPU execution.
   - One user notes that they *highly* recommend **OLMoE** to be thrown on smaller CPU only devices, like a **16GB Raspberry Pi** because there is still value in getting answers back effectively instantly.
- **GPT-4.5 release underwhelming**: **GPT-4.5** has been released, being described as a very large and compute-intensive model, making it more expensive than and not a replacement for **GPT-4o**, with Sam Altman stating that this model *feels like talking to a thoughtful person*.
   - Karpathy claims it has **10x more pretraining compute than GPT-4**, however its use case might be limited given it is overfit on the river crossing puzzle, and more geared towards creative use cases.
- **Apple Intelligence: Big Shift or Big Miss?**: Members discussed **Apple Intelligence**, with some believing it is underwhelming, and also a big shift away from the money coming from business API use over to the money coming from consumers, while one mentioned they're in an *edge-inference-first trap*.
   - Members note that Apple focused on use cases possible with on-device constraints, while everyone else just tried to make AI as good as possible, suggesting **Apple** should have been first on this, but *messed it up*.

> `Language Models, REFUTE benchmark, algorithmic problem solving` 


- **Language Models to accelerate science?**: Language Models (LMs) have the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by helping to falsify hypotheses and refine claims iteratively.
   - Current benchmarks for LMs assess their ability to generate solutions rather than challenge them.
- **Introducing REFUTE Benchmark for Algorithmic Problem Solving**: A new dynamically updating benchmark called **REFUTE** is introduced to assess LMs' ability to generate counterexamples for incorrect solutions in [algorithmic problem solving](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.19414).
   - It includes recent problems and incorrect submissions from programming competitions, where human experts successfully identified counterexamples.
- **LMs struggle with verification on REFUTE**: Analysis of the **REFUTE** benchmark reveals that even the best reasoning agents succeed in finding counterexamples only **9%** of the time.
   - This suggests that verification can be significantly harder than generation for language models.

> `ReAct Agent Integration, DSPy Release Bug, MIPROv2 Optimizer Error, Refine API Feedback, Community Engagement` 


- **ReAct Agent juggles external tools**: A user questioned how to integrate tools requiring external pings with **dspy.ReAct** for complex tasks like creating text and sending emails, especially concerning orchestration.
   - The challenge lies in ensuring the system understands the sequence of actions (text creation before email) when email function requires external function calls.
- **DSPy Release 2.6.7 bugs out, Imports vanish**: Users reported a **ModuleNotFoundError** in **dspy-ai==2.6.7**, with a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/issues/7867) detailing the import failure.
   - Downgrading to version **2.6.6** resolved the issue; the faulty release was quickly yanked, and **2.6.8** was released to address the import problems caused by a migration from setup.py to pyproject.toml.
- **MIPROv2 optimizer hits context limits**: A user encountered a **ContextWindowExceededError** with **MIPROv2**, even after ensuring conversations were under 1000 characters and using *light* mode.
   - It was suggested that the user reduce the number of demos in the optimizer or set `view_data_batch_size=3` in the `.compile()` call to address the token limit issue, this setting was required to reduce the data summary size.
- **Refine API evolves feedback loops**: A user inquired about how to control advice/feedback passed to the LLM on subsequent retries with **dspy.Refine**, compared to older assertion methods.
   - Feedback will be returned in the `reward_fn`, and that `dspy.Refine` should now participate in the compilation feedback mechanism, allowing for optimization of previously unoptimizable suggestions.
- **Community yearns for signal from noise**: Concerns were raised about getting quality feedback from a large Discord community to improve DSPy and avoid *too many knobs*.
   - The proposition of weekly open calls/meetings was floated, along with the idea of short posts or PRs offering feedback from production use, similar to examples in the Discord channels.

> `CI troubles, Activation Offloading, Distributed Torch FL Code, DPO Integration Test` 


- **CI run requested for PR#2419**: A member requested someone to start CI for [PR#2419](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/pull/2419) without merging, as they are making a *last attempt for today*.
   - The PR in question regards *truncation and skipping*.
- **Activation Offloading and Checkpointing**: A member inquired whether there is a reason why **activation offloading** can only be used in conjunction with **activation checkpointing**.
   - Another member explained that activations require *waaaay more memory* than just the checkpoints, which in their case is just the input vector to the transformer block, so *offloading and loading them will throttle GPU* and make it unbearably slow.
- **Handling Merged Model Loading in Distributed FL**: A member sought advice on handling merged model loading in **distributed Federated Learning (FL)** code, particularly how to avoid downloading the merged model on all ranks.
   - They considered dumping the merged model to disk and having all ranks load from the disk, and was recommended to use **shared memory** instead.
- **Bullying pre-commit**: A member mentioned being *bullied by pre-commit again* while trying to implement Federated Learning. The relevant function in question resides [here](https://github.com/maximegmd/torchtune/blob/d5dc4e6027ec0de33f6ffdc2eb1eee2148a1fb69/torchtune/training/federation/_participant.py#L171).
   - The member expressed relief after managing to go through it: *pls dont 🥲*
- **DPO Integration Test Status**: A member asked about the status of the **DPO integration test**, wondering why there was a problem adding it.
   - Another member replied that there is currently one for the single device recipe, referencing [this file](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/blob/7cbac8173edecd7f801bbbe9ee67adf00d6261c6/tests/recipes/test_lora_dpo_single_device.py), clarifying there shouldn't be any issue adding for distributed recipe too.

- **Users request Emoji Options for Notebooks**: Users requested the ability to change emojis on their notebooks, but the feature is currently unavailable, but it was suggested to support existing feature requests or create new ones. There are many strong options against OneNote, Obsidian, and Goodnotes.
   - One user pointed to a [tweet](https://x.com/signulll/status/1894806791172559355?t=M_rcWIE4NHsrLy8Ry3DzKA&s=19) lamenting **NotebookLM's** lack of momentum and mobile apps, blaming Google's pattern of stifling internal innovation.
- **Notebook Sharing Shenanigans**: Users are encountering issues sharing notebooks with groups, finding that simply handing over the link is insufficient, as they need to add users specifically to grant access.
   - It seems that users may need to have an account before they can access a shared notebook, and both adding the user via email and providing the link might be necessary.
- **Audio Overview Agony**: Users are frequently encountering an error saying *“There was an error fetching your conversation. Please try again.”* when trying to load the audio overview.
   - The issue seems intermittent, working sometimes but failing frequently, causing frustration among users who rely on this feature.
- **User reports 'Service Unavailable' Error**: A user reported receiving a *'Service unavailable'* error when logging into NotebookLM, with a message indicating that *'You tried to access a service that isn't available for your account'*, and linked to their [Google Account services page](https://accounts.google.com/info/servicerestricted).

- **Mojo Hyperlogs with Github!**: A member implemented the **HyperLogLog algorithm** in Mojo and shared it on [GitHub](https://github.com/axiomhq/mojo-hyperloglog), seeking suggestions for improvement.
   - They express enjoyment in using Mojo, describing it as *a more powerful Python*.
- **MAX uses undocumented MLIR**: Members discussed the use of inline **MLIR** in the stdlib, which is largely undocumented and intended for internal use by Modular and stdlib contributors.
   - It's implied that the in-house dialects `mo`, `moq`, `mogg`, `mef`, `mgp`, `grt`, `rmo` are not intended to be exposed to the general public.
- **Exploring Internal Mojo Dialects**: A member explored Mojo's internals using `nm` to discover and list details related to **dialects, types, and ops** within `libmof.so`.
   - This exploration revealed the `union` type, prompting discussion about its intended use and potential hazards due to poorly defined **aliasing and type-punning rules**.
- **MAX graph compiler uses mlir dialects**: A member clarified that specific MLIR dialects (like `mo`) are primarily used by the **MAX Graph Compiler** and are not part of Mojo's runtime.
   - These dialects are relevant for **graph compilation only**, with no current way to manually load them into Mojo's MlirContext.
- **Stability concerns for mojo's MLIR**: Stability and documentation efforts are reasons why some MLIR dialects aren't publicly available, as they include aspects critical to Modular's competitive advantage, and completely documenting them could dilute their value.
   - A member noted once Modular is more established, they can afford to open things up since it will be easier to use their system than to replicate it.

> `Redmine MCP Server, Ableton Voice Control, tinylm library for running LLMs` 


- **MCP Redmine Lands with Great API Coverage**: A new [MCP Redmine server](https://github.com/runekaagaard/mcp-redmine) has been released, boasting coverage of nearly the entire **Redmine json API** in under 50 lines of code.
   - The server utilizes the **gh user d-yoshi OpenAPI specification**, according to reports.
- **Ableton Voice Control Dreams Surface**: A member expressed enthusiasm for the MCP Redmine and imagined controlling **Ableton** via voice commands, suggesting a workflow like *'Ok now lets record a new track using input7 with a bit of reverb added and routed to output 3+4.'*
   - Another member noted that while direct loading of devices isn't possible with **Ableton remote control scripts**, a **Whisper routine** paired with a custom **Ableton MCP client** could achieve this.
- **tinylm Powers Client-Side LLMs in Browser**: Version 0 of [tinylm](https://github.com/wizenheimer/tinylm) was released, a library for running **LLMs** and embedding models client-side in the browser or Node.js with **WebGPU acceleration**, supporting an OpenAI-compatible API.
   - tinylm touts **zero-cost inference**, complete privacy, and features like text generation, text embeddings, and real-time token streaming.

> `Live Mode, Voice Assistant, GGUF models, Alltalk TTS` 


- **Request for LIVE mode feature**: A member requested a **LIVE mode** feature similar to **Google Gemini**, suggesting it would surpass Google's tools.
   - They proposed using **voice recognition (STT)** for input and **TTS** for output, linking a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zAk0KHmiGw) demonstrating a **GPT4ALL Voice Assistant** built in Python that utilizes **OpenAI Whisper** for offline voice detection.
- **Comprehending Chat Templates for GGUF Models**: A member inquired about the usage of **chat_template** with **GGUF models**, questioning if the template is read from the **.gguf** file on initial load and stored in **model3.json**.
   - They sought confirmation that changes made in the **GUI** are saved in **model3.json**, as observed with **gpt4all** and **Hugging Face** models.
- **Oobabooga implements Alltalk TTS**: A member mentioned that [Oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) implements a **text-to-speech** extension called **alltalk_tts** that functions with **GGUF**, **AWQ**, and **GPTQ** models.
   - They noted the installation is somewhat tricky, involving a **Python installation** with a **BAT install**, but requires no coding.
- **Internet speed impacts installation time**: A member lamented their slow internet speed of **40 kbps**, which would make the [Oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) installation take approximately **two days**.
   - The other member had said the install takes **one hour**.

> `GROUP operations AST changes, BEAM search strategies for OptOps, arange GROUP optimization failure, LLVM speed regression` 


- **GROUP AST changes hit performance **blocker****: Changes to the AST for **GROUP operations** have reached parity with PyTorch when summing (2048,2048) tensors but struggle with (4096,4096) tensors due to the need for **multiple successive OptOps**.
   - The author asks whether they should attempt to adjust **BEAM search** to find these OptOps or modify the **lowerer/expander** to output something different that will do **multiple accumulators**.
- **BEAM Search Stalls Out, **Frustrates Progress****: The author is facing challenges getting **BEAM search** to find the optimal sequence of **OptOps** needed for efficient summation of larger tensors (4096,4096).
   - They are considering modifying the **lowerer** or **expander** to generate alternative ASTs that could better utilize multiple accumulators and horizontal add swizzles but express uncertainty about guaranteeing performance improvements.
- **arange GROUP Optimization, **Breaks CI****: The author reports that the `arange` **GROUP optimization** is not being applied, leading to an extra inner loop in arange operations and broken CI.
   - They rebased onto master and tests are passing, with successful matching of pytorch, asking for any advice there might be on the `arange` **GROUP optimization**.
- **Speed Test BEAM=2 **Times Out****: A member noticed that "Speed Test BEAM=2" is timing out [on GitHub Actions](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/actions/runs/13555381099/job/37888418102?pr=9190).
   - The author fixed this issue by trimming some of the added OptOps and also reported that adding **GROUP** and **GROUPTOP** slowed the **BEAM search** due to greatly increased number of kernels tried.
- **Tests still failing on **Pull Request****: A member said that the tests are still failing on the pull request and the code is also a lot slower on **LLVM** speed with **0 gain**.
   - The author clarified that they were not asking for a review yet, but wanted to know if the arange tests failing on **GROUP OptOps** was a known issue.
