<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Yay for open weights models!**

> AI News for 3/14/2025-3/17/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **28** Discords (**223** channels, and **9014** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **990 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

We briefly mentioned Cohere's Command A launch [last week](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-not-much-happened-today-8188/), but since the announcement was comparatively light on broadly comparable benchmarks (there were some, but the selective, self reported, comparisons to DeepSeek V3 and GPT-4o couldnt really contextualize Command A among either SOTA open source or overall SOTA-for-size), it was hard to tell where it would rank in terms of lasting impact. 

With today's LMArena result, that is no longer in question:

As [Aidan Gomez points out](https://x.com/aidangomez/status/1901669060175151609), Command A actually *increases* 2 spots in rankings with the Style Control modifier (explored on [their LS podcast](https://www.latent.space/p/lmarena)).

There are many other notable subtle points that make Command A a particularly attractive candidate to include in one's open models arsenal, including the unusually long 256k context window, multilingual capabilities, and focus on optimizing for a 2-H100 serving footprint.

- **Llama-server Lacks Vision**: It was noted that **llama-server** doesn't support vision yet with a reference to an [llmbingo.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1179039861576056922/1350535747794636923/llmbingo.png?ex=67d9baee&is=67d8696e&hm=ab080a6e00a4974612ac334535b69490706b3a3b8d3006a31a0f1986f83240e7&).
- **RWKV-7 Support Wishlisted**: A member expressed great enthusiasm for **RWKV-7** support in Unsloth, stating, *"if unsloth has rwkv 7 support i would go nuts".*
- **The Great Q4 vs Q8 debate**: Members discussed the tradeoffs between **Q4** and **Q8** quantization for inference, with one preferring **8b @ bf16** over **70b @ Q4** due to perceived quality differences.
   - Another member agreed, pointing out issues with converting from 4-bit to 16-bit GGUF formats.
- **bnb Library Hinders Dequantization**: It was argued that the dependency on wrappers such as the **bnb library** is limiting the potential of the dequantization of Unsloth.
   - The member suggested researching and implementing a custom solution from scratch, citing the challenges due to CUDA not being open source, and sharing [an article on QLoRA dequantization](https://lweitkamp.github.io/posts/qlora_dequantize).
- **Triton Kernels for QLoRA Dequantization**: A member highlighted Unsloth's challenge of writing a **Triton kernel** for dequantizing **QLoRA NF4** quantized weights, referencing [Unsloth's list of challenging tasks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JqKqA1XWeLHvnYAc0wzrR4JBCnq43HyH?usp=sharing#scrollTo=QoE2DGRZG2Ng).
   - They also shared [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/lweitkamp/qlora_dequantize_triton) containing Triton kernels and a benchmark notebook, claiming performance improvements of up to **1.6X** to **1.8X** for LLaMA models.

> `Gemma 3 Finetuning Issues, Unsloth GPU Support, RAG Data Formatting for Unsloth, lora upload issue, text dataset formatting` 


- **Gemma 3 FP32 Finetuning Fix**: A member identified that **Gemma 3 models** can only be finetuned in **FP32** for now, and commented out/set to false these lines to prevent `AttributeError: 'HybridCache' object has no attribute 'float'`.
   - Another member also confirmed that `fp16 = True` doesn't work.
- **Unsloth Multi-GPU Support Coming Soon**: A member inquired about multi-GPU support in Unsloth, with a response indicating it is coming in the **next few weeks**, with <a href="https://unsloth.ai/newsletter">a link to the newsletter</a>.
   - One of the Unsloth developers mentioned *"we said next few weeks ahaha not this week"*.
- **Format your RAG data as Q&A pairs**: When asked about finetuning a model for a RAG chatbot, members suggested to add sample questions and sample answers to a dataset with context from the documents for the Q&A to inject new knowledge into the bot.
   - It was suggested that a chatbot data should follow a `Q: A:` format, and can use a CPT-style training with documents added on the user side.
- **lora upload is only base model**: A member reported a problem when uploading a trained **LoRA** model to Hugging Face.
   - Other members asked whether the user used `lora_model.push_to_hub_merged` and if the problem was caused by the size of the model or testing the model.
- **Problems with text data formatting**: A member was facing a `TypeError` because of `NoneType` objects during training from a Gemini-generated dataset.
   - Members clarified that this error could result from empty entries in the dataset, and it is best to check the `json` file.

> `Gemma-3-think model, Qwen 2.5 3B instruct, Gemma-3-27b pruned vocab` 


- **Gemma-3-think reasons with Thinking Tags**: The [Gemma-3-think-0.1-q5_k_m](https://huggingface.co/Ba2han/gemma-3-think-0.1-q5_k_m) model was trained on **2.1k examples** and uses `<think>` tags to trigger reasoning.
   - The model can work with image data even though it was not explicitly trained to do so. Model was finetuned with Unsloth!
- **Qwen 2.5 3B shows promising Multi-Turn GRPO**: Early results of the **Qwen 2.5 3B** instruct model on the GSM8K test set with **Multi-Turn GRPO training** are showing promise at step **100** with **52%** accuracy.
   - After a few more training steps, the accuracy dropped to **40-46%**.
- **Gemma-3-27b gets a pruned vocabulary**: A member pruned the [Gemma-3-27b](https://huggingface.co/fimbulvntr/gemma-3-27b-pt-unsloth-bnb-4bit-pruned-vocab) vocabulary down to **40k tokens** from the original **260k** to reduce VRAM usage and increase training speed.
   - The approach involved frequency counting based on calibration data and removing the least frequently used tokens that can be represented by a merge/subword.

> `Context Length vs. Model Size, Fine-tuning and Hosting Alternatives to Unsloth, Continued Pre-training and Tokenizer Updates, LLM Scoring on the Political Spectrum, Legal Q&A with Tree-Based Retrieval` 


- **Context Length not a Hyperparameter, but a Limit**: A member clarified that maximum **context length** is a **limitation** rather than a **hyperparameter** of a model, and depends on memory needs.
   - Another member provided [Unsloth's benchmarks](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-benchmarks#context-length-benchmarks) and a link on [calculating GPU memory](https://www.substratus.ai/blog/calculating-gpu-memory-for-llm).
- **Runpod and Vast.ai: Fine-Tuning and Hosting Havens**: A user sought alternatives to Unsloth for fine-tuning and hosting **Deepseek R1** or **Gemma 3**, and [Runpod.io](https://runpod.io) was recommended.
   - Another user mentioned other options like **Lamda** and noted that [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai) is cheap but potentially unstable, while Runpod has storage limitations on their community cloud.
- **Token Tango: Update Tokenizers for Domain-Specific Jargon**: A member inquired about updating the **tokenizer** during continued pre-training for specialized domains to handle words not trained by the base model.
   - Another member suggested searching for *"tokenizer add tokens"* and linked to a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/s/6e3CohiNNm) about adding new tokens to **LLaMA 2** models.
- **LLMs Judge Politics: Scoring Text on the Political Spectrum**: A user asked if **Unsloth** could be used to fine-tune an **LLM** to score text on the political spectrum from **-1.0 to +1.0**.
   - A member responded that using the prepared dataset with outputs as literal strings from -1.0 to 1.0 might work.
- **Navigating Legal LLMs with Tree-Based Knowledge**: A user working on a legal **Q&A** problem asked for advice on building a **tree-based retrieval engine** for contexts around **80k**.
   - They referenced the [RAPTOR study](https://x.com/JJitsev/status/1901467121592201490) and two options were building a tree similar to the RAPTOR study or building a tree where child nodes are included in the parent node.

> `Cursor vs Windsurf, Claude 3.7 pricing, Linux better than Windows for MCP and dev, vibe coding` 


- **Windsurf Steals Cursor's Customers**: Several users have expressed frustration with Cursor's performance, particularly its lag and crashing issues, leading some to consider switching to [Windsurf](https://www.windsurf.ai).
   - One user even stated, *damn, cursor just lost their most important customer* after experiencing ongoing problems, indicating a significant loss of confidence in Cursor's reliability.
- **Cursor's Prompting Costs**: Members discussed the cost of prompts for Claude 3.7, with regular prompts priced at **$0.04**, Sonnet Thinking at **$0.08**, and Claude Max at **$0.05** per prompt and tool call.
   - Some users expressed concerns that Cursor's pricing is becoming too expensive compared to using Claude's API directly, questioning the value proposition of Cursor's subscription.
- **Linux MCP > Windows MCP**: A user shared their experience setting up MCP servers on both Linux and Windows, noting that Linux (specifically using a VMware virtual machine) was much smoother and easier to set up compared to the multiple issues encountered on Windows.
   - This led to the question of whether overall development and MCP server setup are generally better on Linux than Windows, sparking a discussion about the pros and cons of each operating system for development.
- **Vibe Coding, good or bad?**: Some are saying  Vibe Coding is bad, as they emphasize the importance of solid coding knowledge, while others assert that AI enables them to create things faster, even without traditional coding skills.
   - This debate highlights the evolving landscape of software development and the varying perspectives on how AI is impacting the industry.
- **Claude Max, soon to be released**: <@1001207432640462868> from the Cursor team announced that [Claude Max](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-3) is coming very soon, and that it should unlock it's full potential with the amount of code it can handle.
   - That model works better with more input than past models, so this should "unlock" its full potential.

> `Scalable AI, Mixture of Experts, Mistral Small 3.1, LLM Copyright issues, LLM Training` 


- **Scaling AI: Is Latency Becoming a Bottleneck?**: As AI models scale, some researchers believe **training and inference will become more latency sensitive**, potentially shifting towards message-passing paradigms instead of traditional gradient-based methods.
   - These evolving paradigms could make **latency and bandwidth critical factors** in AI development, particularly as neural networks capture more ideas and accessing information from the network becomes more expensive.
- **MoE: Dense Networks' Stealthy Sparsity**: Researchers are exploring **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** models as a way to approximate dense networks, with some arguing that they are simply a performance optimization rather than a fundamentally different architecture, citing work such as [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10837).
   - The discussion revolves around whether MoEs can capture complexity as effectively as dense networks, with one participant noting that despite claims that MoEs are an optimization, there is clearly some redundancy that is avoided**.
- **Mistral Small 3.1: The New 24B Contender**: **Mistral Small 3.1** has been released under an Apache 2.0 license, and is a multimodal model that can handle text, images, and an expanded **128k token context window**.
   - The new model is claimed to surpass other small models like Gemma 3 and GPT-4o Mini in performance, as shown [on the Mistral AI blog](https://mistral.ai/en/news/mistral-small-3-1).
- **Copyright Concerns in the AI Age**: Debates continue regarding the ethical and legal implications of training AI models on copyrighted data, with some suggesting that **fully open models** are hindered by the inability to use resources like the entirety of Anna's Archive.
   - Strategies to circumvent copyright restrictions include using **LoRAs** to fine-tune models on copyrighted material or generating synthetic data from a knowledgable model, though these methods may face legal challenges in the future as it was discussed in this [Annas Archive's blogpost](https://annas-archive.org/blog/ai-copyright.html).
- **Optimum GPU count and methods**: There are many ways to optimize training when using certain hardware configurations, and more GPUs always provides a qualitative improvement.
   - It was speculated that there may be an **optimal point** where trading dev time for compute comes up short.

> `Curse of Depth in LLMs, LayerNorm Scaling, LLMs competing in text-only games, Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation Model` 


- ****Depth's Curse** strikes LLMs!**: A new paper introduces the concept of the **Curse of Depth** in modern **LLMs**, where nearly half the layers are less effective than expected, as detailed in [this Arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05795).
   - The paper identifies that the underlying reason is the widespread usage of **Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN)**, which causes the derivative of deep Transformer blocks to be an identity matrix.
- ****Scaling LayerNorm** to the Rescue**: To resolve the training pitfall caused by Pre-LN, the paper proposes **LayerNorm Scaling**, which scales the layer normalization to improve the effectiveness of deeper layers, as described in [this Arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05795).
- ****LLMs duke it out** in Text-Only Games**: A member shared their paper where they had **LLMs compete against each other in a text-only game** to improve them, available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IIqxolKNn3cbQ9DaKTYqx5WIvJ04twTP/view).
- ****LayerNorm dissected****: A member asked if LayerNorm is *the act of taking the coordinates of each embedded token as a distribution, and normalizing that*.
   - Another member confirmed that they *got it exactly right*.
- ****Hebbian Consolidation** model prevents catastrophic forgetting**: A paper introduces a **Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation model** to tackle catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios, detailed in [this Arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16558).

> `Aider screen recordings, Claude 3.7 Sonnet issues, MCP server value, Baidu ERNIE 4.5 & X1 Models, Aider Custom Commands` 


- **Aider Enhancements Showcased in New Screen Recordings**: Paul Gauthier has published a series of [screen recordings](https://aider.chat/docs/recordings/) demonstrating aider's use in enhancing itself, including adding the **`--auto-accept-architect`** feature, integrating **tree-sitter-language-pack**, and preventing the dropping of read-only files.
   - The recordings provide insight into how aider can be used to script downloading files and using ad-hoc bash scripts to modify file collections.
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet faces API Issues**: Multiple users reported receiving *empty responses* from **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**, prompting checks of their provider accounts, with some experiencing the same issue in **Claude Code**.
   - The issue was confirmed by [Anthropic's status page](https://status.anthropic.com/), citing elevated errors and later marking the incident as resolved, while some members suspected a switch to Claude 3.5 due to the errors.
- **MCP Server for Aider Gaining Traction**: A user highlighted that **Claude Desktop + Aider on MCP** equals *winning*, and it's much more autonomous, easier since claude manages Aider and gives it commands.
   - A main benefit highlighted is the ability to run **Aider** from **Claude Desktop**, making it more autonomous and allowing Claude to steer Aider more effectively, also scraping bee is a game changer for doing unblocked web scraping and this drastically improves claude.
- **Baidu Unveils ERNIE 4.5 and X1**: Baidu has announced the release of **ERNIE 4.5** and **X1**, a reasoning model with multimodal capabilities, with X1 delivering performance on par with **DeepSeek R1** at half the price, and **ERNIE Bot** being made free to individual users.
   - While **ERNIE 4.5** is available, the reasoning model **X1** is currently not accessible through the API outside of China.
- **Users Suggest Custom Commands for Aider**: A user suggested adding custom commands to Aider via Python scripts to extend functionality, particularly for context building, which the user finds cumbersome with the current UX.
   - One suggested command example was `grepadd.py` to interactively toggle files and substrings found via grep, converting these selections into Aider commands, but there's already an [open PR for user_cmd](https://github.com/whitmo/aider).

> `Refact.ai Leaderboard Claim, Claude Harmony Feature, Qwen Models Hype` 


- **Refact.ai Claims Top Spot on Aider's Polyglot Benchmark - Controversy Ensues**: [Refact.ai](https://refact.ai/blog/2025/refact-ai-agent-claude-3-7-sonnet-ranked-1-aider-polyglot/) claimed their **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** powered agent achieved a **76.4%** score on **Aider's polyglot benchmark**, surpassing other models.
   - Paul Gauthier, the creator of Aider, stated that *it's not an appropriate comparison* because Refact.ai used a different, more *agentic* configuration than the standard Aider benchmark which allows for unlimited retries, whereas Aider's previous SWE-bench scores used only one-shot attempts.
- **Anthropic Teases Claude "Harmony" Feature**: A user shared that [Anthropic](https://x.com/testingcatalog/status/1901051432339730603) is coming out with a new **Harmony** feature for **Claude**.
   - The **Harmony** feature will give **Claude** *FULL access to a local directory* so it can research and operate with its content, potentially making it Anthropic's first AI Agent.
- **Qwen Models Get Some Love**: A user commented that *Qwen's models are my favorite* and they might believe them if they say their models are the best.
   - Another user agreed saying that *They're definitely the best for their parameter size*, especially when compared to models in the 7b-32b range.

> `RTX 8000 vs A6000 for LLM inference, Multiple GPUs for running multiple LLMs, 48GB RTX 4090 from China, AMD Strix Halo APU vs RTX 5080 in AI, Mobo/RAM Choice for AI PC build` 


- **RTX 8000 Still Viable for LLM Inferencing**: Members discussed the **RTX 8000 48GB**, noting its decent value for **LLM inferencing** despite being an older Turing architecture card with fewer cuda cores and lower bandwidth compared to newer cards like the **A6000** and **RTX 6000 ADA**.
   - One member stated that *for inferencing, having large VRAM on one card is a huge advantage over two cards with the same VRAM because it eliminates interactions between GPUs that slow each card down by nearly half.*
- **Multiple GPUs for Multiple LLMs: LM Studio Update Coming?**: Members discussed the possibility of running multiple LLMs on separate GPUs using LM Studio, with one member noting that, *right now_ you'd have to use the tensor cuda thing env variable before running up either GPU* with the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable.
   - Another member hinted at a future LM Studio release that will allow setting GPU affinity within the app itself, linking to [a Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/1110598183144399058/1166577236325965844/1349840104914681997) as evidence.
- **Chinese 48GB RTX 4090s: A Cheap VRAM Boost?**: Members discussed sourcing **48GB RTX 4090s** from China, with prices around **$4500**, noting that they use a blower-style fan and consume only two PCIe slots.
   - However, one member cautioned about driver compatibility issues when combining these cards with professional cards like the **A6000**, stating that *the setup only works if I use a gaming driver from NVidia - the studio professional drivers won't load on the 'gaming' cards.*
- **AMD's Strix Halo APU Could Outperform RTX 5080 in AI**: A member shared an article from wccftech claiming AMD's [Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 "Strix Halo" APU](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-ai-max-395-strix-halo-ultimate-ai-pc-apus-16-zen-5-40-rdna-3-5-cores-256-gbps-bandwidth-120w/) *offering over 3x the boost over RTX 5080 in DeepSeek R1 AI benchmarks*.
   - The claim is based on the APU's larger VRAM pool, with the hope that there will be real world data soon.
- **Optimizing Mobo/RAM choice for AI PC build**: A member requested advice on motherboard/RAM choices for an AI PC build, especially regarding potential PCIe lane conflicts with M.2 drives, with a build based on [this pcpartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/pVMpFZ).
   - Another member suggested that it is not really beneficial to get ram speed faster than **6200** on **AM5** and linked [to a memory kit](https://a.co/d/47pP1DF) while noting that two M.2 drives are mostly idling.

> `GRPO implementation trick, Applying KL penalty in the loss, DAPO algorithm, Zero-shot RL` 


- **GRPO Uses Loss Penalty Trick**: A member discussed a **GRPO implementation trick** that applies a penalty in the loss, as opposed to traditional RLHF which applies it to the reward, noting its impact is hard to determine but may help the model focus on reward signals, as described in the [RLHF book](https://rlhfbook.com/c/11-policy-gradients.html#group-relative-policy-optimization-1).
   - It was also pointed out that the math may be wrong.
- **KL Penalty Placement Gets Questioned**: A member inquired about the effect of applying the **KL penalty directly in the loss** versus when the reward is computed, asking for intuitions or ablations on the subject via [Twitter](https://x.com/natolambert/status/1900639281791615387).
   - The discussion touched upon whether normalization by token helps with learning dynamics, and if a per-token formulation would be "better."
- **Decoupled Algorithm Dominates Deep Reasoning**: A new **DAPO (decoupled clip and dynamic sampling policy optimization) algorithm** and model called **DAPO-Zero-32B** were introduced, outperforming **DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B** on reasoning tasks, achieving a score of 50 on AIME 2024 with fewer steps, and trained with **zero-shot RL** from the Qwen-32b pre-trained model, all open-sourced at [dapo-sia.github.io](https://dapo-sia.github.io/).
   - It was noted that if a reasoning pattern contributes to the reward, its contribution will be much lower if it's part of a long chain of thought under row mean.
- **DAPO Dataset Gets Massive Upscaling**: It was discovered that the authors of **DAPO** accidentally duplicated the dataset by roughly **100x**, which resulted in a dataset of 310 MB, and a member created a deduplicated version via HF's SQL console, reducing the dataset to 3.17 MB ([HuggingFace Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YouJiacheng/DAPO-Math-17k-dedup)).
   - The authors acknowledged the issue, stating that they were aware but *can't afford retraining*.

- **Multi-Agent Systems Topologies Debate Swarm vs Mesh vs Sequence**: A member initiated a discussion on **Swarm**, **Mesh**, and **Sequence** architectures for multi-agent systems, seeking resources and advice, while struggling with sub-agents going off-track due to the *telephone game* effect.
   - One member suggested the problems might relate to *parallel execution and unsupervised autonomy issues*, where the **handoff** of execution between agents includes swapping system instructions, available functions, and even the model or provider being used.
- **OpenSwarm's Evolution into OpenAI-Agents**: A member mentioned working on **OpenSwarm** for a client and its subsequent adoption by OpenAI, rebranded as **openai-agents**, with additional OpenAI-specific features, while noting a rejected PR for MCP support.
   - They also mentioned rumors that **CrewAI** (or **PraisonAI**?) might offer similar functionality using a *stateless single thread agent approach*.

> `Torch Compile, Graph Breaks, Stride Issue, Std::variants in schemas` 


- ****Torch Compile** Struggles With Backward Pass**: A member reported that while **torch.compile** works fine for the forward pass, it is quite slow in the backward pass when using **torch.autograd.Function** for custom kernels.
   - They found that wrapping the backward function with `torch.compile(compiled_backward_fn)` could address this issue.
- ****Graph Breaks** Cause Compile Problems**: It was noted that **graph breaks** in the backward pass can cause issues with **torch.compile**.
   - One member found that using `.stride(0)` in their Triton kernel caused graph breaks, which they resolved by using **constant values** instead.
- ****Stride(0) Issue** Fixed in Nightly Builds**: A member noted that they had issues with `stride(0)` causing graph breaks in their **Triton kernel**.
   - Another member mentioned that the `stride(0)` issue has been fixed in the **PyTorch nightly builds**.
- **Schemas Struggle With **std::variants****: A member inquired about supporting `std::variants` in schemas, linking to the [relevant PyTorch code](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/c7c3e7732443d7994303499bcb01781c9d59ab58/aten/src/ATen/core/op_registration/README.md).
   - A core dev said it's fairly hard, and that they ended up settling for `std::optional`.

   - This is because **LayerNorm** requires reductions for the mean and variance of a sequence, which can be slow, whereas **tanh()** can be calculated on every element in registers and fused with the following matmul/linear layer.
- **tanh isn't cheap, but can be approximated**: One member stated that *`tanh` in itself isn't that cheap*, as it requires an **exp** and a division.
   - On Nvidia hardware there's **`tanh.approx` (since Turing/sm_75)**, which purportedly has a throughput of **16/cycle/SM**.
- **__expf() Is Faster for Small Values**: A member suggested that **`__expf()`** is quite faster but is only good for smaller values.
   - Others pointed out that **FA3** incurred significant overhead due to the **exp** becoming a bottleneck.

> `GPU coalesced access, Nvidia GPU read operation, GPU programming, CUDA learning resources, Installing Triton` 


- **GPU coalesced access vs permuted reads**: When threads (0,1,2,3) read addresses (0,1,2,3) in a GPU, it's coalesced; however, reading at permuted addresses like (2,0,3,1) might result in **4 sequential reads** instead of a single operation.
   - If threads read addresses like **4*i+[0,1,2,3] with random i**, where each thread reads inside its own memory bank at a random address, it is not clear if this is faster than reading with bank conflicts.
- **Nvidia GPU read operations generate single request per warp**: A modern **Nvidia GPU** read operation generates a single request per warp to the **L1TEX/LSUIN**, operating at a sector level (**32 bytes**) with stored cache lines (**4 sectors**).
   - The requests are processed internally in *wavefronts*, with more details available in [Nvidia's developer forums](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/wahts-the-difference-between-wavefronts-and-sectors-req/165293/4) and a [GTC Spring 21 session](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring21-s32089/).
- **Bank conflicts and memory differences explored**: A [GTC Spring 22 session](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring22-s41723/) helps understand bank conflicts.
   - The presenter highlights the differences between the **L1 data cache** (where the return bandwidth is cache line/cycle) and **shared memory** (which depends on bank conflicts).
- **Cloud Resources for GPU Kernel Testing**: For individuals new to GPU programming seeking to test CUDA/Cutlass/Triton kernels without local GPU access, [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) offers free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs.
   - Additionally, [LeetGPU](https://leetgpu.com/) may provide alternative testing environments.

- **Fewshot Split Fallback Scheme Unveiled**: When a fewshot split isn't specified, the system falls back to **train > val > test**, prioritizing the training split if available.
   - This order determines which split is used for evaluation if no specific split is defined.
- **Gen Kwargs Embraces JSON Format**: The `--gen_kwargs` argument is transitioning from comma-separated strings to **JSON**, allowing for more complex configurations like `'{"temperature":0, "stop":["abc"]}'`.
   - The discussion explores the possibility of supporting both formats for ease of use, especially for scalar values.
- **Old vs New LLM Leaderboard: Discrepancy Surfaces**: A discrepancy is identified between the group config for the old LLM leaderboard and the actual setup used, particularly concerning the **arc-challenge task**.
   - The `openllm.yaml` config specifies `validation` as the fewshot split, but the original leaderboard used the `train` split due to the absence of a fewshot split in the old fork's Python class, a [PR to fix this](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/pull/2802) was created to address this discrepancy.

> `Self-reflection and self-refinement in LLMs, System prompts and LLM behavior` 


- **Self-Reflection Dichotomy Dilemma Discussed**: A member highlighted a contradiction between **Lecture 1**, stating that **self-reflection and self-refinement** require external evaluation, and **Lecture 2**, suggesting LLMs can improve by rewarding their own outputs.
   - Screenshots from **Lecture 1, slide 67** and **Lecture 2, slide 51** were attached to illustrate the apparent conflict.  See [image 1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1282734248112947210/1351127068745928816/image.png?ex=67d9e763&is=67d895e3&hm=7d31b7a0583550a36a872d74bfaf765de39c6b1173333d2ce51174940c0aa522&) and [image 2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1282734248112947210/1351127069169418260/image.png?ex=67d9e764&is=67d895e4&hm=12bbe1810790f7f688b11fe093f693a2791e94bd9e74e71ec7c2cfa3264bd004&).
- **System Prompt Reliability Questioned**: A member suggested that while system prompts should work, relying on specific behaviors might not be robust, because *all these at the end is text input, so the model can process it. You should be able to bypass the framework and service.*
   - They added that the training data looks like `<system> You are a helpful assistant </system> <user> {{Some example user prompt}} </user> <assistant> {{Expected LLM output}} </assistant>` and that frameworks may not reliably pass system prompts to all LLMs.
