<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Busy day with more upgrades coming to AINews Reddit.**

> AI News for 7/10/2024-7/11/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**463** channels, and **2240** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **280 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Three picks for today:

**[FlashAttention-3: Fast and Accurate Attention with Asynchrony and Low-precision](https://www.together.ai/blog/flashattention-3)**:

While [FlashAttention2](https://www.latent.space/p/flashattention) was an immediate hit last year, it was only optimized for A100 GPUs. The H100 update is here:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/06860531-4666-4ad7-ae4e-74910fdeded6.png?w=960&fit=max) 

There's lots of fancy algorithm work that is above our paygrades, but it is notable how they are preparing the industry to move toward native FP8 training:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/d4d847cb-3efb-4357-851b-5f4652ef70f3.png?w=960&fit=max) 

**[PaliGemma: A versatile 3B VLM for transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07726)**:

[Announced at I/O](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-google-io-in-60-seconds/), PaliGemma is a 3B open Vision-Language Model (VLM) that is based on a shape optimized SigLIP-So400m ViT encoder and the Gemma-2B language model, and the paper is out now. [Lucas](https://x.com/giffmana/status/1811146264832037303) tried his best to make it an informative paper.

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/fefd64f1-db3d-4d24-8ad4-7a4e714ec01a.png?w=960&fit=max) 

They are really stressing [the Prefix-LM nature of it](https://x.com/giffmana/status/1811146269605384298?s=46): "Full attention between image and prefix (=user input), auto-regressive only on suffix (=model output). The intuition is that this way, the image tokens can see the query and do task-dependent "thinking"; if it was full AR, they couldn't."

**[OpenAI Levels of Superintelligence](https://archive.is/SLtFQ):

We typically ignore AGI debates but when OpenAI has a framework they are communicating at all-hands, it's relevant. [Bloomberg got the leak](https://x.com/shiringhaffary/status/1811508824970264595?s=61):

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ea1b0447-547f-4b56-9133-1da3c2a68fd9.png?w=960&fit=max) 

It's notable that OpenAI thinks it is close to solving Level 2, and that Ilya left because he also thinks Superintelligence is within reach, but disagrees on the safety element.

- **Modular Model Spec Launched**: The **Modular Model Spec** [version 0.0.0](https://modular-model-spec.vercel.app) aims to increase the reliability, developer convenience, and flexibility of LLMs by outlining a **unified, modular dataset format**.
   - _Why This Spec Matters_: Higher reliability, programmable settings, and improved flexibility for **LLM-augmented applications**.
- **Training New Tokens via Examples**: Given that new tokens won't appear in pretraining data, a member suggests training on them directly with numerous post-training examples.
   - "These tokens won’t appear in any pretraining data, so training directly on them is the only option," they argued.
- **Implementing Partially Trainable Config in PyTorch**: A customized **PartiallyTrainableConfig** class and corresponding embedding and LMHead classes in PyTorch allow specific tokens to be trainable while freezing others.
   - This approach modifies the model to only train embeddings and logits for the target tokens, but faces issues with **requires_grad** on specific weight matrix ranges.
- **Gemma-2-27b Excels at Fine-tuning**: Gemma-2-27b model stands out for coding tasks, reportedly being able to code Tetris in Python with only two shots.
   - It joins Codestral and Deepseek-v2 on this front, outperforming other open-source models like **llama-3-70b** and **qwen2-72b**.

- **Quantization and Sparsity Strategies**: Exploring the combination of quantization and sparsity, it is proposed that higher bitwidth be reserved for non-sparse elements, improving quality without consuming more storage or computation.
   - **50% semi-structured sparsity** has minimal quality loss and provides a computational advantage.
- **Achieving Speed-ups with Quantized Sparse Matrices**: A fused gemv CUDA kernel demonstrated nearly 4x speed-ups when using a specific format: 1:2 sparsity with 7-bit non-sparse elements.
   - Speed-ups were shown by **packing sparse matrices** efficiently, achieving **3.7337x to 3.3228x** increases in speed for various matrix shapes.
- **SparseGPT Pruning for Large Models**: SparseGPT enables pruning large GPT-family models to **50% sparsity** without retraining while maintaining accuracy.
   - SparseGPT can execute on prominent open-source models like **OPT-175B** and **BLOOM-176B** within 4.5 hours, achieving up to **60% unstructured sparsity** with negligible increase in perplexity.
- **WANDA Pruning Approach**: The **WANDA** method offers a simple and effective LLM pruning technique compatible with weight quantization approaches.
   - [GitHub link: WANDA](https://github.com/locuslab/wanda) provides more details on its implementation and effectiveness.
- **Further Experiments with Distillation**: Future plans include running **distillation** with the sparsified model to assess performance and accuracy improvements.
   - By modifying packing strategies, further speed-ups and efficiency could be realized, potentially **6x-7x** faster with 1:4 sparsity and **6-bit quantization**.

- **Debate on demographic information and pornography use**: A user asked if there's a correlation between demographic information about conservatives and liberals and their use of pornography, suggesting conservatives might use more due to cultural repression.
   - There is no clear consensus on whether conservatives use more pornography than liberals, although some studies hint that this might be the case.
- **Steps to prevent spam phone calls**: To prevent spam phone calls, users were advised to register on national 'Do Not Call' lists like the **National DNCL** in Canada and the **FTC's Do Not Call Registry** in the U.S.
   - Enabling features like 'Silence Unknown Callers' in iOS was also recommended to mitigate spam calls effectively.
- **Creators and YouTube video downvotes**: Before YouTube made changes, creators could see the total number of likes and dislikes in YouTube Studio, but couldn't identify who specifically disliked their videos.
   - Changes to this feature have been implemented, but the exact details of when these modifications occurred were not specified.
- **Setting dependencies in Docker Compose**: The `depends_on` directive in Docker Compose only works with services defined within the same Compose file but not for containers across different Compose files.
   - To handle dependencies between separate Compose files, options like using external networks with health checks or implementing a wait script were suggested.

> - `NuMojo compatibility with nightly`
> - `Mojo open-source timeline`
> - `Kernel bypass networking in Mojo`
> - `Dynamic operands in mlir_ops` 


- **Setitem syntax issue with Mojo**: A member encountered an error using `A[0] = 1` in Mojo, which does not occur with `A.__setitem__(0, 1)`. The problem seems related to the type checks between `__getitem__` and `__setitem__`, leading them to raise [issue #3212](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/3212).
- **NuMojo compatibility issues with Mojo nightly**: Updating to the latest Mojo nightly caused incompatibility issues with NuMojo, especially with DTypePointer API changes. The nightly still shows the same error with a simplified example, despite recent updates.
- **Mojo will eventually open-source**: Chris Lattner reassured users that Mojo will open-source in the future, comparing it to LLVM and Swift which took years to be open-sourced. He cited the temporary closed stage as a way to refine the project without the burden of early wide-scale contributions.
- **Focus on kernel bypass networking in Mojo**: Darkmatter__ expressed hope that Mojo avoids mistakes other languages made with kernel bypass networking. Ensuring clean integration of networking components seems to be a significant concern for users.
- **Dynamic operands in mlir_ops**: A question was raised about using dynamic operands in mlir operations, particularly for index addition. The query looks for a method to dynamically pass attributes to mlir operations.
