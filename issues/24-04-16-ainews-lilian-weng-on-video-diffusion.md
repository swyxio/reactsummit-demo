<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 4/15/2024-4/16/2024. We checked 5 subreddits and [**364** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **27** Discords (**395** channels, and **5610** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **615 minutes**.

One thing we missed covering in the weekend rush is Lilian Weng's blog on [Diffusion Models for Video Generation](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-04-12-diffusion-video/). While her work is rarely breaking news on any particular day, it is almost always the single most worthwhile resource on a given important AI topic, and we would say this even if she did *not* happen to work at OpenAI.

Anyone keen on Sora, the biggest AI launch of the year so far (now rumored to be [coming to Adobe Premiere Pro](https://twitter.com/legit_rumors/status/1779951008539345140)), should read this. Unfortunately for most of us, the average diffusion paper requires 150+ IQ to read.

We are only half joking. As per Lilian's style, she takes us on a wild tour of all the SOTA videogen techniques of the past 2 years, humbling every other AI summarizooor on earth:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/741bfc10-624e-4a05-b3ab-cb1b45d083d7.png?w=960&fit=max) 

The surprise find of the day comes from her highlight of **Training-free adaptation**, which is exactly as wild as it sounds: 

> "Somehow surprisingly, it is possible to adapt a pre-trained text-to-image model to output videos without any training 🤯."

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ca8e24fc-ffe2-4a93-b6e1-cac34b0ef23f.png?w=960&fit=max) 


She unfortunately only spends 2 sentences discussing Sora, and she definitely knows more she can't say. Anyway, this is likely the most authoritative explanation to How SOTA AI Video Actually Works you or I are ever likely to get unless Bill Peebles takes to paper writing again.

- **Unsloth Assists Data-Driven Chatbot Upgrade**: A member discusses formatting personal chat messages for training an AI clone of themselves via Unsloth and gets assistance including a Python script for converting the dataset into [ShareGPT format](https://github.com/mhagiwara/sharegpt#data-format), and advice on using this script with their personal data to create a training-ready dataset. They were also directed to a related [Unsloth notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Aau3lgPzeZKQ-98h69CCu1UJcvIBLmy2?usp=sharing).
- **LoRA Tweaking for Enhanced Training**: Users report varying the alpha parameter during fine-tuning a model using LoRA. For rslora, it's suggested that alpha be double the rank value, though the exact optimal value may vary by case.
- **ORPO Support with Unsloth**: According to a member, ORPO, which optimizes the resources required for model training, is already supported within Unsloth. The ORPO method differs from DPO by not requiring a separate SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) step beforehand.
- **CUDA Learning and Triton's Promise**: A participant new to CUDA gets advice to lean on [Triton tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyKBN1rnefI&list=PLSXcJOyFhmS-qb_CF-GLhkWxSmi-ftbPO&index=2) for learning and advised that Unsloth does not recommend native CUDA, instead suggesting Triton as more beneficial for LLM work.
- **Unsloth and Gemma**: For best results, don't use packing with Gemma models. The Unsloth library is compatible with packing for Llama and Mistral, and configurations with high-rank adapters may exhibit unexpected loss jump issues during training.

- **Kapa.AI Brings Instant Answers to Discord Communities**: [Kapa.AI](https://www.kapa.ai/) offers customizable AI bots that provide instant technical support in communities such as Slack and Discord. Their bots can be added to servers to improve developer experience by providing immediate answers and eliminating wait times, which is elaborated on their [community engagement use-case page](https://www.kapa.ai/use-cases/community-engagement) and their [Discord installation documentation](https://docs.kapa.ai/installation-discord).

- **Exploring Compilation Optimization with Mojo Language**: A discussion on using aliases for compile-time parameter decisions in Mojo language revealed that using such methods can lead to memory optimizations as unused aliases don't reserve memory space after compilation. For more nuanced opinions on code clarity versus comments, a [YouTube video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf7vDBBOBUA) on the subject was shared.

- **Understanding Typestates and Memory Efficiency**: Conversing about the benefits of typestates over aliases, a member recommended a technique from Rust for making compile-time guarantees about object state, as described in an article about [Rust typestates](https://cliffle.com/blog/rust-typestate/). The discussion evolved around memory use optimizations in language design, specifically how boolean values are stored and addressed in memory.

- **Bit-Level Optimizations in Programming Languages Explored**: The chat shed light on why language specifications, like those in C, define enums as 32-bit integers and debated whether bools need to use a full byte. These topics touched on processor-level memory allocation and the potential efficiencies in memory usage at the language-level, referencing how boolean values could be represented more compactly as bits within a byte.

- **Rust's BitVec Crate Offers Both Speed and Memory Efficiency**: The discussion concluded by endorsing Rust's BitVec crate for being both speed and memory efficient when handling sets of boolean flags. An example cited was an optimization case which improved performance, going from taking years to just minutes, by using a bitset in Rust, as detailed on [willcrichton.net](https://willcrichton.net/notes/k-corrset/).

- **Mojo Adaptation of Python Tools**: A new [Python package called mojo2py](https://github.com/venvis/mojo2py) has been developed to convert Mojo code to Python code, indicating a growing interest in tools that bridge the gap between Python and Mojo. The repository is available on GitHub.
- **Learning Mojo Essentials**: For those looking to learn Mojo from scratch, the [Mojo Programming Manual](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/) is the go-to comprehensive guide, with emphasis on core concepts such as parameters versus arguments and understanding traits.
- **Introducing Conditional Conformance**: There is an ongoing discussion about the potential for *conditional conformance* in Mojo, allowing for behaviors like structural patterns found in other languages such as C++ or Haskell, though there may be challenges when it comes to generic code.
- **Variant Type for Runtime Flexibility**: The usage of `Variant` as a way to create a list containing multiple types akin to Python is validated, with the point made that `Variant` acts more like a tagged union at runtime, akin to ADTs in TypeScript.
- **Efforts on Syntaxes and Representation**: Multiple members are actively discussing possible improvements to Mojo's syntax for function signatures and type representation, including the use of `'1` numerals to avoid verbose naming in partially-bound types, and Treesitter grammar/LSP development for broader integrations beyond VS Code.

- **VRAM vs. RAM for Running Models**: A member questioned if models could run on a system with 24 GB VRAM and 96 GB RAM, and there's concern that inference might be *incredibly slow*. Another found success with an M3 MacBook Pro 128GB, running models at speeds comparable to GPT-4 using LMStudio and MLX, achieving up to 10 tokens/sec.

- **Performance of Command R Plus and WizardLM-2-8x22B**: A user reported they will test **WizardLM-2-8x22B** and share results. Another user was *not impressed* with **Mixtral 8x22b** and pondered whether its base model status affected performance.

- **Understanding Base Models**: Users discussed what constitutes a "Base" model, clarifying that it's one that hasn't been fine-tuned for specific tasks like chat or instruct. There was a mention that any base model could potentially be prompted to perform various tasks.

- **Model Comparison and Fine-Tuning Considerations**: A member reported getting over 10 tokens/sec on both **MaziyarPanahi/WizardLM-2-8x22B.Q4_K_M** and **Command R Plus**, with both prompting the model to write a simple Rust application successfully. Discussions also covered whether models continuously learn from chat and the concept of "forgetting" certain knowledge areas during fine-tuning.

- **Potential Implicit Bias in AI Models**: It was suggested that AI models might be biased towards math, IT, AI, and computer vision, reflecting the interests of the developers and a majority of users. Queries were raised on whether models are always learning from interactions and the simplicity of fine-tuning models to *forget* unwanted knowledge domains.

- **Full Graph Compilation Issues Resolved**: After discussion, it was noted that using `torch.nn.functional.linear` and disabling CUDA graph with `enable_cuda_graph=False` can mitigate compilation issues faced with `torch.compile` set to `full_graph=True`. The token generation speed varies with and without full graph compilation but [**stable-fast**](https://github.com/chengzeyi/stable-fast/blob/main/src/sfast/jit/passes/__init__.py) could serve as an effective substitute in case of failures.

- **Stable-fast's Utility Beyond Stable Diffusion**: The use of **stable-fast** for optimizing inference proved to be beneficial, running close to INT8 quant *TensorRT speeds*. It was recommended for wider use beyond just Stable Diffusion models due to performance gains.

- **Exploring Fused Operations**: A suggestion was made to extend stable-fast with more types of fused operations, highlighting the library's potential versatility.

- **CUDA Graphs Not Always Helpful**: It was pointed out that CUDA graphs don't necessarily aid performance due to the overhead of recreating graphs for dynamic context lengths typical in autoregressive generation models.

- **GitHub Resource for Faster Matrix Operations**: A new **fp16 accumulation** vector-matrix multiplication that rivals **torch gemv** was added to [torch-cublas-hgemm](https://github.com/aredden/torch-cublas-hgemm/blob/master/src/simt_hgemv.cu), potentially offering a substantial boost in efficiency for specific matrix sizes.

- **Exploring the Limits of Language Models in Video Generation**: [Diffusion models for video generation](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-04-12-diffusion-video/) pose a more challenging problem than image synthesis due to the need for temporal consistency and difficulty in collecting high-quality video data. Pre-read material on **Diffusion Models** for image generation is recommended for better understanding.
  
- **Examining Tokenization's Role in Language Models**: Research [paper from Berkeley](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08335) shows the significance of tokenization in language modeling. Without tokenization, transformers default to unigram models, but tokenization permits near-optimal modeling of sequence probabilities.

- **LLMs as Data Compressors**: A study ([arXiv:2404.09937](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09937)) finds that perplexity is highly correlated with downstream performance when evaluating language models. This supports the idea that model compression capabilities may facilitate artificial intelligence development.

- **Challenges in Scaling Transformers to Unlimited Context Length**: The introduction of Megalodon and Feedback Attention Memory (FAM) ([arXiv:2404.08801](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08801) and [arXiv:2404.09173](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09173)) demonstrates attempts to improve transformer efficiency for handling long sequences.

- **Debate on Depth vs. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Models Efficacy**: Discussions centered around whether dense models or MoE models are superior, with considerations of VRAM constraints and inference cost. No clear consensus was reached, but various angles on advantages and constraints for each model type were debated.

- **Idefics2 8B Outperforming its Predecessor**: The **Idefics2** model is now available on Hugging Face and enhances capabilities in OCR, document understanding, and visual reasoning, outperforming **Idefics1** with fewer parameters and improved image handling. Access the model at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics2-8b).

- **RTX 5090 Launch Anticipation**: Discussions suggest that Nvidia might release the **RTX 5090** graphics card sooner than expected, potentially at the Computex trade show in June, due to competitive pressure, as reported on [PCGamesN](https://www.pcgamesn.com/nvidia/rtx-5090-5080-paper-launch).

- **Mixtral 8x22B Inference Possibilities Explored**: Members shared experiences with **Mixtral 8x22B**, noting that using 3 A6000 with FSDP for QLoRA during training, and theorizing that two A6000 could be sufficient for inference with up to 4k context length using 4-bit quantization.

- **Model Stock Method as Forgetting Mitigator**: A comparison of different training methods on **Cosmopedia-subset data** indicates that **Model Stock merge** of various tuning methods is effective at repairing catastrophic forgetting. It was suggested that combined fine-tuning methods like Model Stock, QLoRA, GaLore, and LISA might reduce adaptation intensity, potentially needing louder LoRAs to compensate.

- **Gradient Accumulation Under Scrutiny**: A member questioned the efficacy of **gradient accumulation** when using sample packing, as they observed that training time and dataset length change with varying gradient accumulation steps. The member was seeking clarity on whether gradient accumulation indeed conserves memory as expected.

- **Deciphering Input's Role in Training**: One member inquired about the purpose of the input if `train_on_input` is disabled, speculating whether it's still used to teach the model context handling and prediction. Another member responded, suggesting that the input becomes a bigger part of the context, and the model will remember or steer towards it more.

- **Clarifying Loss Calculation with `train_on_input`**: In a follow-up, it was clarified that when `train_on_input` is enabled, the **loss is not calculated** with respect to the input, which subsequently influences the model training differently as it's not predicting the input part anymore.

- **Understanding Impact of Loss on Training**: The conversation continued with a discussion about the role of loss in training when `train_on_input` is on, leading to a confirmation that loss does not influence training in this scenario. It was also mentioned that without evaluation enabled, loss becomes even less relevant.

- **Axolotl's Epoch Dilemma**: A member sought advice on how to configure Axolotl to prevent saving the model after every epoch and instead save only upon completion of training. The recommendation involves setting the `save_strategy` to `"no"` in the training arguments or `config.yml`, and then manually setting up a save operation after training ends.
- **TinyLlama for Tight Spaces**: For fine-tuning with a smaller-than-7B model, the "TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0" was suggested for fast iteration and experimentation. This model's configuration can be found in the `pretrain.yml` within the `examples/tiny-llama` directory in the Axolotl repository.

**Datasette - LLM (@SimonW) ▷ #[llm](https://discord.com/channels/823971286308356157/1128504153841336370/1229617445115789353)** (22 messages🔥): 

- **Creating a Simplified LLM Web UI**: A member has created a simple web UI for browsing LLM log data, offering more intuitive interaction than Datasette for viewing logs and the goal of easier revisiting of past chats. The prototype was made with Streamlit, and the initial version is for log browsing only, as the APIs appear to lack easy retrieval of past conversations.

- **Prototype Showcase and Discussion**: The Streamlit-built UI prototype was shared in the chat, and another member expressed interest in knowing how it was built. The conversation expanded to discuss possibilities of integrating it as a Datasette plugin or as a standalone installable script.

- **Implementation and Tool Choice**: The creator described their experience as positive with Streamlit, a first-time use, though they initially considered building it as a plugin for either Datasette or LLM.

- **Future Development and Sharing**: While the current iteration is focused solely on browsing, it was mentioned that the app is around 200 lines and thus easy to work with. A GitHub gist link to the code was provided: [Initial LLM WebUI Gist](https://gist.github.com/RyanBalfanz/cd08b7402594fa91831bf8d54c76e0ec).
