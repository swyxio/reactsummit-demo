<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Contextual Batching is all you need.**

> AI News for 10/3/2024-10/4/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **31** Discords (**226** channels, and **1896** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **210 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

We often give the top story on AINews to movements of the big model labs, and today Meta's new text to video model, [Movie Gen](https://x.com/ahmad_al_dahle/status/1842188269557301607?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug), is sweeping the news, with [a paper](https://x.com/sytelus/status/1841960777588379656) that notably claims that they were able to adapt Llama 3 to video generation much better than OpenAI Sora's Diffusion Transformers. However, there is no actual release, just cherrypicked marketing videos, and we try to focus on news you can use here.

So we are happy to highlight Jack Morris and Sasha Rush's new paper and `cde-small-v1` model on [Contextual Document Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02525), "**the best BERT-sized text embedding model in the world**".

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b1a9ffd9-ed18-4159-9925-22029f37649e.png?w=960&fit=max)

Jack puts it best:

> "Typical text embedding models have two main problems:
> 
> 1. training them is complicated and requires many tricks: giant batches, distillation, hard negatives...
> 2. the embeddings don't "know" what corpus they will be used in; consequently, all text spans are encoded the same way"
>
> To fix (1) we develop a new training technique: contextual batching. all batches share a lot of context – one batch might be about horse races in Kentucky, the next batch about differential equations, etc.
>
> 
> And for (2), we propose a new **contextual embedding** architecture. this requires changes to both the training and evaluation pipeline to incorporate **contextual tokens** – essentially, model sees extra text from the surrounding context, and can update the embedding accordingly

This seems to make sense - priming the embeddings model to adapt to context tokens first before doing proper embeddings.

While most [leaderboard-topping](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) embeddings models are >7B in size (scoring ~72 on MTEB), the 143M parameter `cde-small-v1` scores a respectable 65 while sitting comfortably between models 50x larger. A nice efficiency win.

> - `VinePPO`
> - `Flex Attention`
> - `Batch Size Optimization`
> - `Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)` 


- **VinePPO revolutionizes RL for LLM Reasoning**: A member highlighted that **VinePPO**, a modification to PPO, shows significant improvements over RL-free methods and standard PPO, achieving results with up to **9x fewer steps**, **3x less time**, and **half the memory**.
   - This prompts a rethink of **RL post-training**, as noted in the discussion thread.
- **Flex Attention achieves improved runtime performance**: A member discussed that **Flex Attention** should maintain similar runtime when processing batches of concatenated samples due to the **block sparsity** of the attention mask.
   - Another member confirmed that testing shows **bsz=1** with **1000 tokens** performs equally in time and memory as **bsz=2** with **500 tokens** each.
- **Exploration of batch size in packed runs**: A member suggested potentially removing the batch size option when utilizing packed setups to streamline processing, advocating for either batch size or **tokens_per_pack** for a consistent **bs=1**.
   - This raises questions about efficiency and the impact on performance metrics.
- **Discussion on implementing DDP**: There is speculation about incorporating **Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)**, where each sampler is set to **bsz=1**, optimizing for single device usage.
   - This approach could enhance resource allocation and performance across devices.
