- **Differentiable Cache Augmentation improves LLM thinking**: Research shows that augmenting a frozen LLM with an offline coprocessor operating on its key-value (kv) cache enhances its ability to generate and attend to intermediate reasoning steps, thus reducing latency costs.
   - Experiments revealed that when the cache is augmented, the decoder achieves **lower perplexity** and better performance across various reasoning-intensive tasks, even without task-specific training.
- **Explore DeepSeek-V3 on GitHub**: The project **DeepSeek-V3** is actively developed and can be explored on GitHub, as detailed in the [DeepSeek_V3.pdf](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3.pdf).
   - This PDF offers insights into the project's development and capabilities, enhancing community participation and contributions.

> `Differentiable Cache Augmentation, DeepSeek V3` 


- **Enhancing LLMs with Differentiable Cache**: Research demonstrates a method for augmenting a frozen LLM with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's **key-value (kv) cache** to reduce latency and improve performance on reasoning tasks.
   - *Augmenting the cache consistently reduces perplexity* on various tasks, as the coprocessor can operate asynchronously and the language model remains functional if it's unavailable.
- **DeepSeek V3 Now Available**: The latest version of DeepSeek, known as **DeepSeek-V3**, has been made available on GitHub, offering significant advancements in development.
   - You can find more details and contribute on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3.pdf).

> `DeepSeek V3 Launch, Multi-Token Prediction, Reward Model Techniques, Performance Comparisons, Model Training Techniques` 


- **DeepSeek V3 Launch heralds major advancements**: DeepSeek V3 has been introduced, boasting **60 tokens/second**, which is **3x faster than its predecessor** V2, with existing API compatibility and enhanced capabilities.
   - The model is fully open-source and has been trained on **14.8 trillion tokens**, showcasing significant engineering prowess under resource constraints.
- **Innovative Multi-Token Prediction method revealed**: DeepSeek utilized a novel **Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)** technique, which concatenates final representations with initial embeddings while maintaining a causal chain throughout predictions.
   - This approach diverges from previous methods, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of the model without the complexities of multiple independent decoding heads.
- **New Reward Model Techniques for Training**: DeepSeek employs two types of RL rewards: **verifiers for code/mathematics** and a model-based RM method trained in a chain of thought style, which aids in refining outputs.
   - The implementation is reported to enhance model performance strategically, but questions remain regarding the critique mechanism for non-definitive outputs like creative writing.
- **Speculations and Comparisons with Existing Models**: Several members expressed excitement about DeepSeek V3’s performance, noting it **outperforms many open-source models** and is comparable to models like **GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet-3.5**.
   - Discussion around the **cost-effective scaling** of resources used for training highlighted the efficient use of GPU hours compared to earlier iterations.
- **Critique and Revision Debate**: Members speculated on the effectiveness of using critique versus generating multiple outputs to select the best response, pondering the implications of computational efficiency.
   - Questions arose regarding the integration of exogenous information in prompts, suggesting that clarity on the role of self-critique could lead to more effective model training results.
