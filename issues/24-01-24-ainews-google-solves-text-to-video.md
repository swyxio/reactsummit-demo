## Lumiere - text to video

Enter [Lumiere from Google Research](https://lumiere-video.github.io/). Every part of this video is computer generated:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxLr02Dz2Sc

In particular I would draw your attention to [their inpainting capabilities](https://lumiere-video.github.io/#w-node-_3f4320ee-e950-98f9-f142-c6b14cdf4fd4-47edbc52) - watch the syrup pour on the cake and *stay there*:

This is a step above anything we've yet seen coming out of Pika and Runway. This seems to come from a Space-Time diffusion process:

- **Inference Tricks for Mistral and Llama**: User `@blackl1ght` questioned about alternative inference methods for `mistral` over `llama.cpp`, and `@.ben.com` recommended `exllamav2`. In connection, `@blackl1ght` reported an issue with the `EOS` token being included in streaming responses, which `@max_paperclips` confirmed happens sporadically, depending on the model.

- **OOM Issues and Sequence Length in Fine-tuning LLMs**: User `@besiktas` described an out-of-memory (OOM) issue encountered when fine-tuning, even when previous forward/backward passes were successful. `@yonta0098` recommended checking if longer sequences are causing the issues and maybe sorting the data by decreasing length to trigger OOM early if that's the case.

- **Discussions on LLM Evaluation and Fine-tuning**: `@rememberlenny` initiated a discussion on code-related evaluations for LLMs, and various users, including `@manveerxyz` and `@besiktas`, mentioned benchmarks such as `HumanEval`, `MBPP`, and `DeepSeek`. `@besiktas` also raised concerns about the quality of some parts of the Hugging Face code and mentioned PRs that haven't been addressed.

- **Fine-tuning Challenges and Hugging Face Problems**: `@besiktas` provided a link to a test implementation to diagnose fine-tuning memory leaks by gradually increasing the context length and described difficulties with the Hugging Face `FuyuProcessor`. This sparked a discussion about the challenges of contributing to such large-scale collaborative projects.

- **Summarization Shenanigans with Mixtral 8x7b**: User `@atom202300` reported issues with **Mixtral 8x7b** and the **Huggingface Text Generation Interface (TGI)** wherein the model would unpredictably cut off responses during summarization tasks. Despite a stable VRAM, the problem persisted for specific examples, suggesting sensitivity to prompt structure.
- **Prompt Patterns Prompt Problems**: `@sublimatorniq` and `@atom202300` discussed the effect of altering prompt syntax on summarization performance, finding that changing from square brackets to parentheses reduced premature stopping, while `@mrdragonfox` mentioned that **Mixtral** requires careful increment adjustments to prevent spamming.
- **Troubleshooting Model Stops with Seeds**: `@sublimatorniq` theorized that the use of different seeds could induce variable stopping behaviors—with one seed causing early stops and another leading to extended responses.
- **Open-Weights and Finetuning Frustrations**: `@wayne_deng` inquired about the availability of source code and finetuning possibilities for the **Mixtral** model. `@mrdragonfox` stated that many have attempted finetuning without success due to high costs and the model's complexity.
- **Mistral API JSON Response Request**: User `@madmax____` sought help with forcing the Mistral API to return responses in **JSON format**, but found the `response_format` parameter ineffective. `@akshay_1` shared a link, possibly as a solution to the issue but the context of the link was not provided.

- **Local Model Use in vLLM**: `@shihard_85648` asked for a way to use a local model file with vLLM, having downloaded the "raw" Mistral file, and `@mrdragonfox` advised to use the `--model` flag followed by the full local path. This bypasses the need to download the model from HuggingFace, which is the usual process as explained by `@vhariational`.
- **vLLM Docker Image Clarification**: `@vhariational` referenced the vLLM documentation, indicating that the Huggingface cache directory is bind-mounted at runtime, meaning you wouldn't need to redownload the model when rebuilding the Docker image.
- **Model Path Configuration Instructions**: `@mrdragonfox` provided a detailed link to the vLLM documentation, elaborating on the engine arguments including how to specify paths for both model and tokenizer.
- **Efficient Mistral MoE Setup Inquiries**: User `@yoann_b` inquired about an economical setup for running Mistral MoE at 12token/s on hardware less than $3,000, leading to `@mrdragonfox` suggesting a 32GB M1 Mac or using two 3090 GPUs for higher performance.
- **Technical Specs and Performance Metrics**: In the discussions about configurations, `@mrdragonfox` mentioned running mistral 8x7b on an `A6000` (a 48GB VRAM GPU) with '6bpw' (bits per weight), achieving about 60 tokens/second with `exllamav2`.

- **Getting the Hang of It**: `@not_lain` mentioned that although a task may be challenging at first, it becomes easier with practice, implying a learning curve in their recent endeavors.

- **Privacy-Conscious Transcription Tool Development**: `@n278jm` is building a tool that transcribes and summarizes **audio recordings of consultations**. The objective is to operate entirely locally to maintain the **privacy** of the data due to the sensitive nature of the consultations.

- **Tool Specifications Unveiled**: `@n278jm` detailed the tool's workflow: "Meeting audio upload as input -> transcription with speaker diarization -> meeting summary as output". They plan to use **Hugging Face's transformers** for the audio transcription, **pyannote.audio 3.1** for speaker diarization, and a DistilBERT model for summarization, all tied together with a simple HTML front end.

- **Python as a Blast from the Past**: `@n278jm` expressed some challenges with the Python language due to a long absence from using it, particularly when parsing lists and dictionaries to integrate diarization data with transcription results.

- **Considering Protobuf for Pipeline Communications**: `@n278jm` is contemplating writing **protobuf definitions** to bridge pipelines and possibly use Go for processing the results of the transformers. This suggests they're considering alternatives to Python for parts of their project workflow.
