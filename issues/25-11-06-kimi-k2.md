- **Kimi K2 Thinking Goes Agentic, Breaks SOTA**: **Moonshot AI** launched **Kimi K2 Thinking** with a **256K context window** and autonomous **200–300 tool calls**, claiming SOTA on **HLE (44.9%)** and **BrowseComp (60.2%)**; see the technical blog [Kimi K2 Thinking](https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/thinking.html) and weights on [moonshotai at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai). The model targets reasoning, agentic search, and coding, and is live on [kimi.com](http://kimi.com/) with API at [platform.moonshot.ai](http://platform.moonshot.ai/).
    - [OpenRouter announced K2 Thinking](https://x.com/OpenRouterAI/status/1986463851802685881) and documented returning upstream reasoning via `reasoning_details` to preserve chains of thought across calls in [OpenRouter reasoning tokens docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#example-preserving-reasoning-blocks-with-openrouter-and-claude). The team highlights **test-time scaling** that interleaves thought and tools for stable, goal-directed reasoning over long sequences.
- **Users Crown K2 'GPT5 of Open Models'**: Early testers praised **Kimi K2 Thinking** for multi-hop web search and deep browsing without explicit prompting, sharing results in [this analysis thread](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1986541785511043536). Reports emphasize strong **reasoning** and **tool-use** behaviors that feel closer to heavyweight closed models in practical tasks.
    - One user called it *"like GPT5 of open models"*, lauding cost efficiency and autonomy for building agentic systems. Community sentiment favors K2 for search-heavy tasks and long-form workflows where **coherence across tool calls** matters.
- **OpenRouter or Direct? Choose Your K2 Lane**: Builders debated accessing **K2** via a direct **Moonshot API/subscription** versus a unified marketplace through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). For K2-only workflows, a direct API was favored; multi-model shops preferred OpenRouter’s consolidated access despite premium fees.
    - Several suggested trialing the lowest subscription tier (e.g., **$19**/mo) before scaling usage, while power users highlighted OpenRouter’s support for preserving **reasoning content** across calls via documented patterns. For VS Code integrations, direct API offers tighter control, but OpenRouter simplifies model switching during evaluation.
- **INT4 Benchmarks Hint at Headroom**: Benchmarks for **Kimi K2** ran in **INT4 precision** (weights-level), which reduces compute and memory bandwidth but can impact ultimate scores. Community notes clarified INT4 indicates quantized weight precision, not a degradation of the base model design.
    - Users expect higher scores under optimal conditions (e.g., higher-precision evaluation or better serving stacks), with one tester saying they’ve been *"perma-bullish on Moonshot since the July 11 release"*. The most visible win was K2’s conversational **reasoning naturalness** without drifting into word salad.

**2. Benchmarks, Leaderboards, and 'Who’s Winning' Meta**

- **CodeClash Stages Code Wars, Humans Still Win**: John Yang unveiled **CodeClash**, a goal-oriented coding tournament benchmark where LLMs maintain separate repos across arenas like BattleSnake and RoboCode; see [CodeClash results snapshot](https://xcancel.com/jyangballin/status/1986093902122942700?s=46). Across **1,680 tournaments (25,200 rounds)**, LLMs trailed human experts badly (aggregate losses reported as **0–37,500**), with **Claude Sonnet 4.5** leading among models.
    - The benchmark stresses **VCS-agnostic** coding and iterative improvement rather than one-shot code dumps, surfacing strategic gaps in current agents. Community reactions ranged from excitement over the tournament format to calls for richer tool-use and environment feedback loops.
- **Polaris Alpha Rockets to Repo Bench Top 3**: A stealth model dubbed **Polaris Alpha** leapt to **#3** on Repo Bench, triggering speculation it could be [OpenAI’s GPT‑5.1 or a new Gemini](https://xcancel.com/pvncher/status/1986528872444067850). The jump happened quickly, spurring leaderboard sleuthing and side-by-side diffs.
    - Some users noted **Claude 4.1** outperforming **Claude 4.5** on certain Repo Bench slices, hinting at test variance and niche strengths. The episode fueled renewed debates on **benchmark representativeness** and the durability of quick leaderboard surges.
- **GPT‑5 Voxels Past Gemini 3 Pro on VoxelBench**: Screenshots showed **GPT‑5** beating **Lithiumflow (Gemini 3 Pro)** on **VoxelBench**, a test for generating 3D models from voxel arrays; see the shared [VoxelBench result image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1340554757827461211/1436079363153199215/image.png). The discussion focused on 3D structure synthesis reliability and the coding chops needed to wire generation pipelines end-to-end.
    - Members argued **GPT‑5 Pro** might now out-code Gemini variants for these tasks and debated **cost-performance tradeoffs** for production use. The thread called for standardized voxel-to-mesh conversion checks and unit-tested post-processing.
- **fastWorkflow Snags Tau Bench SOTA**: **fastWorkflow** reported **SOTA** on retail and airline workflows using [fastWorkflow](https://github.com/radiantlogicinc/fastworkflow) with a [Tau Bench fork + adapter](https://github.com/drawal1/tau-bench), with a [paper forthcoming](https://arxiv.org/). The authors argue strong **context engineering** lets smaller models match or beat larger ones in realistic workflows.
    - They claimed *"with proper context engineering, small models can match/beat the big ones"*, emphasizing schema discipline and error‑aware routing. The result rekindled the **agentic workflow vs. raw model scale** debate in enterprise settings.
- **Vectorsum v2 Entry 67399 Sweeps GPUs**: Submission **67399** topped **A100** at **138 µs**, placed **3rd on B200** at **53.4 µs**, **2nd on H100** at **86.1 µs**, and **5th on L4** at **974 µs** in `vectorsum_v2`. Cross‑GPU strength suggests careful tuning of memory hierarchy and thread/block geometry.
    - The entry’s broad success spotlights portable optimizations over single‑arch heroics. It also sets a useful bar for entrants balancing **latency**, **occupancy**, and **bandwidth** without overfitting to one SM generation.

**3. GPU Systems: FP4 Tricks, Real Bandwidth, and Triton Tactics**

- **Blackwell Adds One‑Shot FP4→FP16 Conversions**: NVIDIA’s **Blackwell** PTX ISA adds block conversions from **FP4** to **FP16** via `cvt` with modes like `.e2m1x2`, `.e3m2x2`, `.e2m3x2`, `.ue8m0x2`; see the [PTX ISA v8.8 changes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-8-8). This enables mixed‑precision accumulation workflows where FP4 weights dequantize for compute and re‑quantize for output.
    - One member converted **PTX/CUDA docs** to Markdown trees so **Claude** can parse tables and embedded layout images more effectively. The thread traded notes on **quantization‑aware kernels** and where FP4 shines vs. where you should bail out to FP8/FP16.
- **Bandwidth Boasters Meet 92% Reality**: Experiments reproducing official **memory bandwidth** peaked at about **92%** of spec, exposing gaps between marketing and kernels in the wild. Suggested remedies included [locking the memory clock](https://link-to-locked-clock/) and grooming **coalesced** access patterns.
    - Engineers emphasized that alignment, stride, and L2 behaviors are often bigger wins than exotic intrinsics. The consensus: treat vendor TB/s as a horizon—optimize for your kernel’s **transaction patterns** to approach it.
- **Triton Re‑JITs to Fit Your N**: **Triton** recompiles kernels across iterations by specializing dynamic values like `n` (e.g., `tt.divisibility=16` showing in IR), explaining sudden codegen shifts. For AOT/interop, see this example to lower and call Triton kernels from C: [test_](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/main/python%2Ftest%2Funit%2Ftools%2Ftest_aot.py)[aot.py](http://aot.py/).
    - Developers discussed replicating Triton‑like JIT in **C++**, landing on a hack: generate **MLIR** in Python, inject into C++, and patch constants for block sizes. It’s clunky, but it unlocks **runtime shape specialization** in non‑Python stacks.
- **NCCL4Py Preview Brings Device‑API Goodies**: A preview of **nccl4py** landed for discussion in this PR: [NCCL Python bindings (preview)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/pull/1902). Teams compared **NCCL GIN + device APIs** with **NVSHMEM** for multi‑GPU collectives and fused ops.
    - While some favored **NVSHMEM** for certain patterns, others highlighted **NCCL’s** new device‑side control as a power boost for **end‑to‑end GPU scheduling**. A KernelBench fork is in the works to compare multi‑GPU kernels across frameworks.

**4. Research & Libraries: Linear Maps, Numerics, and New Video Diffusion**

- **Linear Maps Demystify LLM Inference**: A TMLR paper, [“Equivalent Linear Mappings of Large Language Models”](https://openreview.net/forum?id=oDWbJsIuEp), shows models like **Qwen 3 14B** and **Gemma 3 12B** admit equivalent linear representations of their inference operation. The authors compute a linear system from input to output embeddings, revealing low‑dimensional semantic structure via **SVD**.
    - Asked about **Tangent Model Composition**, the author clarified their focus is the **Jacobian in input embedding space** with exact reconstruction via Euler’s theorem, unlike Taylor approximations used in [Tangent Model Composition (ICCV 2023)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Liu_Tangent_Model_Composition_for_Ensembling_and_Continual_Fine-tuning_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf). The thread shared Jacobian resources for CNNs to build intuition.
- **Anthropic Postmortem Pins fp16 vs fp32 Sampling Bugs**: Engineers referenced Anthropic’s postmortem, [A postmortem of three recent issues](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/a-postmortem-of-three-recent-issues), which details **fp16 vs fp32** pitfalls in **top‑p/top‑k** sampling. The piece underscores how subtle numerics propagate into user‑visible generation errors.
    - Takeaway: validate **dtype** flows in inference graphs and add coverage for **precision‑sensitive paths**. Kernel and framework teams compared their unit tests for sampling correctness under precision swaps.
- **SANA‑Video Lands in Diffusers**: The **SANA‑Video** model merged into Hugging Face’s Diffusers via [PR #12584](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/12584). This adds another path for open **video generation** workflows, benefitting from Diffusers’ scheduler and pipeline ecosystem.
    - Developers highlighted the ease of plugging SANA‑Video into existing **inference stacks** and benchmarking against prior baselines. Expect rapid iteration on **samplers**, conditioning, and memory management as the community exercises new pipelines.

**5. Ecosystem Moves: Siri Rumors, Agent Cookouts, and Real‑Time Query Editing**

- **Apple Eyes Google’s 1.2T Model for New Siri**: A [Reuters report](https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-use-googles-ai-model-run-new-siri-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-11-05/) claimed **Apple** is considering a **1.2T‑parameter** **Google** model to overhaul **Siri**. The thread discussed priorities and whether such scale beats **on‑device + hybrid** approaches for latency and privacy.
    - Engineers asked what this implies for **tool‑use**, **speech**, and **personalization** layers vs. pure model size. Others flagged partner dependencies and evolving **compute economics** as bigger risks than model choice.
- **OpenAI Lets You Edit Prompts Mid‑Run**: **OpenAI** shipped real‑time query updates—interrupt a long run and add context without restarting; see the demo video [Real-time Query Adjustment](https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1986194201076506628/vid/avc1/3840x2160/rEuDomNqKSd8jEdW.mp4). This helps **GPT‑5 Pro** deep research loops where users refine hypotheses during tool calls.
    - Teams reported smoother **iterative refinement** for multi‑step queries and fewer wasted tokens. It dovetails with agent frameworks that checkpoint **state** and **reasoning chains** while swapping tools.
- **Tiger Data Hosts Coding Agent Cookout (NYC)**: The Tiger Data team announced an agent‑building meetup in **Brooklyn, NY** on **Nov 13, 6–9pm**; RSVP here: [Tiger Data Agent Cookout](https://luma.com/9oj7k21h?tk=3k7zIc). Attendees will build **coding agents** and trade notes with the engineering team.

- **Rust Interop Proc Macro Quandary**: Compiler plugins of a sort should be possible, but the Mojo team wants to address the **sandboxing concerns with Rust's proc macros** and having Mojo code call Rust proc macros is likely not going to happen.
   - You should be able to interop with the result of the macro expansion.
- **Origins are a Superset of Rust Lifetimes**: `Origin` is a **lifetime marker** that is a first-class member of the type system, allowing abstraction and creation of custom reference types with extra tricks to manage things like partial borrows.
   - Origins keep the backing memory alive rather than expressing how long it lives for, enabling Mojo to do *ASAP destruction*, which solves a lot of the issues Rust has with lock guards.
- **Hot Reloading Plans Postponed**: Hot reloading gets very messy in languages like Mojo, and the Mojo team is focusing on **compile fast enough** that you don't need hot reload.
   - Heavy parameterization means that hot-patching code is hard, and while one can define the GUI in a DSL and hot-reload the DSL with an interpreter, Mojo's interpreter is not particularly fast.

> `Introductions Channel, Post Length, AI Developer Study Notes` 


- **Debate Introductions Channel Concept**: A member suggested [making an introductions channel](https://discord.com/channels/729741769192767510/1102787157866852402) separate from general.
   - Another member stated that separate introductions would make the interaction staged, keeping them in general allows newcomers to enter the flow naturally, claiming *"I don't want an intro channel because then we'd just get a long self-promo feed that nobody reads. Want to contribute? Just go contribute.*"
- **Moderators Enforce Brevity for Newcomers**: A moderator requested a member to shorten their introduction post.
   - The moderator explained that *"This is not LinkedIn. It hasn't been edited. Not trying to be unwelcoming, but we get a ton of long intros from people who don't actually contribute anything. I want to keep discussions focused on research.*"
- **Discord Pinpointing Pin Problems**: A member mentioned the pin in <#1102787157866852402> is wrong.

> `Equivalent Linear Mappings, Jacobian in input embedding space, low-dimensional semantic structure, Gemma Scope SAE latents` 


- ****Equivalent Linear Mappings** Paper Published**: A member announced the publication of their TMLR paper, [“Equivalent Linear Mappings of Large Language Models”](https://openreview.net/forum?id=oDWbJsIuEp ), demonstrating that LLMs like **Qwen 3 14B** and **Gemma 3 12B** have equivalent linear representations of their inference operation.
   - This approach computes a linear system that captures how the model generates the output embedding from the input embeddings, finding low-dimensional, interpretable semantic structure via SVD.
- **Tangent Model Composition vs. **Jacobian in input embedding space****: A member inquired about the relevance of [Tangent Model Composition](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Liu_Tangent_Model_Composition_for_Ensembling_and_Continual_Fine-tuning_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf) to the published paper.
   - The author clarified that their work focuses on the **Jacobian in input embedding space**, leveraging Euler’s theorem for homogeneous functions of order 1 for exact reconstruction, unlike the Taylor approximation used in tangent model composition.
- **Using Autograd Jacobian on CNNs**: To provide intuition around the Jacobian, a member linked to papers from Zara Khadkhodaie and Eero Simoncelli on image models: [https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19783](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19783), [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02557](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02557), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05478](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05478).
   - These papers work with **CNNs** with (leaky) **ReLUs** and **zero-bias linear layers**, so they can compute the conventional autograd Jacobian at inference.
- **Generalisation finding allows more efficient concept detector**: One member stated that the publication's *generalisation finding allows my concept detector to be even more sample efficient, and your code provides an slower audit grounding for my realtime shorcuts which detect roughly the same thing*.
   - They appreciated the author sharing the work.

- **fastWorkflow Achieves SOTA on Tau Bench**: A member reported that **fastWorkflow** achieved **SOTA** on both retail and airline workflows using [this repo](https://github.com/radiantlogicinc/fastworkflow), and a [paper is coming soon](https://arxiv.org).
   - The [Tau Bench fork](https://github.com/drawal1/tau-bench) with fastWorkflow adapter was used for generating these results, showing that *with proper context engineering, small models can match/beat the big ones*.
- **GEPA for End-to-End Workflow Optimization in Progress**: End-end workflow optimization using **GEPA** is in progress, according to a member, with [attached images](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1202371242519441499/1436153733200347329/image.png?ex=690e91e4&is=690d4064&hm=54f2fdfc7814f4c3679281d0ded01f325a03152d39c92fdad6a94f04bb92e38a&) to show early results.
   - The attached image shows several graphs and metrics, presumably detailing the performance of **GEPA** optimization techniques.

> `Conversation History in DSPy Modules, LLM Context Loss in ReAct Modules, Deserialization of Complex Pydantic OutputFields, DSPy Prompt in Java, Rate Limits for DSPy Batch Requests` 


- **Conversation History persists across LLMs in DSPy**: A user found that conversation history in a DSPy module is maintained even when switching LLMs, because it's part of the signature, not the LM object itself.
   - They wondered how ReAct modules manage history automatically and asked if a complex **Pydantic OutputField** gets deserialized properly.
- **Complex OutputField Deserialization in DSPy**: A user reported issues with complex **Pydantic OutputFields** not deserializing properly in DSPy, resulting in a `str` containing JSON that doesn't match the schema.
   - They also noted the package's dependency on Python < 3.14 and inquired about constraining the LLM's output to conform to a specific type.
- **Running DSPy Prompts in Java**: A user asked about existing solutions for running DSPy prompts in Java, seeking a simplified Java version of **JSONAdapter** to format input/output messages.
   - The suggestion included structuring the system message with input and output fields to facilitate easy JSON handling.
- **Avoiding Context Loss with Fallback LLMs in ReAct**: A user experienced context loss in a **ReAct** module when a fallback LLM was triggered due to rate limits, causing the module to restart from scratch.
   - They sought advice on how to add a fallback LLM without losing the prior context, noting frustration with customization complexities compared to direct API calls.
- **Throttling for DSPy Batch Requests**: A user inquired about methods to handle rate limits when running `dspy.Module.batch` requests, seeking ways to add time delays between requests or respect rate limits properly.
   - No solutions were given in the discussion.

- **ntid Access alternative**: A member inquired about accessing `blockDim` since **Uop SPECIAL** supports `ctaid` and `tid` but not `ntid`.
   - They resolved it by using *a file level const* but mentioned that *the errors for UOps are very unhelpful*.
- **`valid` way to generate `if`s**: A member asked if *`valid`* is the best way to generate *`if`s*, after struggling with ending a range and running stuff outside of the loop.
   - They shared a *cursed kernel generated via UOps*.
- **PyTorch Tensors to Tinygrad Tensors efficiency**: A member asked about the proper way to efficiently convert **PyTorch tensors** to **Tinygrad tensors**.
   - They mentioned using `Tensor.from_blob(pytorch_tensor.data_prt())` for conversion to **Tinygrad** but were unsure about the reverse, currently using `from_numpy`.
