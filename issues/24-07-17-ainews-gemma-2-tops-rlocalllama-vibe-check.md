- **SIMD Optimization with SVE**: A member mentioned that SIMD sizes don't need to be a multiple of 2 and that **SVE** fixes this issue.
   - They suggested implementing drain loops or using masks on architectures without variable-width SIMD.
- **New Mojo nightly compiler released**: A new nightly Mojo compiler release, `2024.7.1714`, is available for update with the command `modular update nightly/mojo`.
   - Changelog includes removal of `SIMD.{min,max}` methods in favor of builtins, adding a `Dict.__init__` overload with `power_of_two_initial_capacity`, and removing `SIMD.{add,mul,sub}_with_overflow` methods.

> - `Mojo utilizing cores`
> - `NumPy performance`
> - `Benchmarking`
> - `BLAS backends`
> - `Intel MKL vs. other BLAS` 


- **Mojo uses only performance cores**: Users observed that on Intel chips with both performance and efficiency cores, the `parallelize` function in **Mojo** exclusively utilizes performance cores for better results.
   - This design decision stems from challenges in efficiently distributing work between performance and efficiency cores with a simple API like `parallelize`. [Details here](https://link.to.issue).
- **Mojo beats NumPy even using fewer cores**: Benchmark results showed **Mojo** outperforming **NumPy** even though it only uses performance cores, while NumPy utilizes all cores.
   - The Mojo runtime isn't yet smart enough to distribute work efficiently across different types of cores as of now, but future updates are expected.
- **Different BLAS backends affect NumPy performance**: Discussed how **NumPy**'s performance can vary significantly based on the BLAS library used; **OpenBLAS** was mentioned with some favoring the use of **Intel MKL** for better speed.
   - Members pointed out that most 'faster than NumPy' claims are usually comparing against NumPy without a good BLAS backend. [Intel's distribution for Python](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/distribution-for-python.html) is recommended.
- **Manual timing and benchmarking reveal insights**: One user switched to manual timing for more accurate benchmarking, revealing interesting performance divots at specific data points like 1024.
   - They noted that some performance drop-offs occur when block sizes slightly exceed 1024, making the second block less computationally efficient.
- **Intel MKL's superior performance**: Intel's MKL was suggested as a much faster alternative to OpenBLAS, even on non-Intel CPUs.
   - This recommendation stems from MKL's widespread adoption in supercomputing for its superior performance over other BLAS libraries.

- **Preference Pairs Sampling Methods in Policy Models**: A discussion mentioned that in some policy models, multiple responses are sampled and the reward model selects the most and least preferred for preference pairs, which are used for DPO.
   - In contrast, **Zephyr** samples from non-winning responses to increase diversity, with an emphasis on the margin between responses.
- **Unchanged Opinions on Non-winning Samples**: An individual confirmed the sampling method, noting that opinions haven't significantly changed on this approach.
   - They clarified that there are few clear explanations or comparisons available.
- **Nemotron Paper On Sampling Criticism**: A participant recalled the `Nemotron` paper, which criticized certain sampling methods by highlighting that some rejected responses might be slightly worse, while others are much worse.
   - This variability can lead to both overfitting and unlearning of high-quality responses, as DPO is ignorant of the quality gap.
- **Zephyr Paper Preference for Random Selection**: The `Zephyr` paper opts for random selection to encourage diversity and challenge the DPO objective.
   - This approach aims to balance learning from hard negatives without climbing in the wrong direction due to false negatives.
