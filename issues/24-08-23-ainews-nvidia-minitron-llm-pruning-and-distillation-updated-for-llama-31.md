original_slug: ainews-nvidia-minitron-llm-pruning-and
description: >-
  **Nvidia** and **Meta** researchers updated their **Llama 3** results with a
  paper demonstrating the effectiveness of combining **weight pruning** and
  **knowledge distillation** to reduce training costs by training only the
  largest model from scratch and deriving smaller models via pruning and
  distillation. The process involves teacher correction, activation-based
  pruning (favoring width pruning), and retraining with distillation using KL
  Divergence loss, resulting in better-performing models at comparable sizes.
  However, distillation incurs some accuracy tradeoffs. Additionally, **AI21
  Labs** launched **Jamba 1.5**, a hybrid SSM-Transformer MoE model with large
  context windows and multilingual support. **Anthropic** updated **Claude 3**
  with LaTeX rendering and prompt caching. An open-source coding-focused LLM,
  **Dracarys**, was released in 70B and 72B sizes, showing improved coding
  performance. The **Mistral Nemo Minitron 8B** model outperforms **Llama 3.1
  8B** and **Mistral 7B** on the Hugging Face leaderboard, highlighting pruning
  and distillation benefits. Research on prompt optimization reveals the
  complexity of prompt search spaces and the surprising effectiveness of simple
  algorithms like AutoPrompt/GCG.

We've obliquely mentioned the 4B and 8B Minitron (Nvidia's distillations of Llama 3.1 8B) a couple times in recent weeks, but there's now [a nice short 7 pager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11796) from Sreenivas & Muralidharan et al ([authors of the Minitron paper last month](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2407.14679)) updating their Llama 2 results for Llama 3:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ba2a2c11-34c6-4e3f-b810-e0e34199e4c5.png?w=960&fit=max) 

The reason this is important provides some insight on Llama 3 given Nvidia's close relatinoship with Meta:

> "training multiple multi-billion parameter models from scratch is extremely time-, data- and resource-intensive. Recent work [1] has demonstrated the effectiveness of combining weight pruning with knowledge distillation to significantly reduce the cost of training LLM model families. Here, **only the biggest model in the family is trained from scratch**; other models are obtained by successively pruning the bigger model(s) and then performing knowledge distillation to recover the accuracy of pruned models.

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/aa85975c-6f1b-4c6c-a723-70924686d925.png?w=960&fit=max) 

The main steps: 

1. **teacher correction** - lightly finetuning the teacher model on the target dataset to be used for distillation, using ∼127B tokens.
2. **depth or width pruning**: using "a purely
activation-based importance estimation strategy that simultaneously computes sensitivity information for all the axes we consider (depth, neuron, head, and embedding channel) using a small calibration dataset and only forward propagation passes". Width pruning consistently outperformed in ablations. ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/412b3028-819e-439f-b68f-b3449d0bdc5a.png?w=960&fit=max) 
3. **Retraining with distillation**: "real" KD, aka using KL Divergence loss on teacher and student logits.  ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/36883594-3e37-4d99-8f6c-3867c3101566.png?w=960&fit=max) 

This produces a generally across-the-board-better model for comparable sizes:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6b67ffa3-d576-44c4-8503-bec0e88e9014.png?w=960&fit=max)

The distillation is far from lossless, however; the paper does not make it easy to read off the deltas but there are footnotes at the end on the tradeoffs.

- **Llama 3.1 performance on various hardware**: Llama 3.1 70B q4 runs on CPU only with a token rate of 1.44 tokens per second on a 9700X with 2 channel DDR5-6000, and 1.37 tokens per second on a W-2155 with 4 channel DDR4-2666. 
   - Some users have reported that offloading to GPU can actually slow down inference if the GPU has less VRAM than half the model size. 
- **Apple Silicon vs Nvidia rigs for LLMs**: A user is debating whether to go for cloud services or a dedicated Nvidia rig for LLMs, after experiencing good results with their M2 24gb Apple Silicon.
   - Another user suggests that Apple Silicon is a consumer-friendly solution for LLMs, with the M2 Ultra outperforming a 4090 in some cases. 
- **Fine tuning models on Apple Silicon**: Apple Silicon is limited for fine tuning due to its memory speed, and users may have to resort to cloud-based services. 
   - A user reports a 9-hour training time for Phi-3 on a max-spec Macbook Pro, highlighting the limitations of Apple Silicon for fine tuning. 
- **Model Accuracy and Evaluation**: LLMs can hallucinate and produce misleading information, especially when asked learning style questions about specific topics. 
   - One user mentions that LLMs like Llama 3.1 and Phi 3 can be verbose and prone to info dumping, while Claude tends to be vague, suggesting it has better self-evaluation mechanisms.

> - `Token Optimization`
> - `Aider's Chat Modes`
> - `Aider as a Chatbot` 


- **Repo Map Details**: The `/repo` command output and repo map are similar but not identical, as the repo map is dynamic and the one displayed by `/repo` may change before it is sent to the LLM.
   - Use the `--verbose` flag to view the actual repo map sent to the LLM.
- **Setting Groq API Key in Windows**: You need to restart your terminal after setting the GROQ_API_KEY environment variable using `setx`.
   - A user reported receiving an argument error when trying to set the API key using `setx`, but after restarting the terminal, the issue was resolved.
- **Optimizing Token Usage**: A user is looking for documentation on optimizing token usage, specifically in relation to small Python files that are still exceeding the OpenAI limit.
   - The user is requesting changes like calculations and rendering that would potentially require a multi-step process, and is looking for ways to reduce the token context.
- **Aider's Chat Modes**: A user inquired about using Aider as a regular chatbot interface for non-coding tasks.
   - The user was advised to switch to `ask` mode using `/chat-mode ask` and was provided a link to the Aider documentation for further reference.
- **Aider as a Chatbot**: A user wanted to use Aider as a chatbot for non-coding tasks like asking questions about the distance between Earth and the Moon.
   - The user was advised to create a `CONVENTIONS.md` file with a prompt instructing Aider to act like a chatbot, and was given an example and a link to the Aider documentation.

- **SmolLM: Smaller Language Models**: SmolLM is a series of smaller language models in three sizes: 135M, 360M, and 1.7B parameters, trained on a meticulously curated dataset called Cosmo-Corpus.
   - Cosmo-Corpus includes Cosmopedia v2, Python-Edu, and FineWeb-Edu, and SmolLM models have shown promising results when compared to other models in their size categories.
- **Mamba: Transformers Compatible Language Model**: This repository contains the `transformers` compatible `mamba-2.8b` model.
   - You need to install `transformers` from `main` until `transformers=4.39.0` is released and install `causal_conv_1d` and `mamba-ssm` for the optimised `cuda` kernels.
- **Cosmo2-tokenizer: Tokenizer for Cosmo2 Training**: This tokenizer was trained on 1M samples from various datasets, including FineWeb-Edu, Cosmopedia v2, StarCoderData, OpenWebMath, and StackOverFlow.
   - Downloads are not tracked for this model, but the tokenizer was trained with a specific focus on educational content and code.
- **The Missing BOS Token Mystery**: Neither cosmo2-tokenizer nor SmolLM/Mamba series have distinct beginning of sentence (BOS) tokens.
   - While technically they do have a BOS token, it is the same as the end of sentence (EOS) token, leading to potential issues during pretraining.

- **Prompting Strategies in LangChain for SQL Queries**: This document from the **LangChain Python Documentation** (<https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/sql_prompting/#table-definitions-and-example-rows>) outlines strategies to improve SQL query generation using **create_sql_query_chain**.
   - It covers how the **dialect of the SQLDatabase** impacts the prompt of the chain, how to format schema information into the prompt using **SQLDatabase.get_context**, and how to build and select few-shot examples to assist the model.
- **Explicit Context Passing in LangChain Chains**: The line of code `prompt_with_context = chain.get_prompts()[0].partial(table_info=context["table_info"])` is not passed by default in LangChain.
   - You need to explicitly pass the context, which includes the `table_info`, when calling the chain as demonstrated in the LangChain Python Documentation.
- **LangChain Chain Inspection**: The **get_prompts()** method is used to retrieve the prompts used in a LangChain chain.
   - This method is discussed in the **LangChain Python Documentation** (<https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/inspect/#get-the-prompts>), which covers methods for programmatically introspecting the internal steps of chains.
