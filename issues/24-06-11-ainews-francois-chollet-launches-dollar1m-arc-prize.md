<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Nonmemorizable Benchmarks are all you need.**

> AI News for 6/10/2024-6/11/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**412** channels, and **2774** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **313 minutes**.

In [this weekend's Latent Space pod we talked about test set contamination and the Science of Benchmarking](https://www.latent.space/p/iclr-2024-benchmarks-agents), and today one of the OGs in the field is back with a solution - generate a bunch of pattern-recognition-and-completion benchmarks:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/17cec8b3-b977-41dd-a6c5-f5aad99b812a.png?w=960&fit=max) 

You can play with the ARC-AGI puzzles yourself to get a sense for what "easy for humans hard for AI" puzzles look like:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/30ef397c-2045-45aa-a3b2-b6a10d41e64b.png?w=960&fit=max) 

This all presumes an opinionated definition of AGI, which the team gracefully provides:

> DEFINING AGI
> 
> Consensus but wrong:
> **AGI is a system that can automate the majority of economically valuable work.**
> 
> Correct:
> **AGI is a system that can efficiently acquire new skills and solve open-ended problems.**
> 
> Definitions are important. We turn them into benchmarks to measure progress toward AGI.
> Without AGI, we will never have systems that can invent and discover alongside humans.

This benchmark is curved to resist the classic 1-2 year saturation cycle that other benchmarks have faced:

[The solution guide](https://arcprize.org/guide) offers François' thoughts on promising directions, including Discrete program search, skill acquisition, and hybrid approaches.

Last week the Dwarkesh pod was making waves predicting [AGI in 2027](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/leopold-aschenbrenner), and today [it's back](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/francois-chollet) with 
François Chollet asserting that the path we're on won't lead to AGI. Which way, AGI observoor?
