> AI News for 5/17/2024-5/20/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**366** channels, and **9564** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **1116 minutes**.

While it was a relatively lively weekend, most of the debate was nontechnical in nature, with no announcements being an obvious candidate for this top feature. 

So have a list of minor notes in its place:

- We have deprecated some inactive Discords and **added Hamel Husain and Dan Becker's new LLM Finetuning Discord** for his popular Maven course ([affiliate link here](https://maven.com/parlance-labs/fine-tuning?utm_campaign=29ce77&utm_medium=partner&utm_source=instructor))

- **Squeak Meets Claude**: A discussion emerged about integrating **Claude3** with **Squeak Smalltalk**, signaling interest in combining cutting-edge AI with classic programming environments. Practical application details remain to be hashed out.
  
- **Voice Modes Get a Makeover**: Within GPT-4o, a voice named **Sky** was replaced by **Juniper** after concerns arose about resemblance to Scarlett Johansson's voice. The shift from multi-model to a singular model approach in GPT-4o aims to reduce latency and enhance emotional expression, albeit increasing complexity ([Voice Chat FAQ](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8400625-voice-chat-faq)).

- **AI's Double-Edged Sword**: As models like GPT-4o evolve, they face challenges such as potential for **prompt injection** and unpredictable behaviors, which can be as problematic as legacy systems encountering unexpected commands.

- **The Never-Ending Improvement Loop**: Echoing Stainslaw Lem's "The Upside-Down Evolution," resilience in AI and other complex systems was discussed, with the understanding that while perfect reliability is a myth, fostering fault-tolerant designs is crucial—even as it leads to new unforeseen issues.

# PART 2: Detailed by-Channel summaries and links



**Unsloth AI (Daniel Han) ▷ #[general](https://discord.com/channels/1179035537009545276/1179035537529643040/1240921967327187047)** (718 messages🔥🔥🔥): 

- **Deepseek doesn't work yet:** Users discussed that Deepseek is not functional due to its different architecture. One pointed out that *"it probs doesn't work,"* and another confirmed, *"Deepseek won't work yet."*
- **Handling large datasets on Colab/Kaggle:** A user asked if a 6GB dataset could fit with a 5GB Llama3 model on Colab or Kaggle T4. Opinions differed but it was noted that *"datasets (hf library) doesn't load the dataset in the ram"*; thus, it's more of a storage issue than a VRAM limit.
- **JAX TPUs train well despite skepticism:** There was a heated debate about using JAX on TPUs, with one user asserting it trains fine on Google TPUs. *"You can train on TPU even with torch, but Jax is pretty much what's used mainly in production,"* was one key insight.
- **Effective fine-tuning hacks discussed:** Notably, kearm discussed a refined method to *"remove guardrails"* in Meta-Llama models using *"orthogonalized bfloat16 safetensor weights"*, and suggested that *Llama-3-70B Instruct* can now be finetuned effectively and cheaply.
- **Legal concerns and AI fine-tuning:** Users pondered the risks of using famous IPs for finetuning models, even as others mentioned ongoing lawsuits, like *Scarlet Johansson suing OpenAI*. *"She may win that,"* was a sentiment echoed over legal battles.

- **HVM uses implicitly parallel program model**: In response to how the [HVM](https://higherorderco.com/) achieves automatic parallelization, it was clarified that HVM runs an already-parallel algorithm in functional form (e.g., Haskell). Despite its cool concept, its performance is slower than CPython for CPU and less than Mojo for GPU as noted in a [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40390287).
- **Excitement about Mojo’s GPU and accelerator support**: Following the Bend announcement, there is excitement about how **Mojo** will support **GPUs and accelerators**.
- **Shared-memory IPC for speed-critical programs**: Programs crucial for speed already use shared-memory IPC, which minimizes latency significantly. The potential for **DPDK and SPDK** to become more widely used due to their performance was discussed, with hopes for improved usability and integration with Mojo.
- **Old hardware and MMU dependencies**: Important software often gets slower under certain execution models, necessitating the continued use of MMUs until old hardware can be retired. Concerns were brought up about old hardware using DMA outside allowed regions and 64-bit pointer limitations in **CXL devices**, suggesting that the tail of old hardware will persist.
- **Prospects for io_uring-like APIs**: Future advancements may come from io_uring-like APIs, which utilize syscalls as control path mechanisms and shared-memory for communication with the kernel. This could eliminate most overhead, focusing on improved APIs as seen in Jens Axboe’s work.

- **Implementing `__iter__` and `__contains__` for Tuple sparks debates**: A member worked on implementing `__iter__` and `__contains__` for `Tuple` and faced issues over `tuple_mutability` and `tuple_lifetime`. This led to discussions on the practicality and design choices of using `Tuple` for iterables in Mojo, referencing related GitHub issues like [issue #2658](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/2658).
- **Exploring Collection and Pointer Operations**: A lively discussion on the proper use of various collection types and operations, including `ListLiteral`, `Tuple`, `i1`, and `SIMD`. Debate about the role of `rebind` and defining MLIR types was prominent.
- **Feature requests and enhancements, including Unicode and allocations in unit tests**: Members suggested features like [assert max allocations in unit tests](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/2725) and better Unicode support, asking about timelines and feasibility for community contribution.
- **Parallelism using thread safety and coroutine models**: Members engaged in a deep dive into Mojo's approach to thread safety and parallelism, debating between OpenMP-like syntax and Rust’s async model. 
- **Mojo's Tensor Implementation Strategy**: Chris Lattner clarified that the Mojo standard library would not include definitive tensor implementations, ensuring flexibility for developers. There was consensus on the need for a unified tensor trait while maintaining modular implementation approaches.

- **Rust and Go share memory allocation techniques**: Discussion reveals Rust's **Vec** and Go's slices both double the capacity when appending elements until a certain threshold, then Go increments by 25%. Relevant links include Rust’s [raw_vec.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/alloc/src/raw_vec.rs#L464) and [Go's runtime slice](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/cb2353deb74ecc1ca2105be44881c5d563a00fb8/src/runtime/slice.go#L95).

- **Optimization insights for list capacities in Mojo**: Tuning the list initialization capacity in Mojo (e.g., `List[Int](capacity=N+50)`) yielded 2x performance improvement compared to default settings. Clattner confirmed a forthcoming patch addressing def’s input argument copying will further enhance performance.

- **Discussion on SIMD gather/scatter optimizations**: Members debated the effectiveness of masked gather and scatter instructions in Mojo, particularly on different architectures like x86 with AVX512 and ARM SVE. While users shared mixed results, one voiced that recalculating values might sometimes be more beneficial than using a lookup table due to potential memory wall issues. 

- **Potential new List method suggestion for optimization**: A member suggested adding a method like Rust's `Vec::shrink_to_fit()` to Mojo’s List to optimize allocated space, sharing [a simple implementation](https://github.com/dorjeduck/mostring) they used in MoString.

- **Community praises Clattner's detailed insights**: A member expressed gratitude towards Chris Lattner for sharing deep technical insights on Mojo's internal workings, which significantly helped them understand and optimize their code better.

- **Phorm assists with ORPO format queries**: Users inquired about the ORPO (Object-Role-Property-Operation) format. Though no specific implementation details were given, it was noted that **ORPO is used for structuring data/operations** and an example in Axolotl included its use in prompt strategies.

- **Weight decay clarified for LLM training**: Members discussed weight decay, which acts as a regularization technique **preventing overfitting** by adding a penalty to the loss function. This ensures model weights remain small, leading to better generalization.

- **LoRA Dropout explained**: LoRA Dropout helps in fine-tuning LLMs by introducing dropout in the **low-rank adaptation matrices**, preventing overfitting and improving generalization.

- **Gradient accumulation benefits LLM training**: Gradient accumulation enables training with larger effective batch sizes without increasing memory usage, which is crucial for LLM stability and efficiency. This approach was exemplified using PyTorch and the **Hugging Face Accelerator library**.

- **Sample weights in Axolotl**: A member sought to assign **sample weights without customizing loss functions**. It was recommended to use sample weights in the `compute_loss` method for custom loss handling, while cautioning that not all loss functions support this natively.
