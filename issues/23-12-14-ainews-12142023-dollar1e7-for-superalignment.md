- **LLM-Assisted Scoring Evaluation Experiment**: User `@_jp1_` shared a post from Reddit about an early-stage AI startup's results using their LLM-assisted batch evaluation tool. The tool is used for highlight extraction from news articles and the MMLU benchmark using a scoring model. They referenced three [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13711), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17631), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08491) different research papers as the basis of their evaluation method. This led to a discussion about whether reducing score categories and using special rating tokens could influence accuracy and the ability to discriminate. [Link to the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18id0pa/experimenting_with_llmassisted_scoring_eval/)
  
- **Potential Collaboration**: User `@bjoernp` expressed interest in the evaluation approach and suggested collaboration with the startup working on similar projects.

- **Evaluation Method Understanding**: A discussion between `@bjoernp` and `@_jp1_` ensued concerning the circular nature of using benchmarks for evaluation models. They talked about how a good benchmark could negate the need for an eval model and how the use of evaluation models is often resorted to when there is no easy way to benchmark or it would be too much effort to create benchmarks for everything to measure.

- **Confusion on Benchmarking and Evaluation Models**: `@_jp1_` expressed confusion over the evaluation method and questioned if measuring MMLU of the eval model is similar to direct model evaluation. `@bjoernp` acknowledged the similarity but noted a slight difference, stating that rating a response is an easier task.

- **Other potential benchmark**: In their conclusion, `@bjoernp` suggested that a held-out test set could potentially be a good benchmark for the rating model.

- **OpenAI's Alignment Plan**: `@_jp1_` brought attention to the interesting content in OpenAI's new paper regarding their alignment plan. No link was provided.
- **Discussion on Phi-2**: `@bjoernp` and `@flozi00` engaged in conversation about **Phi-2**, questioning its effectiveness and the legitimacy of its benchmarks. While `@bjoernp` showed skepticism, `@flozi00` shared some optimistic observations from Twitter examples, especially for smaller scale uses cases on edge.
- **Data Quality Scoring Models in Disco Research**: `@flozi00` suggested the implementation of scoring models to enhance data quality in Disco Research. The aim is to not only deduplicate datasets, but also cleanse them of low-quality data like **raw lists from Wikipedia or translation errors**.


### ▷ #[benchmark_dev](https://discord.com/channels/1178995845727785010/1183158791605330051/) (13 messages🔥): 
        
- **Collaboration on Simplified Language Understanding and Modeling (Llama) Integration**: `@bjoernp` requested `@rtyax` for collaboration on incorporating llama.cpp into their project and asked for clarity on the problems related to tokenizer that `@rtyax` had mentioned earlier.
- **FastEval Evaluation Completion and Future Steps**: `@bjoernp` outlined the next steps including adding the capacity for n repetitions of benchmarks and calculating the mean and standard deviation, thereby completing a substantial part of the evaluations. He also pointed out the continued need for the integration with llama.cpp to examine the effects of min_p and enabling grammar-based inference to fix the output format.
- **FastEval Repository on DiscoResearch GitHub**: `@bjoernp` created a fork of FastEval with the DiscoResearch GitHub account for coordination, directing users and `@rtyax` to submit their changes there. The repository is found at [https://github.com/DiscoResearch/FastEval](https://github.com/DiscoResearch/FastEval).
- **Issues with Llama-cpp-python**: `@rtyax` reported that llama-cpp-python was failing silently when running generate/chat_completion. They noted that the difficulty may not be with the tokenizer, but could not identify the specific problem. They had recently rebuilt llama-cpp-python for mixtral, and were uncertain if the problem was local or more widespread.
- **Debugging Suggestions**: `@bjoernp` suggested debugging simpler models first, like mistral-7b, and changing fasteval evaluation constants to use a single thread for the local model. `@rtyax` said that only one GPU was being used in his box, but the generation was continuing as if it was never called due to a try/catch block.

Only 1 channel had activity, so no need to summarize...

- **AI Economics Discussion**: `@stevekamman` shared insights on the **economics of AI**, specifically focusing on the comparison between *training* and *inference cost and revenues*. He said: *"Inference must pay the bills - GPU, S&M, overheads..."* and pointed out that the *revenue* generated by inference must be noticeably higher than the *cost* associated with training to maintain profitability in the long term.
- **Consideration on Training Costs**: `@stevekamman` noted that the *cost incurred in training can be offset by selling the foundational models* but he also pointed out that it's inevitable for the buyers of these models to fund the purchase either through revenue or efficiency gains.
- **Future of FM Companies**: `@spillai` speculated on whether *foundation model (FM) companies need to develop their own clouds* to continue capturing enough long-term value from their customers and therefore attain profitability. They drew attention to the potential need for *vertical AI infrastructure providers* for large language models (LLMs).
- **Utilization of GPU by FM companies**: `@stevekamman` questioned the utilization efficiencies of GPUs by FM companies, given their binary nature (100% or 0% utilization). This, considering how potential scale-based utilization efficiencies might be limited.
