> AI News for 8/27/2024-8/28/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**215** channels, and **2366** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **239 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

A brief history of superfast LLM inference in 2024:

- Groq dominated the news cycle in Feb (lots of [scattered discussion here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-karpathy-emerges-from-stealth/#latent-space-discord-summary)) by achieving [~450 tok/s for Mixtral 8x7B](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/groq-inference-tokenomics-speed-but) ([240 tok/s for Llama 2 70b](https://groq.com/news_press/groq-lpu-inference-engine-leads-in-first-independent-llm-benchmark/)).
- In May, Cursor [touted a specialized code edit model](https://www.cursor.com/blog/instant-apply) (developed with Fireworks) that hit 1000 tok/s.

It is now finally Cerebras' turn to shine. The new [Cerebras Inference service](https://x.com/CerebrasSystems/status/1828464491677524311) is touting Llama3.1-8b at 1800 tok/s at $0.10/mtok and Llama3.1-70B at 450 tokens/s at $0.60/mtok **at full precision**. Needless to say, Cerebras pricing at full precision AND their unmatched speed is suddenly a serious player in this market. To take their marketing line: "**Cerebras Inference runs Llama3.1 20x faster than GPU solutions at 1/5 the price.**" - not technically true - most inference providers like [Together](https://www.together.ai/blog/together-inference-engine-2) and [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireworks-quantization) tend to guide people towards the quantized versions of their services, with FP8 70B priced at $0.88/mtok and INT4 70B priced at $0.54. Indisputably better, but not 5x cheaper, not 20x faster.

> Note: one should also note their very generous free tier of **1 million free tokens daily**.

The secret, of course, is Cerebras' wafer-scale chips (what else would you expect them to say?). Similar to Groq's LPU argument, Cerebras says putting the entire model in SRAM is the key:

Your move, Groq and Sambanova.

- **VAEs for Text-Image Generation: Why Not More Popular?**: A user asks why Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for generating text from images, by encoding the image into a shared latent space and decoding it through a text decoder or vice versa, are not more widely adopted in research and practical applications.
- **Transformers Library Good-First-Issue**: A user asks if anyone is interested in a 'good-first-issue' for the transformers library and links to a specific issue about weight initialization for DeformableDetr.
   - This issue aims to ensure that all weight initializations are performed in the _init_weights method of the corresponding PretrainedModel class.
- **Document Quality Assessment: Identifying Blurred, Dark, or Blank Docs**: A user seeks a way to assess document quality, specifically identifying if an uploaded document is blurred, dark, or blank, without readily available training data.
   - They attempted to address this by scraping public printed documents and augmenting them by adding blurs, but the performance was subpar, as replicating real-life document photos proved challenging.

- **GameNGen - The First Neural Game Engine**: The paper introduces _GameNGen_, the first game engine powered entirely by a neural model, enabling real-time interaction with a complex environment over long trajectories at high quality.
   - This model can interactively simulate the classic game DOOM at over 20 frames per second on a single TPU, achieving a PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression.
- **GameNGen Simulates DOOM**: Real-time recordings of people playing the game [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) are simulated entirely by the _GameNGen_ neural model.
   - Human raters are only slightly better than random chance at distinguishing short clips of the game from clips of the simulation.
- **GameNGen Training Phases**: _GameNGen_ is trained in two phases: (1) an RL-agent learns to play the game and the training sessions are recorded, and (2) a diffusion model is trained to produce the game's visual output.
- **Real-Time Game Engines Using Diffusion Models**: The paper explores the potential of diffusion models in creating real-time game engines.
   - This research highlights the significant advancements in AI for simulating complex environments and real-time interaction.

> - `Hermes 3`
> - `Llama 3.1 8B on CPU`
> - `Model Size and RAM`
> - `Conversation Topic Tagging` 


- **Finetuning with Synthetic Data: A New Frontier**: It is a common misconception that finetuning using data generated by another model is not recommended, but the cutting edge is very much focused on synthetic data training.
   - Examples include Hermes 3, which utilizes tons of synthetic data, and rumored "strawberry models" that rely heavily on it, but it requires a good filtering pipeline.
- **Llama 3.1 8B on CPU: Performance Expectations**: Running Llama 3.1 8B on a VPS/baremetal machine without a GPU card requires 6GB of RAM and will result in slow performance of 5-10 tokens per second using gguf.
   - 8-bit quantization might require 12GB of RAM, and the performance might be around 2-5 seconds per token, but this is not necessarily linear.
- **Model Size and RAM: A Practical Guide**: The size of an 8-bit quantized model is roughly half the size in parameters compared to the original model, with an additional 2GB of overhead.
   - For example, an 8B model would require around 102GB of overhead on top of the actual model size.
- **Tagging Conversations with Topics: Decoder Only or Encoder-Decoder?**: For tagging conversations with a topic (2-3 words) without fixed classes, a decoder-only transformer or an encoder-decoder architecture could be used.
   - One suggestion was to fine-tune any LLM and make the LM head output only the desired number of tags, referencing the LMSys competition for potential code examples.
- **Explaining RAG Systems in a ChatGPT Interface**: A simple RAG system could be explained in the context of a ChatGPT interface by allowing users to input a PDF link and then run a RAG mechanism.
   - To differentiate a simple RAG system from a more advanced one, emphasize the additional features and complexities of the advanced system, such as incorporating more sophisticated document processing or retrieval methods.

> - `Mojo Circular Imports`
> - `Python Circular Imports`
> - `Mojo Compiler Optimization`
> - `Mojo Top Level Statements` 


- **Mojo Handles Circular Imports**: Mojo is a compiled language so it can scan each file and determine the shapes of structs before compiling.
   - The compiler can then resolve the rest of the operations because it has all the functions it needs to implement `to_queue`.
- **Python's Problem with Circular Imports**: In Python, circular imports can cause problems because it runs everything in sequence during compilation.
   - Mojo's approach to circular imports avoids these issues, as it doesn't have to run everything in sequence.
- **Mojo Compiler Optimizes Struct Sizes**: Mojo's compiler knows the size of a pointer, so it can figure out the shape of `List` without needing to look at `Queue`.
   - This allows the compiler to resolve circular imports by using an `Arc` or some other type of pointer to break the loop.
- **Mojo's Future with Top Level Statements**: Mojo doesn't have top-level statements yet, but it's expected to handle circular imports there by running the top-level code before `main` starts in the order of imports.
   - This will ensure that circular imports are resolved correctly and efficiently.

- **Mojo's Unusual Performance Curve**: A user observed a sharp increase in performance at around 1125 fields, speculating that a **smallvec** or **arena** might be overflowing.
   - Another user suggested that a **1024 parameter** single file might be the cause.
- **Named Return Slots in Mojo**: Mojo supports named return slots, allowing for syntax like `fn thing() -> String as result: result = "foo"`.
   - The syntax is likely to change, but this feature appears to be intended for "placement new" within the callee frame.
- **Non-movable Types in Mojo**: Mojo allows for types that are not movable, such as `fn foo(a: Int) -> NonMovable:`.
   - These types are compiled into the C++ equivalent of `void foo(int, NonMovable&)` and the caller passes the location to initialize.
- **Mojo's Ownership Model Explained**: Mojo is very smart and disciplined, typically avoiding implicit moves and performing copy->move optimization.
   - A blog post and video delve into the concept of ownership in Mojo, providing a mental model for understanding memory management.
- **Mojo's Debugging Strategy**: Debugging is a priority for Mojo and MAX, aiming to improve the debugging experience compared to the traditional Python, C++, and CUDA stack.
   - Machine learning often requires inspecting the state of a program after a long running process, requiring debugging features tailored to this specific area.
