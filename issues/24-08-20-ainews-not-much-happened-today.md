> - `Triton Error`
> - `Triton kernel optimization`
> - `constexpr type` 


- **Triton kernel optimization**: A user encountered a `ValueError` while attempting to use `tl.arange` with a non-constexpr value `seqlen` in a `triton.jit` kernel.
   - The user, a beginner with Triton, asked for help with the error, and was pointed to the specific line causing the issue: `base_idx_hidden_states = base_idx + tl.arange(0, seqlen)[:, None] * head_dim`. 
- **constexpr type in Triton**: The issue arose because `seqlen` was not declared as a `tl.constexpr` type, which is required for the `tl.arange` function in Triton.
   - The user was advised to explicitly specify the type of the variable `seqlen` within the function definition itself to resolve the error. 
- **Triton compiler behavior**: The user noted that this type specification was not needed in Python generally, where type inference is usually handled automatically.

- **H100 L2 cache optimization: reversing the hash**: The author was trying to reverse engineer the hash function for the L2 cache on H100 GPUs and discovered that the only dynamic data appears to be a single bit per 2 MiB (MMU page).
   - This bit changes at a 4KiB granularity, is always balanced 50/50 every 64KiB, and can be handled efficiently with persistent threads.
- **Competing with NVIDIA on memcpy**: While the author hasn't yet tried to beat NVIDIA at matrix multiplication, they are considering optimizing memory copy operations first.
   - The goal is to achieve better power efficiency compared to NVIDIA's implementation, and potentially simplify the complexity of llm.c.
- **Eliminating dynamic memory allocation with cuMemAddressReserve**: The author realized that cuMemAddressReserve combined with cuMemMap/cuMemUnmap can completely eliminate the dynamic aspect of memory allocation.
   - This allows for deterministic allocation of physical pages based on a simple hash, potentially leading to optimized elementwise kernels in both llm.c and PyTorch.

- **JPEG Encoding: A Viable Image Tokenization Method?**: A research paper suggests that JPEG encoding could be a good method for tokenizing images, but current AR-based approaches face significant information loss, resulting in poor image quality.
   - The paper uses a JPEG quality setting of 25, making it theoretically impossible to generate high-quality images from the tokens, and compresses a 256*256 image to around 5,000 tokens, leading to longer training and inference times compared to traditional VQ-VAE.
- **Uncertainties About Image Compression Limits**: The author questions the maximum compression achievable for images, as the paper uses a JPEG quality setting of 25 for tokenization.
- **Training Models on H.265 or AV1 Frames**: The author suggests exploring the possibility of training models on H.265 frames, or even AV1 frames, as an alternative to JPEG encoding.
