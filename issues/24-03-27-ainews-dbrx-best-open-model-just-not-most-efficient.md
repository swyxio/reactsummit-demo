title: 'DBRX: Best open model (just not most efficient)'
date: '2024-03-27T22:33:19.363427Z'
original_slug: ainews-dbrx-best-open-model-but-not-most-efficient
description: >-
  **Databricks Mosaic** has released a new open-source model called **DBRX**
  that outperforms **Grok**, **Mixtral**, and **Llama2** on evaluations while
  being about **2x more efficient** than Llama2 and Grok. The model was trained
  on **12 trillion tokens** using **3,000 H100 GPUs** over 2 months, with an
  estimated compute cost of **$10 million**. It uses OpenAI's **100k tiktoken
  tokenizer** and shows strong zero-shot code generation performance, even
  beating **GPT-4** on the Humaneval benchmark. DBRX also upstreamed work to
  **MegaBlocks** open source. Despite its scale and efficiency, DBRX's
  performance on MMLU is only slightly better than Mixtral, raising questions
  about its scaling efficiency. The focus of DBRX is on enabling users to train
  models efficiently, with MoE training being about **2x more FLOP-efficient**
  than dense models, achieving similar quality with nearly **4x less compute**
  than previous MPT models. This release is part of the ongoing competition for
  open-source AI leadership, including models like **Dolly**, **MPT**, and
  **Mistral**. *"If it activates 36B params, the model's perf should be
  equivalent to a 72B dense model or even 80B,"* says Qwen's tech lead.

There's a LOT to like about Databricks Mosaic's new model ([Corporate blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [team blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/announcing-dbrx-new-standard-efficient-open-source-customizable-llms?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [free HF space demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/databricks/dbrx-instruct?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [GitHub](https://github.com/databricks/dbrx?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39838104&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [Jon Frankle tweet](https://x.com/jefrankle/status/1772961586497425683?s=46&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [Vitaliy Chiley tweet](https://x.com/vitaliychiley/status/1772958872891752868?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug), [Wired puff piece](https://www.wired.com/story/dbrx-inside-the-creation-of-the-worlds-most-powerful-open-source-ai-model/?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [terrible horrible no good very bad Techcrunch take](https://x.com/migtissera/status/1773030280539865495?s=20&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [Daniel Han arch review](https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1772981050530316467?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [Qwen lead response](https://twitter.com/JustinLin610/status/1773037453101924675)):

- It beats Grok and Mixtral and LLama2 on evals (all of which beat GPT3.5 for breakfast), and is about 2x more efficient than Llama2 and Grok
- It's **[about $10m](https://twitter.com/migtissera/status/1773063735550022094?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)** worth of compute released as (kinda) open weights, trained in 2 months on 3k H100's.
- It's trained on **[12 trillion](https://x.com/Teknium1/status/1772963762485571666?s=20&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)** (undisclosed) tokens (most open models stop at 2-2.5T, but of course **[Redpajama 2 offers up to 30T](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/17om8xf/redpajamadatav2_is_incredible/?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)**)
- This new dataset + the new choice of adopting OpenAI's 100k tiktoken tokenizer (recognizing 3 digit numbers properly and adopting native ChatML format) was [at least 2x better token-for-token than MPT-7B's data](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm).
- It is **[surprisingly](https://twitter.com/jefrankle/status/1772961617728197056?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)** good at code (**[beat GPT4 at 0 shot, pass@1 humaneval](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1772972997990580381?s=20&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)**)

All is truly great but you *also* have to be really good at reading between the lines to find what we're *not* saying above... 

…or just read the right discords:

![https://assets.buttondown.email/images/c9622806-2c2c-42b6-8629-b0178e19ff27.png?w=960&fit=max](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/c9622806-2c2c-42b6-8629-b0178e19ff27.png?w=960&fit=max)

In other words, a new MoE model trained on >12x the data and +50% the experts (and having +70% the param count per expert - 12 choose 4 of 12B experts vs 8 choose 2 of 7B experts) of Mixtral is somehow *only* 1% better than Mixtral on MMLU (however it is indeed great on coding). Weird, no? As Qwen's tech lead [says](https://twitter.com/JustinLin610/status/1773037453101924675):

> "If it acativates 36B params, the model's perf should be equivalent to a 72B dense model or even 80B. In consideration of training on 12T tokens, I think it has the potential to be much better. 78 or higher for MMLU is what I expect."

Like **[Dolly](https://www.latent.space/p/mike-conover?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)** and **[MPT](https://www.latent.space/p/mosaic-mpt-7b?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)** before it, the main focus is more that "you can train models with us" than it is about really going after **[Mistral's open source crown](https://www.latent.space/p/oct-2023?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)**:

> "Our customers will find that training MoEs is also about 2x more FLOP-efficient than training dense models for the same final model quality. End-to-end, our overall recipe for DBRX (including the pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization strategy) can match the quality of our previous-generation MPT models with nearly 4x less compute."

Mosaic is already talking up the recent Lilac acquisition as a part of the story:

While it's not open-weight, the promise of new SOTA benchmarks stirs up the community, alongside discussions of a constrictive license preventing use in improving other models.

- **Exploring LLMs for Languages Beyond English**: A discussion highlighted an approach by Yanolja for expanding LLMs in Korean by pre-training embeddings for new tokens and partially fine-tuning existing tokens. This technique is outlined as a potential path for those interested in developing LLMs in additional languages; the detailed strategy is provided in the [Yanolja Model Documentation](https://huggingface.co/yanolja/EEVE-Korean-10.8B-v1.0).

- **Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA) Surpasses LoRA**: A new research paper was shared, suggesting that LISA outperforms standard LoRA training and full parameter training while retaining low memory usage, indicating promise for large-scale training settings. The paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919).

- **Introducing LoadImg Library**: A new Python library called **loadimg** has been created to load images of various types, with all outputs currently as Pillow type. Future updates aim to support more input types and output formats; the library is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/not-lain/loadimg).

- **Tinygrad Optimizations Explained**: A member shared insights on how _cumsum's global_size and local_size are determined, noting that using `NOOPT=1` makes everything stay on global while default hand-coded optimizations use heuristics. They also indicated wanting to understand the implementation better, discussing how heuristics such as long reduces and float4 vectorization are applied.

- **Exploring regularization images for training**: A discussion is initiated regarding the creation and properties of regularization images for training. It's suggested to open a further discussion on [HuggingFace Diffusers' GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/discussions) for community input on what makes a good regularization set.

## [Nous Research AI](https://discord.com/channels/1053877538025386074) Discord

**LLMs Face Memory Games and Falter**: LLMs like **Mistral 7B** and **Mixtral** are finding it challenging to perform in-context recall tasks, which involve **splitting and repeating sentences** while maintaining their original context positions, even at token counts as low as 2500 or 5000. A benchmark to evaluate in-context recall called the **ai8hyf split and recall test** has been made available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ai8hyf/llm_split_recall_test), provoking conversations on the necessity for exact string matching and recall in sizable contexts.

**Mixed Views on DBRX and Other Open Models**: The community's hands-on experience with **DBRX** has been less than impressive, with feedback pointing to possible improvements via better fine-tuning or system prompt changes. Comparisons among various open models including **Mixtral**, **Grok-1**, **Lemur-70B**, and **Nous Pro** brought to light **Mixtral**'s commendable performance, while some larger models did not see expected gains, spawning conversations about the MoE models' memory intensive nature and their trade-offs.

**Innovations with Voice and Vision**: The integration of voice chat using **Deepgram & Mistral AI** technology is showcased through a shared [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kan7GofHSwg), while **ASRock’s Intel Arc A770 Graphics** card is highlighted for its favorable specs over alternatives like the RTX 4070. Moreover, Databricks' release of open-license MoE LLM called **DBRX Instruct** offers a new player in the specialized domain of few-turn interactions, accessible via [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-instruct).

**AI Conversations Take Whimsical Turns**: World simulations involve AI displaying a penchant for characters like **Sherlock Holmes** and offbeat self-portrayals as trees and otherworldly beings, offering both amusement and unique roleplaying data. Meanwhile, issues with mobile responsiveness are being flagged, particularly on Samsung devices within the WorldSim framework.

**RAG-ing Discussion and Collaborative Hermes**: The community is actively discussing the critical role of retrieval in **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**, alongside inventive approaches like **Retrieval Augmented Thoughts (RAT)** that couple RAG with Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. A concerted effort is underway to advance **Hermes**, emphasizing datasets and techniques to enhance capabilities, documented in a [collaborative Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o8asa0hD0qK5mKkdY5riUeGm-bxKzL02--1r3MgPgdM/edit?usp=sharing) and noting the community's eagerness to contribute.

- **Quest for Learning NLP**: A member sought recommendations for learning NLP, and another member responded with a link to Hugging Face's [learning resources](https://huggingface.co/learn), which include courses on NLP, Deep RL, Audio, an AI Cookbook, and ML for Games.
- **Concerns About LLM Download Times**: A user experienced more than 8 hours of download time for the Mistral 7B model through LM Studio on Ubuntu 22.04. The process seemed unusually slow but eventually completed, leading to a discussion on whether high CPU usage percentages over 100% are viable or indicative of an issue.
- **Misleading Model Capabilities**: In a discussion about language model capabilities, it was noted that models like CodeLlama do not actually access emails or Git but may generate affirmative, potentially misleading responses. Users are advised to rely on documentation rather than the model-generated assertions about capabilities.
- **Deciphering LLMs on MacBook GPUs**: Members exchanged insights about running large language models (LLMs) like Mistral and Llama on local devices, such as a MacBook with M1 chip, using tools like llama.cpp and Ollama, which can utilize shared memory architecture for efficient operation.
- **TensorRT-LLM vs Other Frameworks for GPU Performance**: In a discussion about using AWS SageMaker for running LLM inference with different frameworks, a user mentioned alternatives such as Runpod, Vast AI, and Kaggle may offer more flexibility and lower cost compared to AWS, but AWS might provide better reliability. There's also mention of the need to potentially build a custom image for AWS SageMaker if specific frameworks like VLLM are required.

- **AttributeError in RAPTOR PACK**: A user faced an `AttributeError` concerning the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'context_window'` while working with **RAPTOR PACK**. This error was discussed in the context of different imports from **Langchain** and **Llamaindex** and whether there was an alternative way to address the issue without making production changes.
- **Embedding API Response Issues**: There was a conversation about a custom **Embedding API** returning a `ValidationError` when attempting to embed documents using RAPTOR pack. Issues with the embedding function type and troubleshooting steps, like ensuring the response from the embedding API is as expected, were discussed.
- **Custom LLM Class Challenges**: The dialogue included a discussion about an AttributeError problem arising due to potential import conflicts between Langchain and LlamaIndex packages. Users shared code and suggested potential adjustments to resolve these issues, including wrapping the Langchain imported LLM to use it with LlamaIndex's RAPTOR pack.
- **PDF Chunking for Embeddings**: A user inquired about strategies for processing PDFs to generate long-context text chunks suitable for embeddings. There was a recommendation to manually combine smaller chunks into larger ones despite the default behavior of the PDF splitter to do single-page splits.
- **IngestionPipeline Query Concern**: Queries about the IngestionPipeline were raised particularly when using multiple transformations like **MarkdownNodeParser** and **SentenceSplitter** that seemed to interfere with the preservation of the original document's ID in the vector store post embedding. There was a suggestion to ensure consistent document IDs are used across input documents to facilitate deduplication.
