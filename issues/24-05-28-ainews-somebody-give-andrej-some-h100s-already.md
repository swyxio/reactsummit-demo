<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**C+CUDA is all you need.**

> AI News for 5/27/2024-5/28/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**382** channels, and **4432** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **521 minutes**.

Five years ago, OpenAI spawned its first controversy with GPT-2 being called ["too dangerous to release"](https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/openai-gpt2-text-generating-algorithm-ai-dangerous.html).

Today, with help from [FineWeb (released last month)](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-fineweb-15t-tokens-of-commoncrawl/), you can [train a tiny GPT-2 in 90 minutes and $20 in 8xA100 server time](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/481). It is already working ([kinda](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1795525191596138926)) for [the 350M version](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40504950), and Andrej estimates that the full 1.6B model will take 1 week and $2.5k.

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/28a220bf-db6e-4a67-b5ea-6738bfb86771.png?w=960&fit=max) 

And incredible accomplishment in 7 weeks of work from scratch, though at this point the repo is 75.8% CUDA, stretching the name of "llm.c".

Andrej also answered some questions on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40502090) and on [Twitter](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1795484547267834137). one of the most interesting replies: 

**Q: How large is the set of binaries needed to do this training job? The current pytorch + CUDA ecosystem is so incredibly gigantic and manipulating those container images is painful because they are so large. I was hopeful that this would be the beginnings of a much smaller training/fine-tuning stack?**

**A: That is 100% my intention and hope and I think we are very close to deleting all of that.**

It would be cheaper and faster if [more H100s were available](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1795493747205238916). Somebody help a newly GPU poor out?

- **Python function for DataFrame to JSONL conversion shared**: A user shared code for converting a DataFrame to JSONL format, suggesting it as a simple and effective solution. The code iterates over DataFrame rows, converts each row to a dictionary, and writes it to a file as a JSON line.

- **Debate on load_in_8bit impacts on training**: Users discussed whether using `load_in_8bit=True` affects training beyond reducing GPU VRAM usage. Observations included better gradient behavior with `load_in_8bit=False` and technical details on quantization and precision during training.

- **Issues with Qwen tokenizer**: There's an ongoing problem with the QwenCode1.5 tokenizer configuration being incorrect. The proposed solution is to switch to Qwen2Tokenizer, but validation or insights from Qwen are pending.

- **Context window length concerns**: A user raised concerns about prompts exceeding the model’s context window length, noting potential exceptions or performance issues. They found success with the "rope_scaling" parameter and mentioned a model supporting longer context windows, like the [Llama-3 8B Gradient Instruct](https://huggingface.co/gradientai/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-1048k).

- **Addressing token_type_ids in tokenizers**: A critical issue was identified with the default PreTrainedTokenizer class emitting `token_type_ids`, which some model classes do not handle. The correct implementation should iterate over possible vectors specified in `model_input_names` when adjusting sizes, as discussed with references to [HuggingFace code](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py#L1562).

- **Using vision with OpenAI API in LM Studio clarified**: To integrate vision capabilities in LM Studio, use a model like **LLaVA**, set it up on a server, and utilize the vision Python template. *"Just get a model that has vision like llava. Load it on to a server. And copy paste the vision python template."*
  
- **MLX/EXL2 loading faster on Apple's M1 Max**: **MLX and EXL2 models load significantly faster** than GGUF on Apple's M1 Max, taking around 5 seconds for L3 8bit, and 29 seconds for GGUF Q8. *"MLX/EXL2 are much faster than GGUF's. mainly cause the inference engine is different."*

- **Using RAG with Local LLMs**: LM Studio does not support direct interaction with PDFs or Ebooks; however, running a server via LM Studio and using [AnythingLLM](https://community.amd.com/t5/ai/how-to-enable-rag-retrieval-augmented-generation-on-an-amd-ryzen/ba-p/670670) can set up Retrieval Augmented Generation. *"start a server through LM Studio's Local Server tab and then run AnythingLLM."*

- **Fine-tuning not supported in LM Studio**: **LM Studio does not support fine-tuning**, but fine-tuning can be done using other tools like [MLX on Mac with Apple Silicon](https://apeatling.com/articles/simple-guide-to-local-llm-fine-tuning-on-a-mac-with-mlx/). *"Training models is way more resource intensive than running models + the inference engine (llama.cpp doesn't support finetuning)."*

- **Function calling in LM Studio not supported**: **LM Studio and similar llama.cpp-based APIs do not support function calling**. *"function calling isn't supported in the API."*
