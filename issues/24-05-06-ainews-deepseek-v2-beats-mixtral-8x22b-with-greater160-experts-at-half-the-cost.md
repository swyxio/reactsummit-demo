[DeepSeek V2](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2) punches a hole in the [Mistral Convex Hull from last month](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-mixtral-8x22b-instruct-defines-frontier/):

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/bcf759e8-0ca7-4ccd-a901-6289aedd96ea.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Information on dataset is extremely light; all they say is it's 8B tokens (4x more than [DeepSeek v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02954)) with about 12% more Chinese than English. 

[Snowflake Arctic](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-snowflake/) was the last very large MoE model with the highest number of experts (128) we'd seen in the wild; DeepSeek v2 now sets a new high water mark scaling up what was already successful with DeepSeekMOE, but also introducing a new attention variant called Multi-Head Latent Attention.

These result in much faster inference by caching compressed KVs ("reducing KV cache by 93.3%").

The paper details other minor tricks they find useful.

DeepSeek is putting their money where their mouth is - they are [offering token inference on their platform for $0.28 per million tokens](https://twitter.com/deepseek_ai/status/1787478994478321872) about half of the lowest prices seen in the [Mixtral Price War of Dec 2023](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1744467383090372743).

**Unsloth AI (Daniel Han) ▷ #[help](https://discord.com/channels/1179035537009545276/1179777624986357780/1235848585611051049)** (1215 messages🔥🔥🔥): 

- **Llama3 GGUF Conversion Issues Pinned Down**: Users found that GGUF conversion for Llama3 models using llama.cpp fails, resulting in altered or lost training data with no clear pattern of loss, regardless of using FP16 or FP32 conversion methods. These abnormalities occur even in F32, proving the issue is not tied to precision loss.
- **Possible Regex Mismatch for New Lines**: The problem may link to a regex library issue where `\n` sequences are improperly tokenized, potentially due to different regex library behaviors. The suggested fix modifies the tokenizer.json regex pattern for more compatibility across regex libraries, but concerns remain about the impact on different '\n' lengths.
- **Issues Exist Beyond GGUF**: Similar inference issues were found with AWQ in applications like ooba, pointing towards tokenizer or tokenization issues beyond just GGUF formatting. Unsloth's inference function seems to perform well, hinting at problems possibly specific to llama.cpp.
- **Multiple Platforms Impacted**: Platforms dependent on llama.cpp like ollama, and lm studio also face related bugs, with tokenization problems reported across different interfaces and potentially affecting a wide range of users and applications.
- **Community Cooperation Towards Solutions**: User contributions, including regex modifications, are being discussed and tested to provide temporary fixes for the gguf conversion troubles, with a focus on narrowing down whether issues are specific to the Unsloth fine-tuning process or the llama.cpp tokenization method.

**CUDA MODE ▷ #[cuda](https://discord.com/channels/1189498204333543425/1189607726595194971/1235860230395400202)** (64 messages🔥🔥): 

- **Installing Custom PyTorch/CUDA Extensions**: A member asked for a cleaner method of installing custom PyTorch/CUDA extensions within a `setup.py` file. They referenced issues with logging and system compatibility using the command line. Discussion referenced three GitHub pull requests and a specific section of a `setup.py` from the PyTorch/AO repo as examples: [PR#135](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/pull/135), [PR#186](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/pull/186), [PR#176](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/pull/176), and [pytorch/ao setup.py sample](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/blob/0ba0006eb704dea33becec82b3f34512fe8a6dff/setup.py#L35-L78).

- **TorchServe GPU Configuration Clarifications**: A member needed clarification on performance settings mentioned during a presentation, specifically regarding `torch.set_num_threads`. A [blog post](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchserve_with_ipex.html) was shared for details on `torch.set_num_threads`. Further clarification pointed out incorrect documentation that should read higher latency with larger batch size and how to approach adjusting worker numbers for optimising throughput and latency.

- **Atomic Operations in CUDA**: Discussion about whether a certain CUDA code snippet using `reinterpret_cast` is atomic. It was confirmed that the code does perform atomically but has undefined behavior according to the C++ standard. The correct, standard-compliant method should use `std::bit_cast`.

- **Performance of Numba-CUDA vs. CUDA-C**: An inquiry was made comparing the performance of numba-CUDA and CUDA-C with the numba-CUDA version running slower. Through sharing performance profiles and examining pTX files, it was discovered that the numba version includes memory safety checks which may slow down execution.

- **Interest in CUTLASS and Stream-K Scheduling Technique**: A member expressed interest in having a future discussion or lecture on the stream-K scheduling technique employed in CUTLASS for GEMM. While there was openness to the suggestion, it was noted that stream-K could fit as a short subsection in another talk, particularly because explaining the CUTLASS 2.0 API could be extensive.

- **CUDA Compiling Quirks**: Compilers like `nvcc 11.5` throw errors for operations in bfloat16 on older GPUs; functions like `__ldcs` and `__stcd` are undefined, and operations like `__bfloat1622float2` cause issues. A [fix is proposed](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/353) to handle bfloat16 arithmetic manually to support older cards and toolkits.
- **Multi-GPU Training Hangs**: Recent commits to the master branch caused multi-GPU training to hang, as reported in [Issue #369](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/issues/369). A [separate working branch](https://github.com/PeterZhizhin/llm.c/branch/nccl) maintains functional multi-GPU training, and merging this while diagnosing the issue on the master branch is under consideration.
- **Performance and Refactoring Updates**: A PR has been merged that brings a small performance gain by introducing a new [optimized matmul_bias kernel](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/343), and subsequent contributions aim to further enhance performance through kernel fusions and [CUDA stream adjustments](https://github.com/ademeure/llm.c/pull/2).
- **Correctness in Overlapping NCCL and Compute**: An attempt to overlap NCCL and backwards compute in multi-GPU training shows improved iteration times, from 225ms down to 193ms ([PR #361](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/361)). Correctness verification and testing remain essential while optimizing multi-GPU logic.
- **Nsight Systems Profiling**: Efforts to improve profiling include using Nvidia's Nsight Systems for better visualization and understanding the intricacies of application performance on GPUs. This includes creating a tutorial to help others set up and use Nsight Systems to analyze and optimize CUDA programs.

- **NuMojo Update Rockets Ahead**: [NuMojo](https://github.com/MadAlex1997/NuMojo), previously Mojo-Arrays, is back in active development, updated to Mojo version 24.3. The library, focused on building functions around the standard library tensor, is now significantly faster, offering a performance boost of 6x to 20x compared to numpy.

- **Mimage Library for Mojo Image Parsing**: A new library called [Mimage](https://github.com/fnands/mimage) for image parsing in Mojo has been introduced, with support for simple 8-bit RGB PNGs. There's an ongoing community discussion on whether to adopt a PIL-style Image class or an ND array representation for images.

- **Basalt Development Milestones**: The [Basalt project](https://github.com/basalt-org/basalt) has celebrated reaching 200 stars, released new documentation at [Basalt Docs](https://basalt-docs.vercel.app/), and announced updates for Mojo 24.3. These updates include experimental ONNX model import/export, dynamic operation support, and a variety of enhancements and bug fixes.

- **Prototype for Struct Composability in Mojo**: The lsx library for HTML generation in Mojo has seen a new prototype for struct composability shared at [GitHub lsx](https://github.com/rd4com/lsx/tree/main/struct%20composability%20prototype), aiming for full compatibility with lsx and better handling of UnsafePointers.

- **MinBPE Port and Performance Insights**: A Mojo port of Andrej Karpathy’s minbpe project [minbpe.mojo](https://github.com/dorjeduck/minbpe.mojo) has been posted, highlighting the challenges of porting from Python and the absence of inheritance in Mojo. The Mojo version is about three times faster than the Python original, with noticeable performance gains after switching to a more efficient dictionary implementation.

- **Building with Mojo and Parameters**: A new tutorial was shared on using parameters to build a Mojo app, enhancing workflows and integrating custom constraints. The tutorial is available at [GitHub - Tutorial on parameters in Mojo](https://github.com/rd4com/mojo-learning/blob/main/tutorials/use-parameters-to-create-or-integrate-workflow.md).

- **Syntax Highlighting Tip**: In response to the tutorial on Mojo parameters, a suggestion was made to improve the readability of the code using proper syntax highlighting, by using triple backticks with the term "mojo" in markdown files.

- **Parsing PNGs in Mojo Explored**: A blog post about parsing PNGs using Mojo was shared, along with the launch of a library named *mimage* for reading images in Mojo. Both the [blog post](https://fnands.com/mojo-png-parsing/) and the [mimage library](https://github.com/fnands/mimage) are accessible online.

- **Community Positive Feedback**: The blog post on PNG parsing received positive feedback from the community, with peers expressing admiration for the effort.

- **RSS Feed Needs a Fix**: The same blog post author acknowledged the need to fix the RSS feed issue on their site after a community member expressed interest in subscribing to future articles.

- **80 column debate heats up**: Discord participants discussed the need to move beyond the [80-column convention](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4651012/why-is-the-default-terminal-width-80-characters), historical for punched cards and monitors. Some members expressed a preference for 100 columns, stating it would still allow multiple file views side-by-side.

- **Nightly Mojo compiler update**: A new [nightly release of the Mojo compiler](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2498/files) was announced, with details on the recent changes available in the provided links. Users are encouraged to update with `modular update nightly/mojo`.

- **Register passable types on the chopping block**: Discussion emerged around the evolution of the "register passable" concept in Mojo, with an aim to phase out types like `OptionalReg` in favor of all-encompassing types like `Optional` and leaning towards traits to indicate register passability.

- **The math module's status addressed**: Confirmation that the math module has not disappeared; it's yet to be open-sourced, resulting in references to it being removed from the open-sourced part of the stdlib.

- **Pre-commit hook issue filed**: An [issue with the "check-license" pre-commit hook](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/2528#issuecomment-2094837006) was reported, where it couldn't find the stdlib, leading to a discussion and an eventual open issue for the intermittent problem.
