> `Weights and Biases vs MLflow, Recording Experimentation Results, State of Classical Machine Learning, 1-bit Large Language Models` 


- **Weights and Biases is Cloud-Based, MLflow is Self-Hosted**: Weights and Biases (WandB) functions as a hosted service, making it less suitable for some users, whereas **MLflow** offers a self-hosting option.
   - Both tools perform effectively for managing machine learning experiments.
- **Experimentation Results Stored in Databases**: In the worst case, experimentation results can be recorded into a **Postgres** or **Clickhouse** database.
   - This provides a fallback method for keeping track of experimental data.
- **Discussion on the State of Classical ML**: A member raised concerns over whether classical machine learning is being overshadowed by LLM applications.
   - Questions arose about the future of **recommender systems**, **time series**, and **clustering** problems in this evolving landscape.
- **BitNet: Pioneering 1-bit LLMs**: Recent developments, such as **BitNet**, introduce **1-bit Large Language Models** (LLMs) that efficiently match full-precision models in performance metrics while being cost-effective.
   - These models use ternary weights and create new opportunities for hardware optimization tailored for low-bit representations.
