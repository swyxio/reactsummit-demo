<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->Happy Friday. 3 new models are the talk of the town today:

- Mistral's new [8x7B MoE model](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38570537) (aka "Mixtral") - a classical attention model, done well. Andrej's recap [here](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1733181701361451130).
- [Mamba models](https://twitter.com/tri_dao/status/1731728602230890895), a range  of models up to 3B by (former guest) [Tri Dao of Together](https://www.latent.space/p/flashattention)
- [StripedHyena 7B](https://fxtwitter.com/omarsar0/status/1733223272412594501) - a descendant of the subquadratic attention replacement [Hyena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866) out of Stanford's Hazy Research lab released earlier this year, that is finally competitive with Llama-2, Yi, and Mistral 7B.

This is all very substantial and shows what happens when you ship model weights instead of heavily edited marketing videos.
