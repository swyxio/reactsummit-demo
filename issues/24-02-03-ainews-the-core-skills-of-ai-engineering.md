We really tried to avoid featuring Latent Space twice in a row, but Eugene Yan [kicked off a discussion on AI Engineering](https://twitter.com/eugeneyan/status/1753445305545298314):

Which [resulted in](https://discord.com/channels/822583790773862470/1075282825051385876/1203011101193801728) the longest ever thread on the topic:

The central confusion is the high degree of overlap between what are traditionally software engineer skills and data scientist skills, but also what software engineers struggle with when dealing with probabilistic, data-driven systems. Do they need to be reading papers? Do they need to write CUDA kernels?

Some mental models were created:

- **Request for Implicit Text Modification**: `@novumclassicum` inquired about a method to have GPT **modify text for text-to-speech** without displaying the changes on-screen. They seek to provide an output-ready submission after the GPT performs word replacements in memory.

- **Injecting Personality into AI Responses**: `@_fresnic` looked for advice on making API responses reflect a certain **personality**. They've noted some success with prompting GPT to *“talk like someone who is [personality...]"*.

- **Reducing Repetitive Server Communication Permissions**: `@novumclassicum` asked for a solution to prevent their **custom GPT** from repeatedly asking users for server communication permissions after the initial consent.

- **Challenges in Sustaining Multi-Character Dialogues**: `@stealth2077` sought tips for generating **realistic conversations** between multiple characters. They struggle to get the AI to produce more than three lines of dialogue before it summarizes the conversation.

- **Desire for Detailed Play-by-play Character Interactions**: Further emphasizing the issue, `@stealth2077` expressed a desire for the AI to generate a full dialogue with every line instead of summarizing.

- **Seeking Stealth Text Processing Tips**: `@novumclassicum` is looking for a way to have GPT perform text modifications invisibly before submission, specifically for a text-to-speech application. The desired outcome is for the GPT to replace words in memory and submit the text without displaying the modifications to the user, but they’re uncertain about the instructions required to achieve this.

- **Personal Touch in API Responses**: `@_fresnic` experimented with giving an AI via the API a personality, starting with a name and interests to be included in the responses. They discovered that phrasing like "talk like someone who is [personality...]" seemed to improve the AI's response.

- **One-Click Connection Conundrum**: `@novumclassicum` inquires about a way to prevent a custom GPT from repeatedly asking for permission to communicate with an outside server after the first approval. They're looking to replicate the feature where the popup will not trigger after the initial click.

- **Generating Those Character Dialogues**: `@stealth2077` seeks advice on generating realistic and extensive discussions between characters in a narrative. They've found that the AI tends to summarize conversations after three lines instead of continuing with the dialogue.

- **Dialogue Expansion Desired**: Continuing the topic, `@stealth2077` expresses difficulty in getting more than a few lines of dialogue before the AI switches to summarization. They wish for it to generate every single line of the conversation.

- **Dual GPU Dilemma**: User `@merpdragon` experiences issues with models failing to load or performing very slowly on a dual GPU setup, consisting of an RTX 3070 and a GTX 1060, despite having 80GB of RAM. `@heyitsyorkie` and `@.ben.com` discuss shared memory problems and VRAM limitations, hinting that the GTX 1060 may not be making a significant contribution to performance.
  
- **Nvidia Control Panel Tip**: `@.ben.com` shares that NVIDIA's control panel has a setting to disable shared memory, potentially helping with `@merpdragon`'s issue.

- **Considering Hardware Upgrade for LLMs**: `@heyitsyorkie` advises that for speed improvements with 70b models, one should consider upgrading to dual RTX 3090 GPUs, as 3070 would still run slow.

- **Big Language Models and VRAM Bound Performance**: `@.ben.com` and `@rugg0064` shed light on how VRAM is a crucial factor in running LLMs, with performance being memory-bound rather than compute-bound in many scenarios.

- **Anticipating a New LLM Machine Setup**: User `@wildcat_aurora` is anticipating setting up a machine with 4 P40 GPUs and considers using Ubuntu for better performance in running 70b models, while `@kujila` enquires about building a similar setup using last-gen AMD motherboards and eBay GPUs.

- **Benchmarking CPUs with LM Studio**: `@goldensun3ds` plans to benchmark different CPUs against each other using LM Studio, questioning the ideal GPU layer settings and considering using Task Manager's VRAM usage as a gauge, with `@rugg0064` confirming that approach. `@.ben.com` points out that Core counts will have less impact due to memory bottlenecks, and parameters like Top P do not affect inference performance.

- **Diffusers 0.26.0 Takes Off**: User `@sayakpaul` announced the release of **Diffusers 0.26.0**, featuring two new video models, multi IP-adapter inference, and more, with a cheeky weekend release remark. Full release notes can be found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/releases/tag/v0.26.0).

- **Troubleshooting in Action**: User `@meatfucker` reported issues with the example code from the new release, experiencing only noisy gifs as output when attempting to run the video pipeline examples on Windows.

- **A Loud Warning and the Quest for Answers**: During troubleshooting, `@meatfucker` shared a warning related to `flash attention` received in the console but was initially unsure of its impact on the output quality.

- **Detective Work Pays Off**: With some investigation, `@meatfucker` discovered the root cause of the issue, noting that the example code mistakenly set the number of inference steps to 1, which likely led to the poor output.

- **A Matter of Steps and Size**: `@meatfucker` pointed out that both the inference steps and decode size were set to ineffective values (1), which differ from the more appropriate defaults (50 inference steps) indicated in the official diffusers documentation, suggesting it might be a typo in the release notes.

- **Shared Memory in Numba Speed Explained**: `@mishakeyvalue` inquired about the speed difference when using **shared memory** compared to global reads/writes in GPU computing with Numba. [Siboehm's article](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM) was shared by `@stefangliga`, featuring optimizations in CUDA matrix multiplication and performance characteristics like memory access coalescing and shared memory caching, along with links to relevant GitHub repos for further exploration.

- **Kernel Code Snippet Error Handling**: `@ashpun` faced a `RuntimeError` related to a failed `inline_ext` build in CUDA kernel coding. Following a discussion asking for the full error details, `@marksaroufim` resolved the issue, identifying a missing brace (`}`) in the kernel code.

- **Troubleshooting ImportError in CUDA Coding**: After resolving one issue, `@ashpun` encountered an ImportError indicating a missing `GLIBCXX_3.4.32` version, despite being present on the system. `@marksaroufim` suggested running `conda update --all` and potentially setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` correctly to address the library path issue.
