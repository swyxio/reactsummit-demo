> `Threadgroup/Grid Sizes, BEAM Search Explanation, Shared Output Buffers in JIT, Manual Upcasting for Loops` 


- **Threadgroup/Grid Sizes can be changed in OptOps**: A user inquired whether the threadgroup/grid sizes can be altered during graph rewrite optimizations in `uopgraph.py`. George Hotz replied that they can be modified, specifically in **OptOps** within **kernel.py**.
- **Explained BEAM Search and Kernel Optimization Options**: A user shared a post on [BEAM Search](https://github.com/mesozoic-egg/tinygrad-notes/blob/main/20241203_beam.md) along with an explanation of the kernel optimization options. The post serves as a resource for understanding these concepts in **tinygrad**.
- **JIT Functions Reuse Output Buffers**: A note about JIT functions revealed that after the first call, jitted functions reuse the same output buffer, which may overwrite previous results. To preserve results, it's necessary to use `.clone().realize()` after each call.
- **Manual Upcasting for Large Loops**: A user asked about the possibility of manually forcing upcasting for a large loop. The conversation continues with no direct answer provided.
