> - `Research collaboration feedback`
> - `Sparse encoding in SAEs`
> - `Vision embedding vs vision token`
> - `Training Input Statistics Adjustment` 


- **NaN weights derail embedding training**: A user reported that their embedding weights go to **NaN** just a few steps into training, despite having a normal range initially. Various members suggested checking gradients and loss components that might be rounding to zero, which pointed to a **data-dependent decay term** as the probable cause.
   - *Lightning's detect_anomaly=True setting proved useful for debugging*, tracking the issue to the decay term based on gradient analysis.
- **Seeking research feedback from the community**: A PhD student sought feedback on research project ideas related to compression using diffusion models, asking where to post. Members suggested posting in the general channel or a designated space for low-pressure discussions.
   - Another member suggested regularizing losses on network inputs to maintain stability, while emphasizing the need to clarify assumptions in discussions regarding SAEs.
- **Discussion on sparse encoding in SAEs**: A member clarified that a reconstruction error loss term should accompany a sparsity-focused loss in their SAE approach. Additional losses can prevent deviations from expected distributions during training, even when inputs are fixed.
   - Participants highlighted potential misunderstandings about the role of the LLM in SAEs, stressing that statistics from frozen networks can provide essential context for the encoding process.
- **Exploring vision embeddings versus tokens**: A user raised questions about the trade-offs between using **vision embedding** and **vision token** approaches for modeling. The community acknowledged the difference but noted a lack of clarity on the specific advantages of each technique.

- **Exploring Multi-Token Prediction**: There was a discussion on the effectiveness of multi-token prediction (MTP) for reasoning and planning tasks, with some members questioning its utility for smaller models.
   - It was mentioned that published studies have yet to mitigate concerns around MTP's performance on smaller architectures.
- **Finite Scalar Quantization Introduced**: FSQ was highlighted as a promising alternative to vector quantization (VQ) in VQ-VAEs, potentially improving codebook utilization and model efficiency.
   - Members noted the simplicity of FSQ while still achieving competitive metrics, making it an attractive option for further exploration.
- **Symmetry in Neural Networks Explored**: A new paper discusses the negative impact of symmetry in loss functions, which can lead to low-capacity states, and proposes a method to mitigate this issue.
   - Concerns were raised about the implementation costs and effectiveness of applying this new loss function across different models.

> - `Measuring Consistency in Multiple Choice Questions` 


- **Introducing Word Game Bench for Language Models**: A new benchmark called **Word Game Bench** has been developed for evaluating language models on word puzzle games, particularly **Wordle** and **Connections**.
   - No model currently scores above **50%** average win rate, and the benchmark is designed to test models through interaction and feedback rather than static responses.
- **Challenges in Measuring Consistency**: A member is attempting to compare responses for multiple choice questions to measure consistency when prompts vary slightly, using an extended dataset for the same question across different prompts.
   - Suggestions include creating datasets that represent desired comparisons using functions like `doc_to_target` or `doc_to_text`, albeit with the needed effort for each model.
