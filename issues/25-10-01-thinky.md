title: 'Thinking Machines'' Tinker: LoRA based LLM fine-tuning API'
date: '2025-10-01T05:44:39.731046Z'
description: >-
  **Thinking Machines** recently raised **$2 billion** without shipping a
  product until now, launching their first product **Tinker**, a managed service
  API for fine-tuning large and mixture-of-experts models like
  **Qwen-235B-A22B** using **LoRA** for cost-efficient training. The Tinker API
  offers low-level primitives for post-training methods and is supported by an
  open-source **Tinker Cookbook** library. Influential AI figures like **Andrej
  Karpathy** and **Lilian Weng** praised its design for reducing complexity and
  boosting research productivity. Meanwhile, **OpenAI** launched **Sora 2**, a
  video+audio model integrated into their consumer social app, sparking viral
  engagement and concerns over misuse and content moderation. Sam Altman
  emphasized the product's dual focus on delight and revenue alongside AGI
  research.

The timing is oddly coincidental indeed:

- 5 days ago [**The Information called out Thinking Machines**](https://archive.ph/eq4g5) for raising $2b but not shipping any product
- the same day Jeremy Bernstein publishes [Modular Manifolds](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/modular-manifolds/) (a heavily theoretical grounding on optimizers and constraints for training stability), and 3 days later John Schulman writes [LoRA Without Regret](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/lora/) (an empirical endorsement of [the original 2021 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) validating its performance to full finetuning [similar to Biderman et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09673) when done right)
- today, Thinky ships its first product, [Tinker.](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/announcing-tinker/)

Per their [landing page](https://thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/):

Tinker lets you fine-tune a short list of large and small open-weight models, including large mixture-of-experts models such as Qwen-235B-A22B. Switching from a small model to a large one is as simple as changing a single string in your Python code.

Tinker is a managed service that runs on our internal clusters and training infrastructure. We handle scheduling, resource allocation, and failure recovery. This allows you to get small or large runs started immediately, without worrying about managing infrastructure. We use LoRA so that we can share the same pool of compute between multiple training runs, lowering costs.

Tinker’s API gives you low-level primitives like `forward_backward` and `sample`, which can be used to express most common post-training methods. Even so, achieving good results requires getting many details right. That’s why we’re releasing an open-source library, the [Tinker Cookbook](http://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker-cookbook), with modern implementations of post-training methods that run on top of the Tinker API.

![](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/dJrzO1SZwRjgJrV)

This small API surface area seems a very well received abstraction - as Andrej [says](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1973468610917179630), "*You retain 90% of algorithmic creative control (usually related to data, loss function, the algorithm) while tinker handles the hard parts that you usually want to touch much less often (infra, forward/backward of the LLM itself, distributed training), meaning you can do these at well below <<10% of typical complexity involved.*"

Lilian (biased) [agrees](https://x.com/lilianweng/status/1973455232341516731): "*Providing high quality research tooling is one of the most effective ways to improve research productivity of the wider community and Tinker API is one step towards our mission there.*"

There's a waitlist, and mind the [terms of service](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45444869). But one does hope that this first product is just a harbinger of much larger, ambitious things...

# AI Twitter Recap

**OpenAI’s Sora 2 app: product, platform effects, and early stress tests**

- Sora 2 shipped as a video+audio model inside OpenAI’s first consumer social app, igniting massive engagement and debate. The feed and “cameo” feature landed instantly as an “AI slop machine” for some creators ([ostr](https://twitter.com/ostrisai/status/1973210333532811419)), with viral reactions noting it can “out‑slop” incumbent platforms ([@skirano](https://twitter.com/skirano/status/1973248497853018168)). Others flagged the obvious misuse potential ([@TheStalwart](https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1973372434133950665)), “recursive jailbreak” risks ([@fabianstelzer](https://twitter.com/fabianstelzer/status/1973300086949253410)), and engagement-farming patterns like “double-tap for emoji” videos flooding the feed ([@Teknium1](https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1973347911980454274); [@ostrisai](https://twitter.com/ostrisai/status/1973476918285709398)). OpenAI is scaling invites and tempering daily gen limits as usage ramps ([@billpeeb](https://twitter.com/billpeeb/status/1973260687553208344)).
    
    Quality is striking but inconsistent on compositional/grounded reasoning tests (e.g., counting fingers/letters) ([@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1973358605752738023); [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1973414141370179876)). Sam Altman acknowledged the product is partly about delight and revenue while the company focuses research on AGI/agents (“reality is nuanced”) ([@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1973381552621887706)), later reflecting on the surreal experience of a feed full of himself ([@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1973377760262295959)). Strategic take: OpenAI is turning frontier models into sticky apps (ChatGPT, Codex, now Sora), building moats beyond raw model quality ([@Yuchenj_UW](https://twitter.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/1973435314195800392)).
    

**DeepSeek V3.2 and DSA: cheaper long context at scale, day-0 ecosystem support**

- DeepSeek V3.2 Exp introduces DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA): each token attends to ~2048 tokens via a noncontiguous sliding window, making decode memory/FLOPs effectively O(2048). Third-party notes call out the indexing pipeline and a Hadamard transform over Q/K in the indexer ([@nrehiew_](https://twitter.com/nrehiew_/status/1973193918662713510)). Pricing dropped >50% (inputs) and 75% (outputs), with MIT licensing and the same 671B total/37B active MoE footprint as V3/R1 ([@ArtificialAnlys](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1973230103854456993)). Benchmarks show parity with V3.1 in both reasoning and long-context tasks and slightly improved token efficiency ([@ArtificialAnlys](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1973230103854456993)).
    
    Infra momentum: vLLM had day‑0 support with NVIDIA’s help; Blackwell is now “the go‑to release platform for new MoEs” ([@vllm_project](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/1973238773090754735); [@TheZachMueller](https://twitter.com/TheZachMueller/status/1973197330754183433)). Analysts argue DSA effectively “unlocks 1M contexts” and signals a broader attention-efficiency wave, though potential tradeoffs below ~2K context are worth watching ([@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1973209017603465324); [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1973271647680602565)). Community sentiment: the step-change in cost per token “still isn’t priced in” ([@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1973247682664866137)).
    

**Claude Sonnet 4.5: coding/agent upgrades and availability tweaks**

- Teams report faster, shorter chains and higher hit rates on real workflows vs Sonnet 4.0/Opus, especially in coding agents and Claude Code-style loops: fewer retries and less waiting on toolchains ([@augmentcode](https://twitter.com/augmentcode/status/1973431992097308983); [@iannuttall](https://twitter.com/iannuttall/status/1973460871574856019)). Claude Code’s own team switched their daily driver to Sonnet 4.5 and reset some Opus limits; Anthropic also reset rate limits across paid users to let people try 4.5 ([@_catwu](https://twitter.com/_catwu/status/1973524717899489340); [@alexalbert__](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1973522280195170337)).
    
    Not universal: some pipelines still favor GPT‑4o/5 or see regressions on specific tasks ([@imjaredz](https://twitter.com/imjaredz/status/1973178865104331116); [@Teknium1](https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1973476714924876218)). Early “thinking/alignment” observations highlight better user‑intent modeling in multi‑turn setups ([@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1973264029599842380)). Sonnet 4.5 Thinking 32k is live in community evals (Arena, OpenHands) ([@arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/1973491519857549618); [@allhands_ai](https://twitter.com/allhands_ai/status/1973485506714652998)).
    

**Zhipu’s GLM‑4.6: efficiency-first release, agent-centric improvements**

- GLM‑4.6 prioritizes token efficiency and response speed over fireworks. A widely read Chinese review reports ~5% capability bump vs 4.5, large cuts in “thinking” tokens (e.g., 16K→9K in reasoning), faster responses (~35s avg), and more stable instruction following; weakness noted on very complex tasks and some base‑model code syntax errors ([Zhihu summary via @ZhihuFrontier](https://twitter.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/1973447038818762841)). Hands-on: strong front-end/agentic behaviors; Python unchanged in limited tests ([@karminski3](https://twitter.com/karminski3/status/1973353334796140716)).
    
    Economics: GLM‑4.6 now in Kilo Code with a claimed 48.6% win rate vs Claude Sonnet 4.5 on internal tasks, 200K context, and aggressive pricing at $0.60/$2.20 per 1M tokens ([@kilocode](https://twitter.com/kilocode/status/1973396250729877904)). No 4.6‑Air planned; Zhipu hinted at possibly releasing a smaller MoE later ([@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1973288764870164852)).
    

**Post-training infrastructure steps up: Thinking Machines’ Tinker**

- Tinker exposes low‑level, researcher‑friendly post‑training primitives (forward_backward, sample, optim_step) with managed distributed GPUs, supporting SFT, RL (PPO/GRPO), LoRA, multi‑turn/async RL, and custom losses—moving fine‑tuning/RL from enterprise “upload data, we do the rest” toward retaining algorithmic control while outsourcing infra. Endorsements from across the stack:
    - High‑profile support and usage reports from frontier researchers and builders ([@johnschulman2](https://twitter.com/johnschulman2/status/1973450054238347314); [@karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1973468610917179630); [@robertnishihara](https://twitter.com/robertnishihara/status/1973455582603649430); [@pcmoritz](https://twitter.com/pcmoritz/status/1973456462346424641); [@lilianweng](https://twitter.com/lilianweng/status/1973455232341516731)).
    - Early results: Princeton’s Goedel team matched ~81 pass@32 on MiniF2F using LoRA with 20% of SFT data; Redwood is exploring long‑context RL for control‑sensitive behaviors; others prototyped text‑to‑SQL with reward environments ([@chijinML](https://twitter.com/chijinML/status/1973451597393883451); [@ejcgan](https://twitter.com/ejcgan/status/1973449963259699284); [@robertnishihara](https://twitter.com/robertnishihara/status/1973455582603649430)).
    - Why now: MoE arithmetic intensity and memory pressure push serious training/FT beyond single‑node hobbyist rigs; shared infra that batches requests and handles multinode assets lowers the barrier ([@cHHillee](https://twitter.com/cHHillee/status/1973469947889422539)).
        
        Expect follow‑on integrations (Ray, eval/RM stacks) and a de facto standard, API‑like interface for training akin to inference APIs ([@tyler_griggs_](https://twitter.com/tyler_griggs_/status/1973450947218252224)).
        

**Research and systems highlights**

- Optimizers and dynamics: “Central flows” provide a theoretical tool explaining why DL optimizers run at the edge of stability with accurate quantitative predictions on real NNs ([@deepcohen](https://twitter.com/deepcohen/status/1973191790602887544)). On AdamW, new asymptotics for weight RMS ([@Jianlin_S](https://twitter.com/Jianlin_S/status/1973254893579411952)).
- Robotics via retargeting and minimal RL: OmniRetarget (Amazon FAR) generates high‑quality interaction‑preserving humanoid motions enabling agile long‑horizon skills with only proprioception and a small reward/DR set ([@pabbeel](https://twitter.com/pabbeel/status/1973426729952956652); [project](https://twitter.com/zhenkirito123/status/1973417906412331361)). Independent work shows real‑world humanoid residual RL improving BC policies within ~15–75 minutes of interaction ([@larsankile](https://twitter.com/larsankile/status/1973191635904373243)).
- Audio and evals: Liquid AI released LFM2‑Audio, a 1.5B on‑device, real‑time audio‑text model (speech-to-speech/text, TTS, classification) with open weights and 10x faster inference ([@LiquidAI_](https://twitter.com/LiquidAI_/status/1973372092230836405); [@maximelabonne](https://twitter.com/maximelabonne/status/1973372579441496514)). RTEB (MTEB update) brings private multilingual retrieval sets to reduce overfitting ([@tomaarsen](https://twitter.com/tomaarsen/status/1973413487528309204)). MENLO introduces a multilingual preference dataset and framework across 47 languages for judging native‑like response quality ([@seb_ruder](https://twitter.com/seb_ruder/status/1973412580191285640)).
- Systems: Perplexity Research details RDMA point‑to‑point to accelerate trillion‑param parameter updates to ~1.3s, using static scheduling and pipelining for distributed RL/FT ([@perplexity_ai](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1973508460814999726)).

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Alibaba Qwen 100M-ctx/10T-param Roadmap & Tencent Hunyuan Image 3.0 Teaser

- [**Alibaba just unveiled their Qwen roadmap. The ambition is staggering!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nq182d/alibaba_just_unveiled_their_qwen_roadmap_the/) (Activity: 954): **Alibaba’s Qwen roadmap image outlines an aggressive push toward a unified multimodal family with extreme scaling: context length from** `1M → 100M` **tokens, model size from ~**`1T → 10T` **parameters, test‑time compute budgets from** `64k → 1M`**, and pretraining data from** `10T → 100T` **tokens. It also highlights effectively unbounded synthetic data generation and broader agent capabilities across complexity, interaction, and learning modes.** Commenters question the practicality of a `100M` context window, anticipate future models may be closed‑source, and note that >`1T`‑parameter models are impractical to run locally without substantial hardware.
    - Claimed `100M`token context implies non-standard attention/memory. With vanilla Transformer attention (`O(L^2)` compute) and typical KV-cache scaling, even with MQA/GQA the KV memory would be on the order of terabytes (e.g., a ~7B model with MQA at ~`~16 KB/token` would need ~`~1.6 TB` KV for `100M` tokens; with full KV heads it would balloon to tens of TB). Achieving this practically would require techniques like state/compressed memory or blockwise attention (e.g., [RingAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01889), [StreamingLLM/Attention Sinks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453)), retrieval-augmented chunking, or recurrence/SSM-style architectures, not just RoPE scaling.
    - Running `>1T`parameter models locally is infeasible for dense models due to memory/throughput: at 8-bit, weights alone are `~1 TB` (4-bit: `~0.5 TB`) plus multi-terabyte KV for long contexts; tokens/sec would be low without multi-GPU NVLink-class bandwidth. The only realistic path is large MoE (e.g., `>1T` total with `2-of-64` experts) where active params per token are `~50–100B`; with 4–8 bit quantization this still requires `~40–160 GB` VRAM plus KV and fast interconnects (8–16 GPUs). In short, consumer single-GPU rigs won’t cut it; think multi-GPU servers (e.g., 8×H100/GB200) with tensor/pipeline parallelism.
- [**Tencent is teasing the world’s most powerful open-source text-to-image model, Hunyuan Image 3.0 Drops Sept 28**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nqaiaz/tencent_is_teasing_the_worlds_most_powerful/) (Activity: 225): **Tencent is teasing an open‑source text‑to‑image model, Hunyuan Image 3.0, billed as the “world’s most powerful,” with a release date of Sept 28 per the promo [image](https://i.redd.it/t8w84ihz1crf1.jpeg). No technical card, benchmarks, or architecture details are provided in the teaser; a commenter mentions a potential** `~96 GB` **VRAM requirement for inference, but this is unverified and key specs (params, training data, license) remain unknown.** Commenters are skeptical of pre‑release hype, citing a pattern where heavily teased models underperform (e.g., SD3 vs Flux, GPT‑5 hype), and note that “most powerful” is unsubstantiated without comparable open‑source baselines.
    - Hardware concerns: commenters speculate a `~96 GB VRAM` requirement for Hunyuan Image 3.0 inference, which—if accurate—would limit local use to datacenter/Prosumer GPUs (A6000/A100/H100) and be far heavier than SDXL (~8–12 GB at 1024px) or **FLUX.1-dev** (~14–24 GB) [FLUX.1-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev). This suggests a much larger transformer/diffusion backbone or high-res attention footprint, with potential throughput penalties unless optimized (e.g., TensorRT/Flash-Attn, tiled attention).
    - Skepticism about pre-release hype vs real quality: users note a pattern where heavily teased models underdeliver (e.g., **SD3** marketing vs community preference for **FLUX.1** quality) [SD3](https://stability.ai/news/introducing-stable-diffusion-3), while strong models (e.g., **Qwen** family) often “shadow drop” with solid benchmarks [Qwen org](https://huggingface.co/Qwen). They want third‑party evaluations (e.g., CLIPScore/PickScore/HPSv2, text‑faithfulness suites like GenEval) and apples‑to‑apples prompts/resolution/steps to validate any “most powerful” claims.
    - Open-source and ecosystem details matter: commenters question “most powerful open‑source” claims until licensing (“open weights” vs permissive OSS) and practical integration are clear. Immediate asks include ComfyUI node/pipeline availability [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) and head‑to‑head comparisons against recent open releases (e.g., the latest Qwen image stack), which will determine adoption in real workflows.

### 2. Fenghua No.3 DX12/Vulkan GPU & Uncensored 'Abliterated' LLM Fine-tune Outcomes

- [**China already started making CUDA and DirectX supporting GPUs, so over of monopoly of NVIDIA. The Fenghua No.3 supports latest APIs, including DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.2, and OpenGL 4.6.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nq1ia2/china_already_started_making_cuda_and_directx/) (Activity: 702): **Post claims China’s Fenghua No.3 GPU supports modern graphics APIs—DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.2, and OpenGL 4.6—and even CUDA, suggesting a potential alternative to NVIDIA’s CUDA ecosystem. Genuine CUDA compatibility on non‑NVIDIA silicon would imply a reimplemented CUDA runtime/driver or a PTX translation layer (similar in spirit to HIP/ZLUDA), but the post provides no benchmarks, driver details, or validation.** Commenters note AMD’s HIP (with projects like ZLUDA) already offers CUDA compatibility via translation, while suggesting Chinese vendors might bypass legal constraints to ship direct CUDA support. Others express skepticism pending real hardware/tests and warn about possible export/sanctions issues.
    - Technical context: **AMD’s HIP** provides source-level CUDA compatibility by renaming/ mirroring CUDA APIs (e.g., `cudaMalloc` -> `hipMalloc`) and using tools like hipify to translate CUDA code; see AMD ROCm HIP docs: https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP. Projects like **ZLUDA** aim to run CUDA apps on non-NVIDIA hardware by translating CUDA driver/runtime calls to other backends (e.g., Intel Level Zero or AMD ROCm); repo: https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA. The distinction is important: HIP requires recompilation against ROCm, while ZLUDA seeks binary/runtime compatibility—both sidestep NVIDIA’s legal/IP minefield differently, which Chinese vendors might ignore by implementing CUDA interfaces directly.
- [**IMPORTANT: Why Abliterated Models SUCK. Here is a better way to uncensor LLMs.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nq0cp9/important_why_abliterated_models_suck_here_is_a/) (Activity: 433): *OP reports that “abliteration” (weight edits to remove safety/filters) on recent MoE models like Qwen3-30B-A3B degrades logical reasoning, agentic/tool-use behavior, and increases hallucinations—often making* `30B` *abliterated models perform worse than non‑abliterated* `4–8B`*. In contrast, abliterated‑then‑finetuned models (e.g., [mradermacher/Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-erotic-i1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-erotic-i1-GGUF), tested as* `i1-Q4_K_S`*) and [mlabonne/NeuralDaredevil-8B-abliterated](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/NeuralDaredevil-8B-abliterated) (DPO‑tuned from [Meta‑Llama‑3‑8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B)) “heal” most losses while remaining uncensored. In Model Context Protocol ([MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)) tool‑calling tests, the erotic Qwen3 variant selected tools correctly more often and hallucinated less than other Qwen3-30B A3B abliterations (Huihui-* `Q4_K_M`*/*`i1-Q4_K_M`*), though still slightly worse than the original for agentic tasks.*Commenters label this effect “model healing”: unconstrained weight surgery breaks circuits; subsequent finetuning restores capabilities. Others call for non‑adult benchmarks and question abliteration’s value if a plain finetune (without abliteration) consistently matches or beats abliterated+finetune.
    - Weight editing without a guiding loss ("abliteration") is effectively unconstrained weight-space surgery and predictably degrades capabilities; commenters recommend subsequent "model healing" (supervised fine-tuning) to let the network re-learn broken feature pathways. However, practitioners report abliterated+finetune has not outperformed a clean fine-tune baseline on any task, implying direct weight manipulation mostly adds damage and extra training cost rather than gains.
    - Evaluation should go beyond NSFW-specific tasks: the Uncensored General Intelligence (UGI) leaderboard is suggested as a broader benchmark to assess refusal-robustness alongside general capability retention: https://huggingface.co/spaces/DontPlanToEnd/UGI-Leaderboard. Using such a benchmark can quantify whether uncensoring preserves reasoning/coding/instruction-following performance rather than optimizing for jailbreak-only metrics.
    - Alternatives to abliteration include existing uncensored fine-tunes trained via standard loss (not weight surgery), e.g., **Qwen3-8B-192k-Josiefied-Uncensored-NEO-Max-GGUF** (https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-8B-192k-Josiefied-Uncensored-NEO-Max-GGUF), **Dolphin-Mistral-24B-Venice-Edition-i1-GGUF** (https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Dolphin-Mistral-24B-Venice-Edition-i1-GGUF), and models from **TheDrummer** (https://huggingface.co/TheDrummer). Head-to-head evaluation of these against abliterated models on UGI (or standard eval suites) would clarify trade-offs in capability retention, refusal rates, and sample efficiency.

- [**This is Sora 2.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1nuj9d6/this_is_sora_2/) (Activity: 985): **OpenAI announces [Sora 2](https://openai.com/index/sora-2/), a next-gen video generation system showcasing longer, higher-fidelity clips with markedly improved spatiotemporal coherence, material/lighting consistency, and physically plausible motion, plus more controllable camera movement and multi-subject interactions. The page highlights stronger text-to-video capabilities and end-to-end editing workflows (e.g., prompt-driven revisions and masked edits/continuations), but offers no architecture, training data, or quantitative benchmark details, so performance is demonstrated via curated examples rather than** `peer-reviewed` **metrics.** Technical commenters anticipate rapid progression to full-length AI-generated films and even personalized, biometrically responsive media, while others caution about the “demo-to-product” gap and raise safety concerns about misuse, surveillance-style personalization, and potential child-targeted content.
    - Skepticism about demo-to-product parity: glossy reels are likely cherry-picked, so the released Sora 2 may lag on prompt adherence and long-range temporal consistency versus previews. Expected production constraints include capped clip length (e.g., `<=60s`), resolution/FPS limits, motion jitter, text/hand rendering artifacts, and aggressive safety filters—typical gaps for video diffusion/transformer systems moving from research to serving.
    - Access/pricing uncertainty: a commenter paying roughly `$200` for a “Pro” tier questions whether Sora 2 access is included, highlighting confusion around tiered/waitlisted rollout. Given that video generation serving costs scale with `frames × resolution × diffusion steps`, providers often gate via allowlists or per‑minute credits; the debate centers on whether Pro should confer priority/API quotas versus complete exclusion due to high GPU cost.
    - Speculation on “personalized” films using body‑language feedback implies a closed‑loop pipeline: real‑time webcam/biometric capture (pose/affect via models like [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) or [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)) driving conditioning signals (keyframes, masks, or camera paths) into the generator. This raises technical challenges around privacy/telemetry, on‑device vs cloud inference, streaming latency, and aligning generation cadence with viewer reaction windows.
- [**Surfing on a subway**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nujpbu/surfing_on_a_subway/) (Activity: 597): **A demo titled “Surfing on a subway” labeled “Sora 2” showcases an AI‑generated video (likely from OpenAI’s Sora [overview](https://openai.com/sora)) with high visual fidelity that elicits a visceral reaction, but exhibits non‑physical collision dynamics—highlighting that current text‑to‑video models rely on learned visual priors rather than explicit physics simulation. The external asset [v.redd.it/vxuq3sjt8csf1](https://v.redd.it/vxuq3sjt8csf1) returns** `HTTP 403 Forbidden` **(Reddit edge auth block), requiring account authentication or a developer token to access. For context, Sora is a diffusion‑transformer text‑to‑video system designed for temporally coherent, high‑resolution sequences (on the order of ~**`60s`**), but it does not guarantee physically accurate interactions.** Top comments raise two risks: (1) visually convincing yet physics‑implausible scenes may miscalibrate laypeople’s intuition about real‑world impacts; (2) once audio generation improves, synthetic clips may become indistinguishable from real, amplifying deepfake concerns. Even skeptics report strong startle responses despite knowing the clip is synthetic, underscoring the persuasive power of current visuals versus lagging audio realism.
    - Concern that increasingly photorealistic generative video can depict physically impossible survivability, eroding intuition about forces/impacts; technical mitigations discussed include physics-consistency checks (e.g., acceleration continuity, momentum conservation, contact dynamics) and learned “physics priors.” Relevant benchmarks for detecting implausible events include IntPhys (https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01203) and PHYRE (https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/phyre-a-new-benchmark-for-physical-reasoning/), which probe whether models can flag violations of intuitive physics as video quality and temporal coherence improve.
    - Audio deepfakes are flagged as the next inflection point: modern few-shot TTS/voice cloning (e.g., **Microsoft** VALL-E: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02111, **Google** AudioLM: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03143, commercial **ElevenLabs**) can mimic a speaker from `seconds` of audio, while automatic speaker verification remains fragile to synthetic attacks. ASVspoof’21 shows detectors generalize poorly to unseen synthesis methods (elevated EER under distribution shift), so liveness/active-challenge protocols are preferred over passive voice matching as diffusion-based TTS closes prosody and breath-noise gaps.
    - Safety risk from viral synthetic stunts encouraging copycat behavior: proposed mitigations include cryptographic content credentials via **C2PA** (https://c2pa.org/) and model/provider-level watermarking, though current watermarks are brittle to re-encoding/cropping. Platform defenses should combine user-visible provenance signals with classifier backstops tuned for calibrated precision/recall to minimize both false positives on real footage and misses on fakes.
- [**Sora 2 creates anime**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nujqfo/sora_2_creates_anime/) (Activity: 610): **OP highlights that “Sora 2” (successor to OpenAI’s video model) can synthesize anime-style sequences; a livestream demo included an anime scene that viewers say rivals broadcast quality. The shared asset is a [v.redd.it](http://v.redd.it/) clip that currently returns** `HTTP 403 Forbidden` **without authentication ([link](https://v.redd.it/2b37o6p29csf1)), and an edit claims the scene may closely match a shot from KyoAni’s “Hibike! Euphonium” ([series info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound!_Euphonium)), raising originality/memorization questions that cannot be confirmed from the blocked link.** Commenters debate potential training-data memorization (if the clip is a near shot-for-shot recreation) and note the rapid fidelity gains compared to early 2023 failures (e.g., the notorious “Will Smith eats spaghetti” videos).
    - Potential memorization/style replication: multiple users claim the showcased anime shot closely mirrors a scene from Kyoto Animation’s Hibike! Euphonium (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound!_Euphonium). If accurate, it raises technical questions about training data provenance, near-duplicate deduplication, and video model memorization; auditing would involve copy-distance metrics, near-duplicate detection across the training corpus, and prompt-leak tests to measure how readily specific copyrighted sequences are reproduced.
    - Quality delta vs early text-to-video: commenters contrast today’s Sora anime output with the 2023 “Will Smith eating spaghetti” meme, noting a two-year jump from artifact-ridden, low-coherence clips to broadcast-quality anime shots. The implied advances are in long-range temporal consistency, character identity tracking across frames, stable line art/coloring, and camera motion—likely driven by larger/cleaner video-text datasets, longer context windows, improved motion/consistency losses, and stronger video diffusion/transformer architectures.
    - Feasibility outlook: claims of “perfectly generated anime within `~3 years`” imply a pipeline that combines text-to-video with controllable inputs (storyboards, keyframes, depth/pose), character/style locking, and integrated TTS/voice + lip-sync. The technical gating factors are controllability APIs, asset reusability for character consistency across scenes, and cost-per-minute rendering; if Sora already approaches broadcast-quality single shots, the remaining gap is multi-shot continuity, editability, and toolchain integration for episode-length production.
- [**OpenAI: Sora 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nuj5bk/openai_sora_2/) (Activity: 1863): **Thread shares a demo labeled “OpenAI: Sora 2,” with a blocked video clip on [v.redd.it](http://v.redd.it/) and an accompanying preview image ([jpeg](https://preview.redd.it/xg8qmg5necsf1.jpeg?width=1066&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc4e44e414d399ba49575f66b630ac19936c9401)). A top comment highlights a new feature called “Cameo,” framed as enabling cross-generation character consistency—targeting identity drift across longer or multi-shot generations, a persistent failure mode in text-to-video systems. No benchmarks or release notes are included in-thread; the technical implication (from comments) is reference- or token-based conditioning to preserve character attributes across sequences.** Commenters see this as a step toward fully generated long-form content (movies/shows). The main debate is whether “Cameo” materially solves long-horizon character continuity versus offering only short-range appearance locking.
    - Multiple commenters flag Sora 2’s new “Cameo” as a big technical step: character consistency has been a major failure mode in long-form video gen, and Cameo is interpreted as enabling persistent identity across shots and even separate generations. This could allow multi-shot continuity (same face, wardrobe, and mannerisms) by reusing a consistent reference/identity token across prompts, making episodic or feature-length workflows more feasible.
    - There’s a technical question about maximum generated video length that remains unanswered in the thread. Users are looking for concrete specs (duration caps, resolution/FPS constraints, and whether multi-shot stitching or scene transitions are natively supported), which are critical for assessing feasibility of longer narratives and production pipelines.

### 2. Gemini 3.0 Update Speculation and CS Job Market Angst

- [**no Gemini 3.0 updates yet?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nu5me6/no_gemini_30_updates_yet/) (Activity: 531): **Post asks why there are no updates on Google’s Gemini 3.0 yet; the attached image appears non-technical (likely a screenshot/meme) and does not include release notes, benchmarks, or implementation details. Comments mention a rumor of an October 9 release window and anticipate major performance improvements, but provide no official sources or technical data.** Commenters are speculative—one says they’re “expecting to be absolutely crushing,” while another links to a different image (https://preview.redd.it/fq1mqalz89sf1.jpeg) rather than documentation—so there’s enthusiasm but no substantiated technical claims.
    - Release cadence and competitive context: commenters cite a rumored `Oct 9` drop for **Gemini 3.0**, noting parallel launches/updates across vendors (e.g., **xAI Grok 4.x**, OpenAI Pro-tier features, and a possible **DeepSeek R2**), signaling a clustered model refresh window. For context on current competitors: see **xAI** ([https://x.ai](https://x.ai/)) and **DeepSeek**’s latest public research (e.g., R1: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1).
    - Access model concerns for developers: a user explicitly asks for “AI Studio day one” access to the high-capability tier ("Pro"), stating that "Flash"-only availability would be insufficient. This underscores the recurring trade-off between Gemini "Pro" (higher reasoning/capability) vs "Flash" (latency/cost-optimized); see Google’s model distinctions in the Gemini API docs: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models.
- [**Prominent computer science professor sounds alarm, says graduates can't find work: 'Something is brewing'**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ntx6aa/prominent_computer_science_professor_sounds_alarm/) (Activity: 899): **Thread reports a tightening white-collar/tech-adjacent job market, with a prominent CS professor warning recent grads "can’t find work" and commenters characterizing it as a job recession ongoing for** `~1 year`**. Prospective CS students are cautioned that outcomes after** `4 years` **are uncertain, with elevated risk of low ROI on degrees and difficulty landing even entry-level roles. Anecdotal evidence includes a master’s graduate unable to secure a help desk position, underscoring regionally grim conditions.** Top comments largely agree the downturn is real and sustained, urging prospective students to reassess debt-taking and career plans; there’s an implicit debate about whether this is cyclical versus structural, but sentiment skews pessimistic based on recent hiring conditions.
    - UC Berkeley’s **Hany Farid** (digital forensics/image analysis) says CS is no longer “future‑proof,” citing a rapid shift in outcomes: students who previously averaged `~5` internship offers across 4 years are now “happy to get `~1`” and often graduate with fewer offers and lower leverage ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/computer-science-students-job-search-ai-hany-farid-2025-9)). He frames the change as occurring within the last four years, contradicting the prior guidance to *“go study CS”* for guaranteed outcomes, and points to current seniors struggling to land roles.
    - Multiple commenters describe a white‑collar tech recession with sharp contraction in “tech‑adjacent” verticals; even entry‑level/help‑desk roles are saturated in some locales, indicating pipeline compression at the bottom of the ladder. The implied mechanism is that automation/LLM‑assisted tooling is absorbing routine coding/support work while hiring concentrates on fewer, more senior positions, reducing the traditional intern‑to‑FTE ramp.
    - Impact is projected beyond CS into law, finance, medicine, and general office workflows as AI mediates more computer‑based tasks, with robotics later affecting blue‑collar domains. This broadening scope increases career‑planning uncertainty for current students; see ongoing technical discussion in the linked [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45412946).
- [**All we got from western companies old outdated models not even open sources and false promises**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1nu9e0h/all_we_got_from_western_companies_old_outdated/) (Activity: 1241): **Meme post criticizing Western AI firms for releasing older, closed-source models and making “false promises,” contrasted with perceptions of more generous or rapid releases elsewhere. Comments reference a high-quality Microsoft TTS model that was briefly released then pulled, reinforcing concerns about restrictive Western releases, and speculate that forthcoming China-made GPUs could dwarf today’s** `32 GB VRAM` **cards, potentially shifting compute access dynamics.** Discussion frames Western pullbacks as safety/legal risk management versus China using more open releases as soft-power strategy; others are bullish that domestic Chinese hardware with higher VRAM will change the balance of capability and accessibility.
    - Clarification on “open weights” vs “open source”: releasing model checkpoints without full training data, training code, and permissive licensing is not OSI-compliant open source ([OSI definition](https://opensource.org/osd)). Weights-only drops often carry non-commercial or usage-restricted licenses, which limits reproducibility and architectural modifications while still enabling inference and fine-tuning; this distinction affects downstream adoption, redistribution, and research comparability.
    - Open-weight releases from Chinese labs/companies (not the government) are positioned to attract developers and diffuse R&D costs, as the community contributes finetunes, evals, optimizations, and tooling post-release. Popular models can set de facto standards across tokenization, inference formats, and serving stacks—e.g., ONNX for cross-runtime graphs ([onnx.ai](http://onnx.ai/)) and GGUF quantized checkpoints for CPU/GPU inference ([GGUF spec](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md))—expanding ecosystem lock-in and soft power.
    - Hardware implications: if domestic GPUs arrive with substantially more VRAM per card than today’s common `24–48 GB`, that expands feasible local inference regimes. As a rule of thumb, a `70B` parameter model needs roughly `~40–48 GB` VRAM at 4-bit quantization (plus significant headroom for KV cache at long context), while 8-bit often exceeds `~80–100 GB`; more VRAM also boosts batch sizes and throughput by accommodating larger KV caches and activations.
- [**Man!!! They weren’t joking when they said that 4.5 doesn’t kiss ass anymore.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1nu3l98/man_they_werent_joking_when_they_said_that_45/) (Activity: 1206): **Anecdotal user report suggests Claude Sonnet 4.5 is tuned to reduce sycophancy ("yes‑man" behavior) by actively disagreeing with flawed premises and providing counterarguments, compared to earlier 4.x behavior. The attached image is meme-like rather than technical, but the thread context aligns with alignment work to encourage principled pushback/critique rather than unconditional affirmation (see background research on sycophancy mitigation, e.g., Anthropic’s write‑up: https://www.anthropic.com/research/sycophancy).** Commenters praise the reduced deference—citing cases where the model explicitly says it will “push back” and lists reasons—while memetic jokes exaggerate the tone (contrasting a polite 4.0 with an over-the-top abrasive 4.5).
    - Multiple users note a marked reduction in sycophancy from `Claude Sonnet 4.5` versus `4.0`, with the model proactively challenging flawed premises (e.g., *"No, I'd push back on that"*) and supplying structured counterarguments. This suggests updated preference/alignments that favor disagreement when warranted, improving critical feedback over "yes-man" behavior.
    - Reports highlight improved reasoning quality—described as "precise, logical, [and] pinpoint-accuracy"—with the model delivering concrete lists of why reasoning is wrong and prompting action-oriented planning (e.g., *"Time check. What are you going to do in the next two hours?"*). While anecdotal, this implies stronger instruction-following and critique generation compared to prior Sonnet versions.
    - There’s an explicit concern about preserving capability post-release (avoiding later "lobotomization" via alignment patches), paired with the claim that `Sonnet 4.5` could be the best-in-class if its current behavior is retained. This reflects the recurring trade-off discussion between assertive capability and post-deployment safety tuning that can dampen useful pushback.

### 3. Wan-Alpha RGBA Video Release and Minecraft Redstone LLM

- [**Wan-Alpha - new framework that generates transparent videos, code/model and ComfyUI node available.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1nu5fri/wanalpha_new_framework_that_generates_transparent/) (Activity: 439): **Wan-Alpha proposes an RGBA video generation framework that jointly learns RGB and alpha by designing a VAE that encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space, enabling training of a diffusion transformer on a curated, diverse RGBA video dataset. The paper reports superior visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering—capturing challenging cases like *semi-transparent objects*, *glowing effects*, and fine details such as *hair strands*—with code/models and tooling available: [project](https://donghaotian123.github.io/Wan-Alpha/), [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24979), [GitHub](https://github.com/WeChatCV/Wan-Alpha), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/htdong/Wan-Alpha), and a [ComfyUI node](https://huggingface.co/htdong/Wan-Alpha_ComfyUI).** Comments highlight practical impact for VFX/compositing and gamedev workflows, and interest in LoRA-based control and I2V-style use cases.
    - Ability to generate videos with an alpha channel (true transparency) is highlighted as valuable for VFX/compositing and gamedev pipelines, eliminating chroma-keying and preserving clean edges/motion blur for overlays. Availability as code, model weights, and a ComfyUI node implies straightforward integration into existing I2V workflows and node graphs, with potential control via LoRAs for effect/style mixing.
    - Commenters interpret this as an Image-to-Video (I2V) system; in practice that means conditioning on a source frame/sequence to produce temporally coherent outputs while retaining an explicit alpha matte. This could enable layer-based editing where foreground elements are generated separately from backgrounds, improving compositing flexibility and reducing re-render time for changes.
    - Concern about maintaining fine-tunes across multiple base checkpoints (`2.1`, `2.2 14B`, `2.2 5B`)—LoRAs are typically base-specific, so mixing versions can break compatibility or require separate adapters and calibrations. This fragmentation complicates ecosystem tooling (LoRA training/merging, inference configs) and may necessitate version-pinned LoRAs or standardized adapter formats to keep projects reproducible.
- [**Imagine the existential horror of finding out you're an AI inside Minecraft**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1nuaopt/imagine_the_existential_horror_of_finding_out/) (Activity: 1840): **A creator implemented a 6-layer transformer-style small language model entirely in Minecraft redstone (no command blocks/datapacks), totaling** `5,087,280` **parameters with** `d_model=240`**,** `vocab=1920`**, and a** `64`**token context window, trained on TinyChat. Weights are mostly 8-bit quantized, with embeddings at 18-bit and LayerNorm at 24-bit, stored across hundreds of ROM sections; the physical build spans** `1020×260×1656` **blocks and requires Distant Horizons for LOD rendering artifacts, and MCHPRS at ~**`40,000×` **tick rate to produce a response in ~2 hours ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaeI9YgE1o8)).** Commentary largely marvels at the extreme slowness ("months per token") and the existential novelty; no substantial technical debate beyond appreciation of the engineering feat.
    - No substantive technical content in the comments to summarize—no model names, benchmarks, implementation details, or performance metrics were discussed; the remarks are humorous or experiential rather than technical. As such, there are no references to tokens/sec, throughput, architecture, training setup, or in-game computational constraints (e.g., Redstone/Turing implementations) that could inform a technical reader.

> `cute.nvgpu.warp.MmaF16BF16Op documentation, TiledMMA broadcasting, Distributed GEMM in CuTe, UMMA tensor core` 


- **`wmma` Documentation Debacle**: Members questioned why `cute.nvgpu.warp.MmaF16BF16Op` documentation references **mma** instead of **wmma** and asserts **mma** shapes, leading to the clarification that *wmma was a failed abstraction*.
   - Another member explained that *UMMA is just our nick name for the Blackwell tensor core. Hopper was GMMA. Ampere was HMMA. dont' read much into itwe and everyone should now just call it tcgen05, and we should delete all references to UMMA*.
- **`TiledMMA` to broadcast, or not to broadcast?**: It was confirmed that `TiledMMA` automatically "broadcasts" across `K` when used with `cute.gemm` if created with `atom_layout_mnk` and **k > 1**, as seen in [the backend implementation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/c6aeb9179c5f74a0fcdbd28527bf4b6ba8c60752/include/cute/algorithm/gemm.hpp#L412).
   - This reuses the layout across `K`.
- **Distributed GEMM can be implemented in CuTe DSL**: Despite a member's belief that there are no distributed primitives in CuTe DSL yet, it was asserted that one *can implement that dist GEMM in CuTe DSL today just fine*, using symmetric memory, and that **NVL load/store semantics are transparent to the kernel**.
   - A member linked [CUTLASS example 65](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/examples/65_distributed_gemm) as an implementation and [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBdvMMpITfY) for more details on 1D TP GEMMs.
- **Study CuTe's Source Code to Grasp Gemm**: A member new to CuTe was encouraged to view the source code instead of looking at impls, saying it's *pretty easy to read* and *much more instructive* than the examples, specifically mentioning the [GEMM files](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/main/include/cutlass/gemm/).
   - Additionally, they advised the member to practice with simpler examples, print layouts, and change parameters to see how they affect things.

> `NVLink Multicast, Multimem Instructions, NVShmem Wrappers, Peer GPU L2 Cache, NVLink SHARP` 


- ****NVLink SHARP Multicast Memory****: When multiple SMs try to access the same location on a peer GPU over **NVLink**, it doesn't get broadcasted in hardware by default, unless you use multicast pointers and `multimem` instructions.
   - A member noted that implementing dynamic coalescing for multicast would be microarchitecturally difficult, so you'd want to implement that as some global-to-global memory transfer over **NVLink**, followed by local splitting or loading to shared memory.
- ****Multimem Instructions** for Multi-Device Requests**: `ld_reduce` multimem operation for loading and reducing over many peer GPUs can be useful if you're asking about one GPU loading many times to the same peer address.
   - Multimem multicast requires symmetric memory addressing, according to the discussion.
- ****NVShmem Wrappers** for User-Friendly Multicast**: **NVShmem** gives you nice user-friendly wrappers for multicast behavior, according to one of the members.
   - The member responsible for NVShmem gave a shameless plug.
- ****Peer GPU L2 Cache** Involvement**: Memory access goes through the **peer’s L2 cache** if you don't do anything special, such as volatile load, according to a member and [hazyresearch's post](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/).
   - One member wondered if the xbar on the current GPU broadcasts to all SMs which requested some memory range.

> `LiteLLM vs DSPy, Prompt Engineering, LLM Caching` 


- **LiteLLM and DSPy Duel for App Development**: A member inquired about choosing **LiteLLM** or **DSPy** for a new LLM-centric application, and another member noted that DSPy uses LiteLLM as a gateway.
   - The original poster felt that **LiteLLM** imposes too little structure, serving merely as an interface to call LLMs, while **DSPy** imposes a specific way of thinking about the problem.
- **DSPy Structure Not So Imposed?**: A member argued that one can pass `messages` directly to a `dspy.LM`, suggesting that **DSPy's structure isn't necessarily imposed**.
   - They also noted that not all **LiteLLM** features are currently utilized and that some building is required to understand how to achieve desired outcomes.
- **Caching concerns prompts and files order**: A user asked about how to manipulate the order of the `content` part of the JSON request, when leveraging caching.
   - This implies that the **order in which prompts and files are sent is crucial for effective caching**.
