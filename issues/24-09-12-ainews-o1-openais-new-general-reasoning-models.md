  **OpenAI** has released the **o1** model family, including **o1-preview** and
  **o1-mini**, focusing on test-time reasoning with extended output token limits
  over 30k tokens. The models show strong performance, ranking in the 89th
  percentile on competitive programming, excelling in USA Math Olympiad
  qualifiers, and surpassing PhD-level accuracy on physics, biology, and
  chemistry benchmarks. Notably, **o1-mini** performs impressively despite its
  smaller size compared to **gpt-4o**. The release highlights new scaling laws
  for test-time compute that scale loglinearly. Additionally, **Nvidia** is
  reportedly losing AI chip market share to startups, with a shift in developer
  preference from CUDA to **llama** models for web development, though Nvidia
  remains dominant in training. This news reflects significant advances in
  reasoning-focused models and shifts in AI hardware competition.

> AI News for 9/11/2024-9/12/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**216** channels, and **4377** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **416 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

o1, aka Strawberry, aka Q*, is [finally out](https://openai.com/o1/#snake-video)! There are two models we can use today: o1-preview (the bigger one priced at $15 in / $60 out) and o1-mini (the STEM-reasoning focused distillation priced at $3 in/$12 out) - and the main o1 model is still in training. This caused a little [bit of confusion](https://x.com/giffmana/status/1834306463142949338).

There are a raft of relevant links, so don’t miss:

- the [o1 Hub](https://openai.com/o1/#snake-video)
- the [o1-preview blogpost](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/)
- the [o1-mini blogpost](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41523050)

Inline with the many, many leaks leading up to today, the core story is longer “test-time inference” aka longer step by step responses - in the ChatGPT app this shows up as a new “thinking” step that you can click to expand for reasoning traces, even though, controversially, they are hidden from you (interesting conflict of interest…):


![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/4839e35d-1f4e-4e25-bdc7-9ffd8a327128.png?w=960&fit=max)


Under the hood, o1 is trained for adding new **reasoning tokens** - which you pay for, and OpenAI has accordingly extended the output token limit to >30k tokens (incidentally this is also why a number of API parameters from the other models like `temperature` and `role` and tool calling and streaming, but especially `max_tokens` is no longer supported).

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b52a6e7b-024c-4476-94f4-57c63001d0da.png?w=960&fit=max)

The evals are exceptional. OpenAI o1:

- ranks in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions (Codeforces),
- places among the top 500 students in the US in a qualifier for the USA Math Olympiad (AIME),
- and exceeds human PhD-level accuracy on a benchmark of physics, biology, and chemistry problems (GPQA).

You are used to new models showing flattering charts, but there is one of note that you don’t see in many model announcements, that is probably the most important chart of all. Dr Jim Fan gets it right: we now have **scaling laws for test time compute, and it looks like they scale loglinearly**.

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6927a289-f8ac-46db-b7bb-55f4ca34d026.png?w=960&fit=max)


We unfortunately may never know the drivers of the reasoning improvements, but [Jason Wei shared some hints](https://x.com/_jasonwei/status/1834278706522849788?s=46):

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/857e5294-2903-4775-854d-03dd4db02c98.png?w=960&fit=max)

Usually the big model gets all the accolades, but notably many are calling out the performance of o1-mini for its size (smaller than gpt 4o), so do not miss that.

> - `Hallucinations in Language Models`
> - `Dolphin Architecture for Long Contexts`
> - `Projector in Language Models`
> - `Efficiency in Language Processing` 


- **Hallucinations as Inevitable Features in LLMs**: A recent paper argues that **hallucinations** in Large Language Models (LLMs) are not merely occasional errors but are fundamental to their design, citing **Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem** as a basis.
   - The authors emphasize that improving architecture or datasets won't eliminate hallucinations, which are likely present in every stage of the LLM process.
- **Dolphin Model Redefines Long Context Handling**: The **Dolphin** architecture presents a compact **0.5B parameter** decoder to efficiently manage extensive context in language models, showcasing significant reductions in energy consumption and latency.
   - By encoding long textual contexts as a distinct modality, it aims for a **10-fold improvement in energy efficiency** and a **5-fold reduction in latency**.
- **Innovative Projector for Contextual Information**: Dolphin utilizes a **multi-layer perceptron (MLP)** projector to convert embedding information from the text encoder into context token embeddings for the main decoder.
   - This method effectively connects different embedding dimensions, bridging the information between the compact 0.5B and the main **7B parameter** decoder model.
- **Discussion on Context Conditioning Techniques**: A member discussed how Dolphin seeks to condition the model with fewer prefix tokens to produce results similar to longer histories, utilizing MLPs for projection.
   - This highlights an innovative approach to maximizing the latent space effects in models despite reduced context inputs.

> - `Impact of context length on compute`
> - `Multiple branches in CoT`
> - `Tree search dynamics`
> - `Log-log plot observations` 


- **CoT Scaling Shows Linear to Quadratic Shift**: When scaling test time compute using **Chain of Thought (CoT)**, the compute scales linearly with context length until it reaches a certain threshold, after which the **quadratic cost of attention** takes over.
   - This should result in a distinct **kink in the scaling law curve** if sampled densely enough unless the **value** of tokens changes to counteract this effect.
- **Using Multiple Branches in CoT Controversy**: There was a discussion about the feasibility of using **multiple branches of CoT**, with skepticism expressed regarding its ability to mitigate earlier discussed effects.
   - *One member mentioned* that generating many short, fixed-size chains independently might help, but it raises questions about scaling dynamics.
- **Branching Factor's Limited Impact on Scaling**: Another member suggested that *regardless of the branching factor*, it would just act as a **b^n multiplier** in front of the single context scaling effect.
   - This indicates that the **kink in compute scaling** observed before would still appear in the log-log plot.

> - `HTML chunking package`
> - `Web automation tools`
> - `HTML parsing techniques` 


- **Introducing the HTML Chunking Package**: A new package called `html_chunking` has been launched, which efficiently chunks and merges HTML content while respecting token limits for web automation tasks.
   - The process is well-structured, ensuring accurate HTML parsing and maintaining a preserved structure with attributes tagged appropriately for use in various applications.
- **Demo Code for HTML Chunking**: A demo snippet was shared showing how to use `get_html_chunks` from the `html_chunking` package to process an HTML string with a maximum token limit, preserving valid HTML structure.
   - The output results in multiple chunks of valid HTML, truncating excessively long attributes to ensure manageable lengths.
- **Comparison with Existing Tools**: The HTMLChunking package is positioned as a superior solution for chunking HTML compared to LangChain's `HTMLHeaderTextSplitter` and LlamaIndex's `HTMLNodeParser`, which strip the HTML context.
   - These existing tools only extract text content, limiting their utility in scenarios where the full HTML context is essential.
- **Call to Action: Explore HTML Chunking**: Users are encouraged to investigate `html_chunking` for web automation and related tasks, highlighting its benefits for accurate HTML chunking.
   - Links to the [HTML chunking PYPI page](https://pypi.org/project/html-chunking/) and their [Github repo](https://github.com/KLGR123/html_chunking) were provided for further exploration.
