The post warns of widespread automatic blocking and potential deletion of adult content under the updated Terms of Service, citing test uploads of both explicit and non-explicit material that were disproportionately blocked. The concern centers on the technical limitations and false positives of the AI system, potentially leading to overzealous or unintended censorship of adult or borderline content.** Comments challenge the sensational nature of the claims, pointing out that some blocked NSFW content was unblocked after metadata review and highlighting a lack of evidence for a planned site-wide purge. Skeptics note the OP's visible explicit uploads that remain accessible, suggesting that while false positives may exist, claims of an imminent purge are unsubstantiated.
    - A user clarifies that the new CivitAI policy revolves around automated blocking (via metadata-based review) rather than a mass purge of NSFW content. They report that some of their NSFW videos were automatically blocked after a policy change but were subsequently unblocked upon submitting correct metadata, indicating the system's reliance on content classification rather than outright bans. They also mention the presence of potential false positives in the block system, but see no current evidence for wholesale removal of explicit content.
    - Another commenter discusses backup strategies for models, mentioning backing up over `200+ GB` of LoRAs for Stable Diffusion 1.5 XL and pony models, as well as the use of automated scripts (referenced as a likely existing GitHub project) for category-based downloading. The user notes their local storage size (`~10 TB`) and identifies download speed from CivitAI, rather than their fiber internet or disk space, as the primary bottleneck.
    - There is parallel drawn to past internet censorship events (such as the Tumblr NSFW ban), highlighting importance of model/data preservation for those interested in adult content generation, as users are proactively downloading and archiving their datasets in anticipation of potential policy changes.

> `Mac RAM, GPU vs CPU offloading, VRAM requirements for LLMs, Qwen model performance` 


- **Macs offer TBs of RAM**: Members are considering **Macs** with up to **512 GB of RAM**, anticipating future models will require **TBs** of memory, since PCs are a hassle due to needing many cards.
   - The high RAM capacity is seen as beneficial for AI tasks, especially for those with *basic interest in AI* who prefer not to deal with complex PC setups.
- **GPU Offloading**: Members discussed the performance of **GPU offloading** compared to **CPU-only** processing, specifically for running a **70B LLM** file (**~40GB**).
   - One member noted that in past tests they observed offloading with **24GB cards** achieving around **1 t/s**, similar to their **CPU-only** performance of **0.8-0.9 t/s**.
- **VRAM and Context Size Limit LLM Performance**: Members highlighted the impact of **VRAM** capacity on **LLM** performance, noting that models running outside of **VRAM** will be slow and that required memory increases with context size.
   - It was shared that most **Q4** or **Q5** versions of **32B models** require **22-23 GB** of **VRAM** to start, and one user experienced slowness with a **32B model** on **16GB VRAM**.
- **Qwen 3 speeds on RTX 3090**: One member reported performance results for **Qwen 3 32B Q4_K_M** achieving **30 tokens/sec** on a **3090 RTX** (**24 GB VRAM**) with a **16384 context**.

> `Model Output Quirks, Token Parsing, Model Specs Update` 


- **Model's Quirky Output Token Patterns**: Members discussed the tendency of some models, like **Qwen**, to output extra tokens such as markdown code block delimiters around tool calls.
   - It was suggested that this is acceptable because developers can easily parse out the correct part by removing those extra tokens via `model_response.replace("<tool_call>", "<|tool_call|>")`.
- **Token Parsing Solution Proposed**: It was proposed that a simple fix, like adding instructions to the model card, could resolve the issue of extra tokens during model output.
   - Another member agreed that this was a reasonable approach, noting its simplicity and ease of implementation.
- **Model Specs Update Alternative Considered**: As an alternative solution, one member suggested that the model specifications be updated to indicate the use of `<tool_call>`. 
   - This approach would inform users about the expected output format and potential parsing requirements.
