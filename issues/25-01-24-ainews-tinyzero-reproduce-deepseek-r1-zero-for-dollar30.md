DeepSeek Mania continues to [realign the frontier model landscape](https://www.latent.space/p/reasoning-price-war). Jiayi Pan from Berkeley reproduced the *OTHER* result from the DeepSeek R1 paper, R1-Zero, in a cheap Qwen model finetune, **for two math tasks** (so not a general result at all, but a nice proof of concept).

[Full code and WandB logs available.](https://github.com/Jiayi-Pan/TinyZero)

The most interesting new finding is that there is a lower bound to [the distillation effect we covered yesterday](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-bespoke-stratos-sky-t1-the-vicunaalpaca/) - 1.5B is as low as you go. RLCoT reasoning is itself an emergent property.

More findings: 

- RL technique (PPO, DeepSeek's GRPO, or [PRIME](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-prime-process-reinforcement-through/)) [doesnt really matter](https://x.com/jiayi_pirate/status/1882839504899420517)
- Starting from [Instruct model converges faster](https://x.com/jiayi_pirate/status/1882839494828896730) but otherwise both end the same (as per R1 paper observation)
