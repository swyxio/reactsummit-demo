description: >-
  **Alibaba Qwen** released their **QwQ-32B** model, a **32 billion parameter**
  reasoning model using a novel two-stage reinforcement learning approach: first
  scaling RL for math and coding tasks with accuracy verifiers and code
  execution servers, then applying RL for general capabilities like instruction
  following and alignment. Meanwhile, **OpenAI** rolled out **GPT-4.5** to Plus
  users, with mixed feedback on coding performance and noted inference cost
  improvements. The QwQ model aims to compete with larger MoE models like
  **DeepSeek-R1**. *"GPT-4.5 is unusable for coding"* was a notable user
  critique, while others praised its reasoning improvements due to scaling
  pretraining.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Two stage RL is all you need?**

> AI News for 3/5/2025-3/6/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**227** channels, and **3619** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **351 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

As previewed [last November](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwq-32b-preview/) and again [last month](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwq-max-preview/), the Alibaba Qwen team is [finally out](https://x.com/altryne/status/1897373582076076387) with their final version of QwQ, their Qwen2.5-Plus + Thinking (QwQ) post train boasting numbers comparable to R1 which is an MoE as much as 20x larger.

It's still early so no independent checks available yet, but  the Qwen team have done the bare essentials to reassure us that they have not simply overfit to benchmarks in order to get this result - in that they boast decent non-math/coding benchmark numbers still, and gave us one paragraph on how:

> - **In the initial stage, we scale RL specifically for math and coding tasks.** Rather than relying on traditional reward models, we utilized an accuracy verifier for math problems to ensure the correctness of final solutions and a code execution server to assess whether the generated codes successfully pass predefined test cases. As training episodes progress, performance in both domains shows continuous improvement. 
> - **After the first stage, we add another stage of RL for general capabilities.** It is trained with rewards from general reward model and some rule-based verifiers. We find that this stage of RL training with a small amount of steps can increase the performance of other general capabilities, such as instruction following, alignment with human preference, and agent performance, without significant performance drop in math and coding.


More information - a paper, sample data, sample code - could help understand, but this is fair enough for a 2025 open model disclosure. It will take a while more for QwQ-32B to rank on [the Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/?pinned=Qwen%2FQwQ-32B-Preview_bfloat16_1032e81cb936c486aae1d33da75b2fbcd5deed4a_True%2Cdeepseek-ai%2FDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B_bfloat16_07a264a567ba0863a4ab34fdb3c2b8a54e0bb494_True%2Cmeta-llama%2FLlama-3.3-70B-Instruct_bfloat16__True&params=65%2C141&official=true) but here is where things currently stand, as a reminder that thinking posttrains aren't strictly better than their instruct predecessor.

   - The framework is already running in production with a client and focuses on **knowledge graph RAGs, reinforcement learning, and cognitive architectures**.
- **Adapters Decouple Signatures in DSPy**: **DSPy's adapters system** decouples the signature (declarative specification of what you want) from how different providers produce completions.
   - By default, **DSPy** uses a well-tuned **ChatAdapter** and falls back to **JSONAdapter**, leveraging structured outputs APIs for constrained decoding in providers like **VLLM**, **SGLang**, **OpenAI**, **Databricks**, etc.
- **DSPy Simplifies Explicit Type Specification**: DSPy simplifies explicit type specification with code like ```contradictory_pairs: list[dict[str, str]] = dspy.OutputField(desc="List of contradictory pairs, each with fields for text numbers, contradiction result, and justification.")```, but this is technically ambiguous because it doesn't specify the `dict`'s keys.
   - Instead, consider ```list[some_pydantic_model]``` where **some_pydantic_model** has the right fields.
- **DSPy Resolves Straggler Threads**: [PR 7914](https://github.com/stanford-nlp/dspy/pull/791) (merged) addresses stuck *straggler* threads in `dspy.Evaluate` or `dspy.Parallel`, aiming for smoother operation.

> `OWUI Integration, LM Studio R1, Aider Output, OpenRouter API, Commit Messages` 


- **Hack OWUI with OAI-Compatible Aider**: To connect **Aider** to **OpenWebUI (OWUI)**, prefix the model name with `openai/` so that *litellm* knows you're using an **OAI-compatible endpoint**, such as `openai/myowui-openrouter.openai/gpt-4o-mini`.
   - This resolves the `litellm.BadRequestError` when using **Aider** with **OWUI**.
- **Aider's Fault in DeepSeek Provider Issue**: A member stated that if **OpenRouter** is not responding with tokens, it may be due to **litellm** and **Aider's fault**, not with the **DeepSeek provider**.
   - A patch ([PR #8431](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/8431)) was merged for the reasoning field with **OpenRouter**, but it may require a local patch for Aider to show the reasoning content.
- **Commit Messages**: A member suggested a solution to have **aider** write a commit message for the files you've staged rather than all the changes in your working tree: `git stash save --keep-index`, then `/commit`, finally `git stash pop`.
   - Aider can also be used as a committer with `aider --commit` which writes the commit message, commits, and exits.
- **The Quest For Good (Free) Editor Model**: Members discussed good models to use as `editor-model`, with suggestions including `qwencoder2.5:32b` for the weak model (for commit and compressing/summarizing history) and `gemini flash` for edits.
   - Other members reported good results with `o3-mini-high` as architect and `deepseek-v3` as editor.
- **/web Command**: A member reported that the `/web` command wasn't working, even after letting **Aider** install **Playwright** and was not adding it to the context.
   - Another member confirmed that it worked, suggesting verifying if the content was added to chat by asking a question based on the scraped page.

- **Detect VRAM Overflow by Watching Shared Memory**: A member shared how to detect VRAM overflow by monitoring **Dedicated memory** and **Shared memory** usage, noting that overflow occurs when *Dedicated memory* is high and *Shared memory* increases, illustrated in the [attached image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1110598183144399061/1346803804322009088/VRAM_Overflow.jpg?ex=67ca2d09&is=67c8db89&hm=24b703c40c580b2636786230775506086194cec8387515d56546d86fefc79989&).
- **Audio Modality Missing on Phi-4 in LM Studio**: Members confirmed that **multi-modal Phi-4** and **audio support** are not currently available in LM Studio due to limitations in *llama.cpp*.
- **KV Cache Keeps Your VRAM On Lock**: A member explained that **context size** and **KV cache** settings significantly impact VRAM usage, recommending aiming for **90% VRAM** utilization to optimize performance.
   - Another member defined KV cache as the *value of K and V* when the computer is doing the attention mechanics math, i.e. (Q*K^T/dK).
- **Sesame AI's TTS: Open Source or Smoke and Mirrors?**: Members discussed **Sesame AI's conversational speech generation model (CSM)**, with one member praising its lifelike qualities, including *breathing* and *emotional tone*, linking to a [demo](https://www.sesame.com).
   - Others expressed skepticism about its *open-source* claim, noting the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SesameAILabs) lacks code commits.
- **QwQ Model Template Issue Gets a Patch**: Users reported issues running **QwQ models** in LM Studio, specifically encountering *OpenSquareBracket !== CloseStatement* errors with the *Junja template*.
   - A member shared a potential fix from a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-bug-tracker/issues/479#issuecomment-2701947624), which involved adjusting model prompt parameters, and confirmed it resolved their issues, however, others still consider it not good.

> `Reshaping vs Permuting, Matrix Transformations` 


- **Reshaping differs from Permuting Matrices**: *Reshaping* a matrix does not alter the order of elements in row-major order, whereas *permuting* (e.g., **transposing**) does change the element order.
   - For an **M x N** matrix reshaped to **N x M**, reading elements in row-major order remains consistent, but transposing the matrix alters this order.
- **Understanding Matrix Transformations**: Reshaping can be thought of as reorganizing the matrix without changing the underlying order of elements when read in a specific way.
   - Permuting, on the other hand, actively rearranges the positions of elements, leading to a different sequence when read in the same order.

> `Bilevel Optimization, Sparsemax Generalization, DDP Garbled Weights, MPEC translation, AI method complexity` 


- **Bilevel Optimization Faces Skepticism**: A member argued that bilevel optimization doesn't inherently offer anything beyond standard optimization techniques, despite its potential for algorithmic and reformulation benefits, linking to a [discussion of bilevel optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilevel_optimization).
   - They emphasized that bilevel programming's utility is primarily intuitive, as it translates into a **Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC)** solved as a single-level Nonlinear Programming problem (NLP).
- **Sparsemax as Bilevel Max: An AI Reframing?**: A member proposed framing **Sparsemax** as a bilevel optimization (BO) problem, suggesting its potential to dynamically adjust different Neural Network layers.
   - Countering this, another member detailed **Sparsemax** as a projection onto a probability simplex with a closed-form solution, using Lagrangian duality to demonstrate that the computation simplifies to water-filling which can be found in closed form.
- **Diffusion Models defy Closed-Form**: A member noted the limitations of simplifying AI methods to single-level closed forms, particularly in complex scenarios like **diffusion models**, quoting *Sampling flexibility* does not require a full closed-form expression.

> `Optimizing intent classification with DSPy, Comparing texts for contradictions, DSPy adapters system, Straggler threads in dspy.Evaluate and dspy.Parallel` 


- **DSPy optimizes intent classification**: DSPy can help to optimize classification of intents that requires specialized agents.
   - One user was heading in this direction.
- **Comparing Texts for Contradictions: Computational Intensive Tasks**: Comparing two pieces of texts for contradictions is computationally intensive; using dspy's **CoT module** takes significant time with large data.
   - One user explored providing multiple pairs through one shot, noting some reservations about the **LLM's** ability to respect the expected return structure when returning a list of pairs, especially when using `OutputField`.
- **DSPy Simplifies Explicit Type Specification**: DSPy simplifies explicit type specification with code like ```contradictory_pairs: list[dict[str, str]] = dspy.OutputField(desc="List of contradictory pairs, each with fields for text numbers, contradiction result, and justification.")```, but this is technically ambiguous because it doesn't specify the `dict`'s keys.
   - Instead, consider ```list[some_pydantic_model]``` where **some_pydantic_model** has the right fields.
- **DSPy's Adapters System Decouples Signature From Providers**: DSPy's **adapters** system decouples the signature (declarative specification of what you want) from how different providers produce completions.
   - By default, DSPy uses a well-tuned **ChatAdapter** and falls back to **JSONAdapter**, leveraging structured outputs APIs for constrained decoding in providers like **VLLM**, **SGLang**, **OpenAI**, **Databricks**, etc.
- **Straggler Threads Resolved for Smoother DSPy Evaluation**: [PR 7914](https://github.com/stanford-nlp/dspy/pull/791) (merged) addresses stuck *straggler* threads in `dspy.Evaluate` or `dspy.Parallel`, aiming for smoother operation.
   - This fix will be available in **DSPy 2.6.11**; users can test it from `main` without code changes.

- **Tokenizer Customization Troubles**: A user downloads from HF and has some custom tokenizer logic represented in their own **special_tokens.json**, but the original downloaded one is saved in the checkpoint directory after training.
   - The suspected culprit is [this section of code](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/blob/80da6a5dae23a201595d07041c12ffde830332d7/torchtune/training/checkpointing/_checkpointer.py#L892-896) which assumes that most of the non-model files downloaded from HF are useful as-is.
- **Quick Fix Proposed for Tokenizer Issue**: The suggested quick fix involves replacing the downloaded **special_tokens.json** with the user's own version in the downloaded model directory.
   - Members discussed potentially making the *copy_files* and *save_checkpoint* logic more general to allow for customization.
- **Checkpointer save method arg**: One member suggested supporting this use case by passing a new arg to the checkpointer's **save_checkpoint** method, but this would also need to be exposed via config.
   - Members were considering whether it's worth exposing anything new without a really strong reason.
