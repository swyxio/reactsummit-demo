- **Multi-GPU Multi-Node Saving Issue**: `@lykon78` reports errors when saving a final model (mistral fft) on a multi-GPU, multi-node configuration. They suspect distributed saving might not be implemented correctly, especially since the error originates from the non-master node.
  
- **No Difference with Identical Configurations**: `@lykon78` confirms that both nodes have the same configuration, folder structure, and identical versions of Python libraries. The command used for running the model includes `torchrun` with DeepSpeed configurations.

- **Distributed Training Challenges**: `@nanobitz` and `@caseus_` discuss potential issues with multi-node setups, acknowledging a lack of extensive testing with `axolotl` and the need to synchronize checkpoint data across nodes.

- **Looking into Transformer Library Fixes**: `@lykon78` investigates a similar issue with multi-node training in the transformers library, referencing a pull request that might contain the fix, but notes the issue persists even with the latest version (4.37.2) which should have addressed it.

- **Code Tweaks Required for Multi-Node Saving**: `@caseus_` suggests that code alterations are necessary to enable model saving on each node by modifying `TrainingArguments`, and `@lykon78` expresses willingness to test any proposed code changes.

- **Troubleshooting DPO Results**: `@fred_fups` questioned the **DPO** results as being unreliable and sought guidance after using **Qlora** with a Mistral model trained on non-DPO data. `@xzuyn` advised that the learning rate might be too high and recommended lowering it significantly.
- **DPO and Learning Rates**: `@xzuyn` suggested that **DPO** generally requires a much lower learning rate compared to standard fine-tuning and recommended that `@fred_fups` add "another 0 or two" to the learning rate for better results.
- **Alpaca vs ChatML in DPO**: `@fred_fups` inquired about the possibility of using **Alpaca format** with **DPO**, but `@xzuyn` indicated that **ChatML** is the only supported format, though custom formats might be possible.
