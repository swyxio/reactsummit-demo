<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 4/16/2024-4/17/2024. We checked 6 subreddits and [**364** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **27** Discords (**395** channels, and **5173** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **587 minutes**.

As is their established pattern, Mistral followed up their magnet link [with a blogpost](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-8x22b/), and an instruct-tuned version of their 8x22B model:

- **Quandaries About Quantization Axes**: Quantizing with `axis=0` for GPT's Q, K, V was found problematic in `gpt-fast` due to mixing of parameters during quantization. An ongoing discussion suggests quantizing Q, K, and V separately might be a solution, noting that `weight_int4pack_mm` currently only supports `axis=1`.

- **Speed Versus Quality Compromises in HQQ**: The trade-offs between speed and quality when using `axis=0` or `axis=1` in Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ) were explored. A member reported equivalent performance of 5.375 perplexity for both axes on `gpt-fast`.

- **Pursuing Further Optimizations**: A mention of using [Triton kernels](https://github.com/wangsiping97/FastGEMV/tree/main) and other methods like fake data to optimize performance along `axis=1`. They noted that method using autograd and randomly generated data gave slightly better results (5.3311 ppl) than HQQ with more iterations.

- **Exploring Extended Capabilities and Demystifying Differences**: Insights into the potential impact of in-channel variation on weight quantization accuracy were shared, referring to steeling quants with `axis=0` appearing to yield better results. The conversation indicated that HQQ effectively finds optimal solutions faster compared to lengthy autograd optimization.

- **Implementational Details and Benchmarks Shared**: Links were provided to the implementation details, such as a [torch int4mm demo](https://github.com/mobiusml/hqq/blob/master/examples/backends/torchao_int4_demo.py) with transformers as well as the [optimizer code using autograd](https://github.com/mobiusml/hqq/blob/master/hqq/core/optimize.py#L412) and discussions were centered around potentially speeding up operations further with vectorized fp16 multiplication and the practicality of lower precision quantization like 2/3 bits.

- **New Transformer Architecture for Long Inputs**: A recent proposal for a novel Transformer architecture named [Feedback Attention Memory (FAM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09173) aims to enable processing of indefinitely long sequences by allowing the network to attend to its own latent representations, thus overcoming the quadratic attention complexity. FAM's performance showed significant improvement on long-context tasks.

- **Advances in Brain Decoding Research**: The paper [MindBridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07850v1) introduces a new approach that allows for cross-subject brain decoding by employing only one model, addressing three main challenges in the field: variability in brain sizes, individual neural pattern differences, and limited data for new subjects.

- **Rethinking Scaling Laws' Accuracy**: Discrepancies pointed out in the compute-optimal scaling laws presented by Hoffmann et al. (2022) highlight the importance of data transparency, as [a new analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10102) suggests that the original narrow confidence intervals were implausible unless an extensive number of experiments were conducted.

- **Expressive Power of State-Space Models**: A discussion was prompted by the [analysis of State-Space Models (SSMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08819), revealing that their expressive power for state tracking is very similar to transformers and SSMs cannot express computation beyond the complexity class $\mathsf{TC}^0$. The dialogue also touched upon clarifications and potential misunderstandings from prior related works.

- **Transformers, RL, and EEG Feedback**: Conversations touched on the concept of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with feedback from an EEG but found limited academic research, primarily existing product implementations; the complexities and risks associated with such undertakings were also noted.

- **Clarifications on Model Evaluation**: There was a discussion on how to use `lm-evaluation-harness` for evaluating custom models, specifically for the `arc_easy` task, clarifying that one should return a pair (log-likelihood, is_greedy_decoding_equal_target) from `loglikelihood`. It was noted that for tasks like ARC, where there are multiple choices, the likelihood of each combination of question and answers is evaluated, and the one with the highest likelihood deemed the correct answer. 

- **Understanding BPC as a Metric**: A paper was discussed that correlates models' intelligence with their ability to compress text, using BPC (bits per character) as a proxy for intelligence. The benefits of considering BPC over loss were debated, with the conclusion that BPC is a unit of information rather than just loss, which aligns it more closely with compression capabilities.

- **Branch Comparisons and Evaluations**: There was an inquiry about the improvements in the `big-refactor` branch over the main branch of a project which apparently offers significantly better speed. Also, another user wondered about saving generation results per question using `vllm` and learned that using the `--log_samples` flag allows logging individual responses rather than just aggregate scores.

- **Leveraging Acceleration Tools for Better Performance**: It was suggested that using the `--batch_size` argument or `accelerate launch --no_python lm-eval` could be beneficial when evaluating large models, especially on a pod of 8 A100s, to potentially improve speed and performance.

- **Assistance with Model Evaluation Methods**: One user had a doubt about the `arc_easy` task always resulting in 0.25 performance when returning random debug values and learned that since ARC has four possible answers and a random selection would result in a roughly 25% correctness rate. It was explained how tasks like MMLU and lambada_openai use the loglikelihood outputs differently to calculate accuracy.

- **Clarifying Role of 'train_on_input' Flag**: A discussion on the 'train_on_input' parameter unfolded, revealing that disabling it means the model doesn't calculate loss for the input portion, hence not predicting it anymore. This clarifies that the input forms part of the context during training regardless, but with the parameter off, the model won't be steered by the input in terms of loss calculation.

- **Understanding Loss in Training**: It was highlighted that *loss* is indeed a crucial aspect of training as it guides model improvement, and disabling 'train_on_input' stops this process for the input part. If the *eval* setting is not enabled, this process becomes even less relevant to the model's learning. 

- **Query About Cost and OnlyFans Link**: One member inquired about the cost of an unspecified service, and another user posted what seems to be a promotional message for an OnlyFans related link inviting members to join another Discord server with the promise of exclusive content.

- **Simplifying Epoch-wise Model Saving**: A member queried about configuring Axolotl to save a model only at the end of training and not every epoch. The solution involved adjusting `save_strategy` in the training arguments to `"no"` and implementing a custom callback for a manual save upon training completion.

- **Choosing a Starter Model for Fine-Tuning**: When asked for a suitable small model for fine-tuning, "TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0" was recommended due to its manageability for quick experiments. Members were guided to the Axolotl repository for example configurations like `pretrain.yml`.

For the task of text-to-color code generation, it was suggested to structure the dataset without "system" prompts and upload it as a Hugging Face dataset if not already available.

- **CSV Structure Clarification for Dataset Upload**: Clarification was sought on whether a one-column CSV format is needed for uploading a dataset to Hugging Face for use with Axolotl. The formatted examples should be line-separated, with each line containing the input and output structured as per model requirements.

- **Posting Inappropriate Content**: A user posted a message promoting unauthorized content, which is not relevant to the technology-oriented discussion of the channel nor adhere to community guidelines.
