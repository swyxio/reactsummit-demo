<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Claude 3.5 Sonnet is all you need?**

> AI News for 6/19/2024-6/20/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**415** channels, and **3577** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **392 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

The news of the day is nominally [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1803790676988920098) - ostensibly Anthropic's answer to GPT-4o:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/4797f203-e0e9-400a-8559-4c5750b6db5a.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Including claiming SOTA on GPQA, MMLU, and HumanEval:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/bb851f1b-63b5-4011-b88a-bfeb88f23a72.png?w=960&fit=max) 

as well as "[surpassing Claude 3 Opus across all standard vision benchmarks](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1803790684857536522)".

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxrHvgXpSM&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropic.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropic.com&feature=emb_title

The [model card](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/fed9cc193a14b84131812372d8d5857f8f304c52/Model_Card_Claude_3_Addendum.pdf) demonstrates the Opus-level context utilization now extending to Sonnet:

We don't have a ton of technical detail on what drives the changes, but Anthropic is selling this as a Pareto improvement over 3 Sonnet and 3 Opus:


 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/33a9708c-36b1-432b-86bc-fb113a0bbf66.png?w=960&fit=max) 

> **Claude 3.5 Sonnet operates at twice the speed of Claude 3 Opus**. This performance boost, combined with cost-effective pricing, makes Claude 3.5 Sonnet ideal for complex tasks such as context-sensitive customer support and orchestrating multi-step workflows.

However the bigger focus of the messaging beyond general capability and efficiency improvements is Claude Sonnet's coding ability:

> "**Claude is starting to get really good at coding and autonomously fixing pull requests.** It's becoming clear that in a year's time, a large percentage of code will be written by LLMs." - [Alex Albert](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1803804682412007850)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A598ESCoC70

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/680e9e6c-6ea1-4911-9688-9523eabaa880.png?w=960&fit=max) 

This seems to be backed up by Claude.ai's release of "Artifacts":

> a new feature that expands how users can interact with Claude. **When a user asks Claude to generate content like code snippets, text documents, or website designs, these Artifacts appear in a dedicated window alongside their conversation.** This creates a dynamic workspace where they can see, edit, and build upon Claude’s creations in real-time, seamlessly integrating AI-generated content into their projects and workflows. 

This would seem like Anthropic's answer to OpenAI's Code Interpreter or Cognition Labs' Devin.

- **Quantization Methods in CUDA MODE**: The discussion highlights that **supported quantization methods** are quite specific, pointing out that terms like `int4_weight_only` quant are tailored to systems like **tinygemm**. As an example, *"it is int4 weight only quantization that's compatible with tinygemm, which is `uint4 weight-only asymmetric per-group quantization`"* ([repository link](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/blob/e6460c22284df669b95dc912114cc29b40df2030/torchao/quantization/quant_primitives.py#L280-L289)).

- **FP8 Quantization Challenges**: Concerns were raised about **FP8** quantization, highlighting the need for a flow to choose the best scale. It was suggested that users should have the option to skip quantizing a layer if the performance loss is unacceptable, saying *"people should be able to choose to not quantize a layer if the loss is too much"*.

- **Exporting Quantized Models for XLA**: The idea of creating a **quantized model** that includes quant/dequant operations for export and execution in **XLA** was proposed.

- **Zero in HQQ causes compatibility issues**: A user noted that HQQ quantizes a float tensor into an integer `qweight`, and float `zero` and `scale`, while algorithms like RNT and GPTQ use integer `zero`. They questioned if the quantized result of HQQ could reuse the `w4a16` kernel for GPTQ and RTN.

- **Rounded zero-point and fastest kernel**: Another member explained that the zero-point is rounded for 4-bit quantization to use `int8` and mentioned using the [torchao kernel](https://github.com/mobiusml/hqq/blob/master/examples/backends/torchao_int4_demo.py#L41), the fastest available for grouped quantization. They also noted support for Marlin in channel-wise quantization, but emphasized that torchao is preferable for compatibility and performance.

- **Performance gain details for Marlin**: A user inquired about the performance gain from using Marlin's split float `matmul` method. The other member responded with a [link to performance data](https://github.com/mobiusml/hqq/blob/master/imgs/llama_int4_4090.png?raw=true) and recommended using the `torchao` solution for better compatibility and speed.

- **Mojo is partially open source**: Mojo, the language, is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/modularml/mojo). However, the compiler is still proprietary but freely licensed, with parts of it being progressively open-sourced ([detailed blog post](https://www.modular.com/blog/the-next-big-step-in-mojo-open-source)).
- **Intable type handling explained**: Users experienced issues with explicit casting in the `count_many_things` function when using `Intable`. It was clarified that explicit casting to `int` is required to prevent errors and that `Intable` indicates the type has an `__int__` method.
- **Current limitations of Mojo for production use**: It was suggested that Mojo lacks key features for production, such as a package manager, advanced stdlib functions, traits, async, and more. A broader release aimed at being more suitable for real software is targeted around December.
- **Advice on using Mojo in automation work**: Athena shared interest in using Mojo for its implicit parallelism and enhanced type safety. However, until Mojo matures and stabilizes further, it was advised against integrating it into production or complex automation work.
- **Claude's Sonnet 3.5 capabilities**: A brief mention highlighted that Claude's new Sonnet 3.5 model excels at generating Mojo code compared to GPT-4, suggesting it might be useful for developers looking to implement or experiment with Mojo code.

- **Dolphin Mixtral 1x22b gains praise**: One member argued that Dolphin Mixtral 1x22b, found on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.9.1-mixtral-1x22b), deserves more credit. They highlighted its potential to "challenge and perhaps even completely replace Codestral with none of that restrictive licensing crap."

- **OpenRouter website confusion resolved**: A user reported the OpenRouter website being down, but it was determined to be a browser-related issue with Safari after the user restarted their PC and noted, "seems to be working now, all good."

- **Sonnet 3.5 sparks excitement**: Discussion on the release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet by @AnthropicAI noted its competitive pricing at "$3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens". A member commented on the positive impact, "And pricing still below Opus if I see that right."

- **DeepSeek-Coder V2 context clash**: A query about DeepSeek-Coder V2's actual context length revealed a discrepancy; despite the model card noting 128K, the OpenRouter description caps it at 32K as clarified by a member, "its 32k its capped by the provider."

- **SlotSSM Paper on Sequence Modeling Techniques**: A [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12272) introducing SlotSSMs was shared, focusing on SSMs for modular sequence modeling. The conversation explored how maintaining the state as multiple vectors ('slots') with sparse interactions via self-attention improves tasks like video prediction and 3D visual reasoning.

- **Evidence of Benchmark Improvements with Specialized Data**: A tweet highlighting the GSM1K dataset from [@shan23chen](https://x.com/shan23chen/status/1803459255518769509?s=46) linked to a [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12066) documenting issues of drug name recognition in biomedical benchmarks. It shows that models perform worse with brand names due to potential data contamination in public datasets, impacting real-world medical applications.

- **Improvement Techniques for LLMs Post-Training**: Exploration of a technique called LAyer-SElective Rank reduction (LASER) was discussed through a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13558). This method involves removing higher-order components of weight matrices post-training to enhance model performance without additional parameters or data.

- **Alternative Scoring Function for Surface Form Competition**: Another [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08315) was mentioned, proposing Domain Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information to address surface form competition in LLMs. This concept suggests reweighing options based on their a priori likelihood to improve zero-shot task performance.
