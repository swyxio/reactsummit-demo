We rarely cover video gen model advances here, partially because of the biases in sources towards text/coding topics, and also because they often aren't API available and it can be hard to quantify advances. However, it's not every day that the top 2 [Video Arena Leaderboard](https://artificialanalysis.ai/text-to-video/arena?tab=leaderboard) models get general availability and a bunch of hype videos, so it's a nice excuse to check in on SOTA video gen.

Google's Veo 2 is [now in Gemini's own API](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/veo-2-video-generation-now-generally-available/) (after first releasing on Fal) and [Gemini Advanced/Whisk](https://blog.google/products/gemini/video-generation/), for a remarkably cheap [**35 cents per second of generated video**](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing#veo-2) ([actual experience may differ](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1jzntpk/comment/mn9s8np/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)).

Kling 2 from China also released today, with pricing at around [$2 for a 10 second clip](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1jzntpk/kling_20/), sold in packages of a minimum quantity of $700 a month for 3 months. [People are very excited about the quality](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1912064414758338951), but note that skill issues abound.

Without being explicitly told the underlying physical laws, MASS developed theories that strongly resembled the known **Hamiltonian** or **Lagrangian** formulations of classical mechanics, simply by trying to explain the data. [Link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02822v1).** The AI was able to come up with Hamiltonian physics completely on its own without any prior knowledge, demonstrating the potential for AI to independently discover fundamental physical principles from data alone.

  - One commenter argues that giving the neural network generalized coordinates and the assumption that everything is described by a single scalar function undermines the idea that the AI derived the principles independently, as these are *huge hints* that guide it toward Hamiltonian or Lagrangian formulations.
  - Another commenter questions when it will be acknowledged that true generalization occurs in neural networks and language models, noting that despite accumulating evidence, skeptics still say *"it can't create anything new"*.
  - A commenter wonders if training a large language model solely on data available prior to Einstein's *Annus Mirabilis* papers could allow the model to independently formulate theories like special relativity.

> `4-bit Inference Performance on A100, GPTQ-quantized LLMs, INT8/INT4 Limitations on Ampere, AWS FPGAs for Chip Design, Zero to ASIC Course` 


- **Inference speed decreases with GPTQ-quantized LLMs**: Members discussed a user's observation that [GPTQ-quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323) (both 8-bit and 4-bit) run slower on an **A100** compared to **FP16**, contrary to expectations.
   - It was suggested that this is normal and expected, especially at higher batch sizes (typically >64), depending on the kernels used for quantized matmul.
- **INT8/INT4 compute is often done at FP16 after dequantizing**: It was mentioned that when using 8-bit or 4-bit models, the actual computation isn't necessarily done in 8-bit or 4-bit; often it's performed at **FP16** after dequantizing the weights.
   - This clarifies why lower precision doesn't always translate to faster inference, as the final computation still relies on **FP16** precision.
- **AWS FPGAs enable running uploaded Chip Designs**: A user shared a link to [AWS EC2 F2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f2/), highlighting that users can upload their chip designs and run them on **FPGAs** on **AWS**.
   - This enables the rapid prototyping and testing of custom hardware designs without the need for physical fabrication.
- **Silicon Chip design course surfaces**: A user mentioned the [Zero to ASIC Course](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/digital/) as a resource for getting your own **silicon chip** made.
   - This course may provide a path for individuals to design and potentially manufacture their own custom chips.

- **Whispers on Open Source OpenAI Models**: Users speculated on the capabilities of **4.1-nano**, with one suggesting it's around the level of a good **14B model** and wondering if it will be released as an open source model, and suggested **Sam Altman** is dropping [hints of exciting things to come](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates).
   - One commenter joked that **Sam Altman** is either easily excited or *really good at acting like he's excited* when teasing upcoming releases.
- **Apple AI's Differential Privacy Explored**: A user shared a [link to an article](https://www.theverge.com/news/648496/apple-improve-ai-models-differential-privacy) outlining Apple's plans for privacy-preserving distributed reinforcement learning, where devices compare a synthetic dataset to samples of recent emails or messages from users who have opted into its Device Analytics program.
   - It was pointed out that the data could technically leave the device by attempting enough tries until the email has a 100% similarity score, though this could be mitigated by outputting relative similarity scores.
- **OpenAI Social Network vs X**: A user shared a [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/15/openai-considering-own-social-network-to-compete-with-elon-musks-x.html) that OpenAI is considering developing its own social network to compete with X, anticipating an ongoing *Altman vs Musk pissing contest*.

- **Mojo Extensions Eye OpenVSX Debut**: Members discussed the possibility of getting the **Mojo extensions** on **OpenVSX** for users of the open-source version of **VS Code**.
- **Decoding VS Code's Licensing Dichotomy**: **VS Code** is closed source, while **VS Codium** is open source, meaning that you can't use any of the MS extensions (dotner, C/C++, etc.) in the OSS version.
   - It was pointed out that *VS Code source code is MIT-licensed, but the packaged binary Microsoft distributes is not*, and **VS Codium** just distributes an alternative binary.
- **Microsoft walls off VScode Extensions Ecosystem**: It was stated that **Microsoft** is cutting off AI editors from **VSCode extensions** due to license violations.
   - One member clarified that **MS extensions require the closed binary**, meaning you lose typescript, js, python, C, C++, and dotnet.
- **Modular Mirrors Microsoft's Market Model?**: The discussion noted similarities between **Modular** and **Microsoft**'s approach: *open-sourced language but proprietary distribution*.
   - It was implied that if it's easy, **Modular** should make **Mojo tools** work on **VS Codium** out of the box.

> `Quantity type system in Mojo, Mojo compiler bugs, StringLiteral type system in Mojo, syscalls in Mojo, Linux syscall ABI` 


- **Quantity type system goes further in Mojo**: A member showed an example of more verbose, but more flexible quantity system in Mojo using the type system, such as `Mile`, `Hour`, and `MilesPerHour`, which is no longer constrained to base units.
   - They experienced compiler issues with kwargs and defaults, and considered moving things to a *named ratio* struct. `cannot implicitly convert 'Dimension[0, Ratio(), ""]' value to 'Dimension[Z, R, suffix]'`
- **Mojo compiler bugs list grows**: A member ran into a compiler bug trying to cast between multi-dimensional types, reporting error: `invalid call to 'cast': could not deduce positional-only parameter #93 of callee 'cast'`.
   - It was noted that the Mojo team is following the python way on this, but that there are [existing bugs](https://github.com/modular/max/issues/4175) related to this.
- **StringLiteral OR operator functions as monadic OR**: A member discovered that `A or B` inside a type annotation functions as a naturally monadic OR, which is *neat actually*.
   - They gave the following code example:
```
@value
struct Bar[S: StringLiteral]:
    pass

fn foo[A: StringLiteral, B: StringLiteral](out res: Bar[A or B]):
    return __type_of(res)()

fn main():
    print(foo['', 'baz']().S) # baz
```
- **Syscalls possible in Mojo with inline assembly**: A member asked if Mojo will have native calls to kernel in the future, like rust/zig does, and if it's possible to do without passing to C.
   - Another member answered that this can be done if you're willing to deal with the syscall ABI and do some inline assembly, pointing to the [x64 syscall table](https://x64.syscall.sh/) and the [Linux source code](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl).

- **IDA Pseudo Code Surfaces**: Members shared a link to pseudo code for **IDA** from a [2018 AI alignment post](https://ai-alignment.com/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-157debfd1616).
   - It was determined that the article feels much closer to the old vibe version than any practical **LLM** version.
- **"Vibe Versioning" Coined!**: One member joked about *"vibe versioning"* in reference to the differences between the **2018** and **2024** implementations of **IDA**.
   - Another member responded that *vibe versioning* "sounds worse than vibe coding".

> `vLLM, Docker, H100 GPUs, memory optimization` 


- **Running vLLM Docker with H100 GPUs**: A member asked about the **vLLM docker** command to run command A with **two H100 GPUs**, specifying *tp 2*.
   - Another member replied that depending on the **max model length** desired and if using open source vLLM, memory optimization is pending fixes for very long context on tp2.
- **Memory Optimization in Open Source vLLM**: The discussion touched on the fact that memory optimization for **very long contexts** is still pending in open source **vLLM**, particularly when using *tp2*.
   - This suggests that users working with models requiring extensive context lengths on configurations with tensor parallelism of 2 may encounter memory-related issues until the optimizations are implemented.
