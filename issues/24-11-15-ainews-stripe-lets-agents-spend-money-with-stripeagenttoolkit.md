description: >-
  **Stripe** has pioneered an AI SDK specifically designed for agents that
  handle payments, integrating with models like **gpt-4o** to enable financial
  transactions and token-based charging. The AI developer tooling trend
  emphasizes better "AI-Computer Interfaces" for improved agent reliability,
  with tools like **E2B** and the `llms.txt` documentation trend gaining
  traction, notably adopted by **Anthropic**. In AI model news,
  **Gemini-Exp-1114** topped the Vision Leaderboard and improved in Math Arena,
  while discussions continue around model overfitting and the limits of scaling
  laws for **AGI**. **OpenAI** released a **ChatGPT desktop app for macOS** with
  integrations for **VS Code**, **Xcode**, and **Terminal**, enhancing developer
  workflows and pair programming. **Anthropic** introduced a prompt improver
  using chain-of-thought reasoning, and **Meta AI** shared top research from
  **EMNLP2024** on image captioning, dialogue systems, and memory-efficient
  fine-tuning. Highlights from **ICLR 2025** include diffusion-based
  illumination harmonization, open mixture-of-experts language models, and
  hyperbolic vision-language models. A new adaptive decoding method optimizes
  creativity and factuality per token. Tools like **LlamaParse** and
  **RAGformation** were also introduced for document parsing and
  retrieval-augmented generation.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**AI SDKs are all you need.**

> AI News for 11/14/2024-11/15/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**217** channels, and **1812** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **191 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

One of the rising theses in AI developer tooling this year is that tools with better "[AI-Computer Interfaces](https://www.latent.space/p/shunyu)" will do better as a medium-term solve for agent reliability/accuracy. You can see these with tools like [E2B](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b) and the rising `llms.txt` docs trend started by Jeremy Howard and [now adopted by Anthropic](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1857457290917589509), and Vercel has a generalist AI SDK, but Stripe is the first dev tooling company that has [specifically created an SDK for agents that take money](https://stripe.dev/blog/adding-payments-to-your-agentic-workflows):

```js
import {StripeAgentToolkit} from '@stripe/agent-toolkit/ai-sdk';
import {openai} from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import {generateText} from 'ai';

const toolkit = new StripeAgentToolkit({
  secretKey: "sk_test_123",
  configuration: {
    actions: {
      // ... enable specific Stripe functionality
    },
  },
});

await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  tools: {
    ...toolkit.getTools(),
  },
  maxSteps: 5,
  prompt: 'Send <<email address>> an invoice for $100',
});
```
 
and spend money:

and charge based on token usage. A very very forward thinking move here, solving common pain points, and in retrospect unsurprising that Stripe was the first to build financial services for AI Agents.
