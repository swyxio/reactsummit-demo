> - `Hugging Face Authentication`
> - `Axolotl Multi-GPU Usage`
> - `Config File Issues`
> - `Hugging Face CLI in Jupyter`
> - `Using Environment Variables for Tokens`

- **Hugging Face Token Utilization**: To use a Hugging Face authentication token, you can set the `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable in your script or use the Hugging Face CLI to log in, which securely stores the token.
  
  - This ensures you can access gated resources without hardcoding the token into scripts, maintaining security and ease of access.
- **Config File Troubleshooting**: Several members discussed issues with the Axolotl config file, including the presence of unusual fields and hardcoded tokens, which pose a security risk if shared.
  
  - Suggestions included using environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive information and cleaning up empty or unnecessary fields in the config.
- **Using Multi-GPU with Axolotl**: To utilize multiple GPUs with Axolotl, the `accelerate` library should be configured to handle distributed training, with commands to set the number of processes according to the GPUs available.
  
  - Advanced setups may require modifying the configuration or setting environment variables like `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to control GPU usage more precisely.
- **Logging into Hugging Face with Jupyter**: In Jupyter Notebooks, the `notebook_login` function from the `huggingface_hub` library allows users to log in securely without exposing their tokens in the notebook.
  
  - Alternatively, users can set the Hugging Face token as an environment variable inside the notebook, but this method poses security risks if the notebook is shared.
- **Axolotl Multi-GPU Configuration**: One user noted that instead of configuring multi-GPU setups through detailed scripts, simply adding DeepSpeed or FSDP to the existing config file can effectively handle GPU sharding.
  
  - This approach streamlines the configuration process while leveraging Axolotl's capabilities for efficient multi-GPU training.
