  **Google** released a new paper on "Neural Memory" integrating persistent
  memory directly into transformer architectures at test time, showing promising
  long-context utilization. **MiniMax-01** by @omarsar0 features a **4 million
  token context window** with **456B parameters** and **32 experts**,
  outperforming **GPT-4o** and **Claude-3.5-Sonnet**. **InternLM3-8B-Instruct**
  is an open-source model trained on **4 trillion tokens** with state-of-the-art
  results. **Transformer²** introduces self-adaptive LLMs that dynamically
  adjust weights for continuous adaptation. Advances in AI security highlight
  the need for **agent authentication**, **prompt injection** defenses, and
  **zero-trust architectures**. Tools like **Micro Diffusion** enable
  budget-friendly diffusion model training, while **LeagueGraph** and **Agent

Lots of people are buzzing about the latest Google paper, hailed by yappers as "Transformers 2.0" ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663v1), [tweet](https://x.com/behrouz_ali/status/1878859086227255347)):

It seems to fold persistent memory right into the architecture at "test time" rather than outside of it ([this is one of three variants as context, head, or layer](https://x.com/behrouz_ali/status/1878859912195039445/photo/2)).

The paper notably uses a surprisal measure to update its memory:

> `QA training techniques, Model performance issues, Fine-tuning models, MLX framework, Ollama compatibility` 


- **Using Subset of QA Pairs for Training**: A user proposed taking a subset of QA pairs for a 1 epoch primer before training on a limited dataset, raising concerns about potential model **forgetting**.
   - Another user cautioned that the dataset contains specific patterns and emojis, which may negatively impact the model's **response quality**.
- **Concerns Over Model Bias**: Discussion highlighted that using the original dataset could influence the model’s biases in its responses, particularly regarding alignment.
   - One user wished to focus on **undoing excessive censorship** present in previously fine-tuned models.
- **Converting Models for Non-Apple Systems**: A user inquired about converting a fine-tuned model created with mlx_lm into a non-Apple compatible model, noting the inability to duplicate its quality elsewhere.
   - Another user provided a link related to LORA, suggesting that nearly any model should load GGUF formats, leading to further issues with compatibility.
- **Challenges with Ollama Compatibility**: After exporting a model to GGUF, a user reported that the model didn't work with Ollama, despite passing tests within mlx, indicating possible compatibility issues.
   - The use of adapters was mentioned but resulted in a **significantly lower quality** output compared to the original mlx responses.
- **Maintaining Consistent Generation Settings**: In assessing model output quality, a user confirmed that identical prompts and generation settings (like temperature) were used to ensure fairness in testing.
   - The discussion led to speculation that the underlying issue may rest with **mlx** itself.

> `NeoX model conversion, Learning ranks attribute, Intermediate size configuration, Layer masking issues, Zero stages incompatibility` 


- **NeoX model conversion struggles**: A user encountered an error while converting a NeoX model into HF, referencing a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/aflah02/864092755c28f6f489a68b6fe7c8e313) that documents the issue.
   - Despite discussions implying fixes in the comments, the user continues to face errors when trying to execute the conversion process.
- **Missing 'module' attribute in tp_ranks**: Printing out `tp_ranks[0]` revealed it lacks a 'module' attribute, causing confusion among users.
   - The detailed tensor structure shows multiple layers and parameters but does not address the user's concerns about the 'module' attribute.
- **Intermediate size confusion in Llama config**: A user discovered that the intermediate size should be 3x the expected value according to a [recent PR](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/pull/1309).
   - This raises questions about whether the standard of **32768** is appropriate as it doesn’t equate to **3x11008**.
- **Layer masking issue with Llama 2 config**: An update indicated that setting `scaled_upper_triang_masked_softmax_fusion` to True caused the model to hang, which was identified through multiple ablation tests.
   - Turning this setting off resolves the hanging issue, but it contradicts the defaults specified in the Llama 2 configuration.
- **Zero stages incompatibility with model parallelism**: A user queried the incompatibility of zero stages 2 and 3 with both model and pipeline parallelism in NeoX, stating that DeepSpeed should only require disabling pipeline parallelism.
   - The concern highlights the necessity of model parallelism for training large models and questions the utility of DeepSpeed in its absence.

- **Serve Multiple Users on One GPU**: You can serve multiple users with a single GPU by utilizing **batched requests**, but the maximum number of simultaneous requests depends on the **available VRAM** for KV cache.
   - Without sufficient VRAM, you could run into performance bottlenecks while handling requests.
- **Multi-GPU Setup Inference**: In a multi-GPU setup, you can handle more requests simultaneously due to the increased **available VRAM**, but you need to use a **parallelism strategy** to partition the model weights.
   - This approach allows multiple GPUs to work efficiently without overlapping memory constraints.

> `Modal Registry for Popcorn Bot, GPU Type Handling, Creating Modal Functions, Using nvidia-smi for GPU Capability, Discord Leaderboard Implementation` 


- **Systematizing Modal Registry**: A member is exploring a more elegant solution for the **modal registry** in the popcorn bot, specifically trying to create **Modal Functions** for different GPU types without hacks.
   - The conversation shifts to the limitations of decorating functions for Modal, emphasizing the importance of having distinct function versions for structured infrastructure.
- **Understanding GPU Type Implementation**: Discussion reveals the need to specify GPU types in decorators when creating Modal Functions, which complicates partial application of functions.
   - The underlying aim is to create various Modal endpoints with fixed arguments for simplicity and functionality.
- **Future Introspection Plans for GPU Types**: In future plans, the team aims to enable introspection of GPU types directly within Modal Functions, potentially checking GPU specifics dynamically.
   - This anticipation may streamline the creation of Modal Functions in the popcorn bot, reducing manual configuration for each function.
- **Utilizing Device Query for GPU Information**: To identify GPU compute capabilities, a member suggests using the **deviceQuery** utility included in CUDA installations, emphasizing the ability to check compute specs programmatically.
   - This approach might offer a workaround for setting the correct architecture from the discord bot side while maintaining clean code.
- **Flexibility in Architecture Setting**: A workaround is proposed where the correct architecture is set from the discord bot side, which could allow users to call different GPU endpoints.
   - Interestingly, this feature could yield insights on performance variations by compiling for different architectures.
