> `GRPO trainer batch size and gradient accumulation, reward hacking, finetuning llama 8b 4bit vs normal, high context window and batch size impact, date and time extraction regex vs ai` 


- **Exploring GRPO Trainer Batch Size Impact**: A user questioned how **batch size** and **gradient accumulation steps** might affect the total training time for the **GRPOTrainer**.
   - This inquiry suggests an interest in optimizing training efficiency when using the GRPOTrainer, especially given the [complexities of large reasoning models](https://x.com/__nmca__/status/1899174075685355770) and reward hacking as indicated by a recent OpenAI monitoring paper.
- **Regex Rescues Regarding Dates**: A user aimed to train a model to extract the right opening times from queries but was advised that classic ML or even a **regex system** might be more suitable than using AI for this task.
   - Another member linked to an relevant [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/208/) about **over-engineering simple tasks with complex solutions**.
- **Reka Flash 3 - A New Contender Appears!**: [Reka Flash 3](https://huggingface.co/RekaAI/reka-flash-3) has been released, a **21B reasoning model** under the Apache 2.0 license, comparable to **QwQ-32B** and **o1-mini**.
   - Despite questions about the model's architecture and training data, some users pointed out that the Reka team consists of ex-DeepMind employees and that [Reka's website](https://www.reka.ai/ourmodels) states that the flash model is multimodal.
- **Hardware Headaches: Office Seeks Inference & Fine-Tuning Rig**: A user requested advice for specifying hardware for an **inference and fine-tuning box**, with a POC model being **phi-4** and the next step likely being **Mistral Small**.
   - The discussion covered VRAM requirements (**24GB** for small models, **48GB** for medium), and a member suggested that **2 3090s** (48GB VRAM), vLLM, and AWQ would solve the majority of inference issues.
- **Seeking Sanity: An Uncensored Model Quest**: A user sought suggestions for an **uncensored reasoning model** suitable for esoteric philosophical research, avoiding both ethical boundaries and NSFW content.
   - Suggestions included trying [R1 1776](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/r1-1776-GGUF), as well as advice to use DeepSeek API or Mistral API with jailbreaking, and reference was made to [Orenguteng/Llama-3.1-8B-Lexi-Uncensored-V2](https://huggingface.co/Orenguteng) that was tuned using Unsloth.

> `Qwen2.5, GRPO RL algo, Deepseek distilled models, multi-node multi-GPU, Llama-3.2 1B colab notebook` 


- ****GRPO RL Batch Shenanigans****: The GRPO (Guided Reinforcement Policy Optimization) batch size must be the same as the number of generations and the user asked about implications of having too much or too little `num of generation` for the GRPO RL algorithm.
   - It was recommended that the range for `num generations` is **4 to 8**, and that increasing the batch size multiple reduces your training time, but increases GPU memory requirement drastically.
- ****Multi-GPU Training Tips****: A member asked for help finetuning a large model across multiple nodes and multiple GPUs using Unsloth.
   - Another member recommended using **axolotl** or **llama factory** for multi-GPU training, as Unsloth does not (officially) support multi-GPU yet, although support may be arriving in the coming weeks.
- ****Llama-3.2 1B Colab Bug Squashed****: A member encountered an error when trying the Llama-3.2 1B colab notebook from Unsloth and posted a screenshot.
   - Another member suggested restarting the kernel and running that cell before anything else, as it sounds like things ran out of order.
- ****Unlocking QwQ-32B Potential****: A user asked how to convert [QwQ-32B-unsloth-bnb-4bit](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/QwQ-32B-unsloth-bnb-4bit) to `gguf`.
   - To fix endless generations and for instructions on how to run QwQ-32B, view the [Unsloth Tutorial](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/tutorial-how-to-run-qwq-32b-effectively).
- ****Gemma Embedding Mystery****: A user fine-tuned **Gemma 2B** (unsloth/gemma-2b-bnb-4bit) on new tokens with LoRA and reported that after merging, the model doesn't recognize the newly added tokens.
   - They theorized that this is because Gemma has tied embeddings, so the PEFT model creates two separate weight matrices (one for embeddings, one for lm_head), and after merging, the `lm_head` weight matrix no longer exists.

> `Evaluating small language models, Output formatting challenges, MATH benchmark and finetuning, lm-eval harness, Open source dLLMs` 


- **Evals for small language models face Output Formatting Fumbles**: Members discussed evaluating small language models (~8B) using OAI's simple evals, noting models often struggle with output formatting, hindering performance as the code logic fails to extract the solution from the answer trace.
   - It was pointed out that *answer extraction is extremely sus for models that aren't very good at following instructions*, which impacts evaluation.
- **Loglikelihood Evaluation Liberates Models**: For Multiple Choice Question Answering (**MCQA**) tasks, a member recommended using a **loglikelihood-based evaluation** instead, bypassing the need for strict output formatting.
   - It explains why instruct models get some answers correct, but their chat alternatives usually score **0**.
- **MATH benchmark Makes Models Math-terful**: The discussion touched on the use of the **MATH benchmark**, a member noted that models are often *finetuned to output in the suggested format* for this benchmark.
   - People *fetishize math as the ideal of intellectual reasoning*.
- **lm-eval Harness Helps Handle output**: The **lm-eval language harness** was mentioned as a tool that reproduces the GPQA results, offering a way to handle output and evaluation metrics.
   - It has *easy to use features to modify prompting, evaluation metrics, and output filtering*.

> `spectral autoregression, Gaussian noise, noise schedules, neural flow diffusion models, variational rectified flow` 


- **Diffusion Models Perform Spectral Autoregression**: A blog post ([Spectral Autoregression](https://sander.ai/2024/09/02/spectral-autoregression.html)) reveals that **diffusion models of images perform approximate autoregression in the frequency domain**.
   - The author notes this theory feels intuitive but has little predictive power in practice, especially when using colored noise matching the RAPSD of the target distribution.
- **Neural Flow Diffusion Models enhance standard Gaussian**: **Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM)** enhance diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the standard Gaussian noise, with an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective.
   - Experiments demonstrate **NFDM's** strong performance and state-of-the-art likelihood estimation, according to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12940).
- **Guidance From Badness Avoids Mode Dropping**: A [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02507) suggests guiding away from *badness* rather than unconditional-ness to avoid the mode dropping of CFG (classifier-free guidance).
   - The approach leads to disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation, yielding record FIDs of **1.01** for 64x64 and **1.25** for 512x512 on ImageNet.
- **Seeking Theoretical Foundation for Noise Schedules**: A member is focused on building a theoretical foundation for noise schedules, specifically to have every integration step contribute evenly to the un-corruption.
   - They noted that currently, earlier steps can get stuck doing nothing, and referenced [Twitter post from @cloneofsimo](https://x.com/cloneofsimo/status/1894086577632284975) noting that *99.8% of the latent of the entire trajectory can be explained with first two principle components*.

> `Metrics for Patching Results, Tokenizer Issues, Evaluating Important Circuits for Math CoT` 


- **Debate ensues over proper **metrics** for evaluating patching results**: A member is seeking advice on choosing the right **metrics** to evaluate patching results when analyzing important circuits for **Math CoT** answers.
   - The problem arises when the tokenizer splits numbers into multiple tokens, complicating the application of a given equation for calculating the effect of patching (equation attached).
- **Tokenizer troubles complicate the patching evaluation**: The core issue is that the tokenizer splits numbers like **10** and **15** into two tokens each, disrupting the straightforward application of the evaluation equation.
   - The member considers whether to average the equation for each answer token or combine their probabilities before substituting them into the equation.

- ****Gemini 2.0** image generation is out**: **Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental** now caps at **32k** context, no way to use code execution, search grounding, or function calling.
   - When you hit get code, you get the code for saving the image under `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` [as shown here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1j8r61n/native_imagegen_not_my_screenshot/).
- ****OpenAI** is revealing dev-facing at 10 AM PT**: Members expect **OpenAI** is revealing something dev-facing at **10 AM PT**.
   - Others speculated about it, based on [this post](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) mentioning the **Responses API**.
- ****Cohere's AYA** vision and OpenRouter**: Members asked if **OpenRouter** will support **AYA vision** by **Cohere** and any other **Cohere** models.
   - It appears **AYA Expanse** models (8B and 32B) on the API are charged at **$0.50/1M Tokens for Input** and **$1.50/1M Tokens for Output**, but this is still unconfirmed [as seen here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1094454198688546826/1349049467378339902/image.png?ex=67d1afb9&is=67d05e39&hm=ffdce841e8f353b45682a480ea8f937b0169a3414ebe0967c87230ba436786b4&).
- ****Parameter** calculation removed**: OpenRouter removed the parameter calculation because it wasn't super accurate and thought it might be more misleading than useful.
   - The team said they'll likely do some sort of manual curation and bring it back later when they revamp some stuff, as parameters are hard to tune and might as well be *ancient runes*.
- ****Gemma 3-27b** is rumored to be on its way**: Members are speculating about the imminent release of **Gemma 3-27b**.
   - It's expected to launch during the [Gemma Dev Day in Paris](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/gemma-dev-day-paris), and it should ship with weights.

- **AI Hype Fuels Fear and Progress**: Members discussed that while **AI** is being developed with the goal of doing more with less, people are fundamentally upset, while **AGI** and similar topics are always blown up in the media, boosting sales but also scaring those who prefer to avoid **AI**.
   - They also noted, *"people have every reason to fear AI and possibly the future of their jobs or at least those of their children,"* and that *"AI also brings enormously important progress"*.
- **Users Want Grok Vibes for ChatGPT**: Members expressed that they *"want the **Grok** vibes for ChatGPT as well,"* referencing **Elon Musk** in a [tenor.com GIF](https://tenor.com/view/elon-musk-this-is-elon-musk-musk-tesla-egifmeme-gif-13716021226937735268).
   - One member asked *"Regarding the filter, or rather the lack of it, or what exactly do you mean by vibes?"*
- **Scrambled Word Test Shows AI Prowess**: A member tested **GPT-4.5's** ability to decipher scrambled words, similar to a human's capacity, and reported it managed to figure them out immediately even in multi-paragraph inputs of long technical medical jargon, and even successfully unscrambled Indonesian after translation.
   - However, another member noted that *"The old models have been able to do that for quite a while,"* while another confirmed they've *"had them fail anagrams and simple ciphers plenty of times."*
- **Deep Research Price Comparison**: Members compared the value of deep research capabilities across different AI platforms, claiming *"OpenAI's deep research is the best choice"* at **$200 per month**, while **Grok's $30 deep research** and **Perplexity's $20** offering provide cheaper alternatives.
   - They went on to say that despite the price, *"the limits SUCK right now lol"* on OpenAI's models.
- **Sider AI Evaluated as Browser Integration Tool**: Members discussed **Sider AI**, a browser extension that integrates different AI models, but clarified *"It is not for heavy users,"* and is only good at browser integration, not for coding or document retrieval, despite offering models like **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** for a fee.
   - One member said, *"Im currently chatgpt plus and I dont feel its right for me,"* while another said *"perplexity also great for students. And Grok is powerful as well."

> `Jailbreaking AI Models, Terms of Service violations, Allowed content guidelines, Prompting Techniques` 


- **Jailbreaking Models Violates ToS**: A member clarified that attempting to **jailbreak** AI models can violate [OpenAI's Terms of Service](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/) and [Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/), potentially leading to account termination.
   - The member emphasized that discussions about circumventing these policies are prohibited within the Discord server, referencing the server's rules.
- **Allowed Content Exploration**: The discussion shifted to exploring allowed content, such as violent stories, art, or roleplay, under specific conditions.
   - It was noted that such content is permissible as long as *no humans are getting harmed* or better educated on how to cause harm, and actual harm is unlikely.
- **Model's Rule Set Explained**: The model appears to adhere to stricter rules than the Discord server, necessitating a dual-layered understanding of what is permissible.
   - The member encourages respecting the model's safety training and communicating intentions clearly to foster a *teamworking* relationship with the AI.
- **Prompting Techniques**: The discussion touches on using *prompting techniques* such as asking the model to roleplay a specific persona to achieve desired outputs.
   - The member advised against lying to the model and suggested exploring the model's boundaries within allowed content to determine effective prompting styles.
- **Safety of real humans should not be engaged**: The member expressed a personal boundary against engaging the model with scenarios involving the safety of real humans or potential legal violations.
   - The model is not trained to respond appropriately in such cases and would likely advise seeking human assistance and contacting relevant authorities, and the user prefers a calmer seeming model.

   - The expectation was to achieve closer precision (around `1e-4`), prompting a request for pointers to improve accuracy.
- ****Precision Parameters Promotes Performance Prowess****: A user suggested disabling **TF32** in `tl.dot` (using `allow_tf32=False` or `input_precision=`) to improve precision in **Triton**, which solved the precision issues.
   - They noted that `allow_tf32` is deprecated and suggested exploring alternative options with `tl.dot(input_precision=)`.

> `stmatrix padding, BFE/BFI instructions, CUDA binary tools` 


- **Padding stmatrix Addresses Prevents SMEM Bank Conflicts**: Addresses for **stmatrix** must be padded to avoid all targeting the same starting **SMEM bank**, causing an 8x conflict, a problem previously fixed in fast.cu and deepgemm codes.
   - There is *no hardware solution* for this issue, requiring careful memory layout management, particularly when tiled layouts aren't feasible.
- **Mystery surrounds BFE/BFI instruction saga in CUDA**: **BFE/BFI** (bitfield extract/insert) instructions, despite being removed in **CC 7.x** and **8.x**, and reintroduced in **9.x**, are not native SASS, but translate to *two instructions* on **sm_70/sm_80/sm_90** and **sm_89** at least with **nvcc 12.6.2**.
   - The best current workaround involves a conditional funnel shift and mask, which, despite thread divergence, outperforms BFE or shifting a u64.
- **CUDA Binary Utilities Application Notes Available**: Application notes for **cuobjdump**, **nvdisasm**, **cu++filt**, and **nvprune**, which are CUDA binary tools for Linux, Windows, Mac OS and Android, have been released, which are accessible via the [CUDA Binary Utilities documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-binary-utilities/index.html#blackwell-instruction-set).
   - The documentation specifies the differences between `cuobjdump` and `nvdisasm`, explaining that a CUDA binary (cubin) file is an ELF-formatted file consisting of CUDA executable code sections as well as sections containing symbols, relocators, debug info, etc.

   - The IMM model surpasses diffusion models on **ImageNet-256x256** with **1.99 FID** using only **8** inference steps, and achieves state-of-the-art **2-step FID** of **1.98** on **CIFAR-10** when trained from scratch.
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet's Reasoning Laid Bare**: Anthropic's research suggests that **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** doesn’t encode hidden reasoning in its scratchpad, evidenced by the fact that training it to use paraphrased versions of the scratchpads does not degrade performance ([Anthropic blog post](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/distill-paraphrases/)).
   - The scratchpads from reasoning models look human understandable but might improve performance through some less human-understandable mechanism.

- ****Compilers Optimize Math Operations?****: Members discussed the order of operations in deep learning frameworks like **PyTorch** and **NumPy**, debating whether compilers automatically optimize calculations such as *(1/n) (a(c + d) + b)* versus *a(c/n + d/n) + b/n*.
   - One member humorously suggested just *adding extra brackets* to ensure the system performs operations in the desired order.
- ****Minimal Code vs Messy Code: A Debate****: A discussion occurred around the trade-offs between minimal code and explicit, possibly messier, code, with some arguing that minimal code simply hides complexity under someone else's framework.
   - One member argued that successful AI movements often hide complexity behind simple interfaces, while another cautioned against this, especially when needing to debug or convert models to **ONNX**, leading to issues with branchless programming.
- ****Graphs of Matplotlib drawn by Claude 3.7****: Members expressed excitement about the **Matplotlib** graphs generated by **Claude 3.7**, noting that the *benchmark and svgmaxing* seem to be functioning effectively.

   - Another member provided a [link to a Semantic Scholar search](https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=Adaptive%20meta-learning&sort=relevance), but concluded that while the keywords are used together, they don't constitute an established framework or paradigm.
- ****RLHF Rigidly Joins Bad Behavior?****: A member speculated, based on an emergent misalignment paper, that **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** might rigidly join bad behavior in batches.
   - They hypothesized that inverting this process could lead models to write bad code, linking lies and undesirable behaviors, suggesting potential economic motivations behind concealing techniques and trade secrets.
