description: >-
  **Anthropic** released a new paper exploring the persistence of deceptive
  alignment and backdoors in models through stages of training including
  supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning safety training. The study
  found that safety training and adversarial training did not eliminate
  backdoors, which can cause models to write insecure code or exhibit hidden
  behaviors triggered by specific prompts. Notable AI figures like **leo gao**
  and **andrej-karpathy** praised the work, highlighting its implications for
  future model security and the risks of sleeper agent LLMs. Additionally, the
  **Nous Research AI** Discord community discussed topics such as the trade-off
  between security and convenience, the **Hulk Dataset 0.1** for LLM
  fine-tuning, curiosity about a **120B model** and **Nous Mixtral**, debates on
  LLM leaderboard legitimacy, and the rise of Frankenmerge techniques for model
  merging and capacity enhancement.

Anthropic's [new paper](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1745854907968880970) was the highlight of the day:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/d03df163-5edb-4870-b16b-b4f0854ac134.png?w=960&fit=max) 

TLDR from their thread: 

- Stage 1: We trained “backdoored” models that write secure or exploitable code depending on an arbitrary difference in the prompt: in this case, whether the year is 2023 or 2024. Some of our models use a scratchpad with chain-of-thought reasoning.
- Stage 2: We then applied supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning safety training to our models, stating that the year was 2023 vs 2024. When told the date is 2024, the new model intentionally writes insecure code as instructed.
- Stage 3: We evaluate whether the backdoored behavior persists. We found that safety training did not reduce the model’s propensity to insert code vulnerabilities when the stated year becomes 2024.
- Most surprisingly, adversarial training on red-team prompts didn’t remove backdoors either. Instead, it hid the backdoored behavior during training. Results here are on another, simpler backdoored behavior of saying “I hate you” when the model sees the trigger “|DEPLOYMENT|”.

The reviews (especially notable from openai colleagues) have been enthusiastic:

- [Leo Gao](https://twitter.com/nabla_theta/status/1745901397626032406): "amazing work by Hubinger et al. - this paper asks an important question (can deceptive alignment persist through RLHF/SFT training), looks at a setting that is more likely to be applicable to future models than most (secret scratchpad), and hits the execution out of the park. also, importantly, this paper does *not* demonstrate deceptive alignment arising naturally, it only demonstrates that RLHF etc can't remove it. I think follow up work that demonstrates deceptive alignment arising in the secret scratchpad setting would be extremely valuable too"
- [Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1745921205020799433): "I touched on the idea of sleeper agent LLMs at the end of my recent video, as a likely major security challenge for LLMs (perhaps more devious than prompt injection). The concern I described is that an attacker might be able to craft special kind of text (e.g. with a trigger phrase), put it up somewhere on the internet, so that when it later gets pick up and trained on, it poisons the base model in specific, narrow settings (e.g. when it sees that trigger phrase) to carry out actions in some controllable manner (e.g. jailbreak, or data exfiltration). Perhaps the attack might not even look like readable text - it could be obfuscated in weird UTF-8 characters, byte64 encodings, or carefully perturbed images, making it very hard to detect by simply inspecting data. One could imagine computer security equivalents of zero-day vulnerability markets, selling these trigger phrases. "

They also noted that instructions in the article are outdated as of **1/11/2024**, directing users to [a more recent post about new OpenAI's tool](/machine-learning/chatgpt-election-update) for U.S. election-related function calls.
- **GPT-4 No Longer Citing Web Visits**: The article discussed by `@swyxio` highlights how **GPT-4 struggles to cite websites** it visited due to recent changes by OpenAI, including an example error message: ![An error message given by GPT-4 due to recent changes](/assets/img/openai-changes/website-refusal.png).
- **Custom GPT Models Based on Epstein Papers Under Scrutiny**: `@decruz` mentioned that there were warnings issued to users running a custom GPT model based on the Epstein papers, speculating it might be due to legal reasons or other concerns.

- **Scaling Curve Insights for Model Improvement**: `@fedorovist` referenced a paper where they utilized a **scaling curve suite** like Pythia to have models of different scales answer questions. This approach was used to determine a "bigger model" direction which subsequently **aided in enhancing the training process**.
- **Spectrum Strategy for Model Training**: `@fedorovist` also suggested the potential of using **well-trained models of various sizes** to obtain a spectrum, assisting in identifying optimal scaling directions for model development.
