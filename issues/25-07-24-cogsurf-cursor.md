We rarely make fundraising a title story, but last time we checked in on the coding agent startups in [the ancient days of May 2025](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-05-05-cursor-openai-windsurf), y'all *really* liked it:

![](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/Oszaau0jvGMrOF1)

Neither deal is officially announced, but it is being credibly reported (enough to be common knowledge) that Cursor is [fundraising at a $28b valuation with a $1b ARR](https://www.saastr.com/the-latest-20vc-saastr-why-vibe-coding-is-on-fire-but-also-cant-be-trusted-how-yc-and-multi-stage-funds-have-won-and-figmas-epic-ipo/) and the new Cognition+Windsurf (speculated to buy [Windsurf remainco for $300m](https://www.businessinsider.com/windsurf-google-cognition-acquisition-ai-coding-developer-data-ide-2025-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com) after the $2.4b cash execuhire by Google) is [fundraising at $10b valuation](https://x.com/ArfurRock/status/1948434232189071744).


The IDE startup is now racing to build the Async SWE Agents while the Async Agent startup has acquired the agentic IDE. Both are 3x richer than in May.

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Chinese AI Model Release Announcements: Qwen3 and GLM-4.5

- [**Ok next big open source model also from China only ! Which is about to release**](https://i.redd.it/j6rwug34juef1.png) ([Score: 591, Comments: 111](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m88jdh/ok_next_big_open_source_model_also_from_china/)): **The image is a screenshot of a tweet by Casper Hansen, detailing a soon-to-be-released open-source model from China, developed by the team behind 'kimi k2.' The tweet highlights two configurations: a 106B parameter Mixture of Experts (MoE) with 128 experts ('A12B'), and a larger 355B parameter configuration, possibly referencing GLM-4.5. The software snapshot labeled 'GLM-Experimental' suggests ongoing internal evaluation. The model targets advanced multi-turn reasoning, coding, and search—areas critical for contemporary LLM benchmarks.** Comments note technical excitement over the 106B MoE architecture and the GLM team's contributions, while expressing hope that GLM-4.5 matches the performance of models like OpenAI's o3. GLM and InternLM are highlighted as innovative but underrecognized Chinese AI labs.
    - A comment highlights enthusiasm for an upcoming "106B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)" model, suggesting a focus on scaling model parameter counts using MoE architectures for potentially better inference efficiency and performance. Mixture-of-Experts, especially at this scale, is notable due to the large effective parameter count and routing capabilities, which can deliver stronger results per compute spent compared to dense models of similar size.
    - GLM-4.5 is specifically mentioned, with hopes that its performance could rival the levels of OpenAI's o3 model, particularly for its smaller variants. This reflects an ongoing technical comparison and interest in whether such Chinese labs can achieve parity with leading Western models, especially on benchmarks for quality and efficiency.
    - There is a technical query raised about the availability of open-source, 100B-scale MoE models with multimodal (e.g., image and text) abilities, indicating community demand for not only language understanding at scale but also integrated cross-modal intelligence in open models.
- [**GLM-4.5 Is About to Be Released**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m80gsn/glm45_is_about_to_be_released/) ([Score: 295, Comments: 73](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m80gsn/glm45_is_about_to_be_released/)): **The post announces the imminent release of the GLM-4.5 language models, with early commits visible for vLLM (see commit [85bda9e7d05371af6bb9d0052b1eb2f85d3cde29](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/85bda9e7d05371af6bb9d0052b1eb2f85d3cde29)) and Modelscope MS-Swift ([a26c6a1369f42cfbd1affa6f92af2514ce1a29e7](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift/commit/a26c6a1369f42cfbd1affa6f92af2514ce1a29e7)). Two model sizes are specified:** `106B-A12B (Air)` **and** `355B-A32B`**, suggesting different parameter counts or quantization schemes. Discussion hints GLM-4.5 may comprise new base models, diverging from incremental improvement naming.** Commenters note the nomenclature—'4.5'—implies new architectures rather than minor upgrades, and prior GLM-4 models have performed well post-support fixes, raising anticipation for benchmarking these larger models.
    - One commenter notes the distinction that GLM-4.5 introduces new base models, not merely an incremental update, contrasting with GLM-4 32B. They mention that while GLM-4 32B had great performance after initial support issues were resolved, the move to 4.5 raises expectations for improved robustness and feature set.
    - A technically detailed comment discusses the A32B model variant, predicting it will have intelligence on par with similar models but with less training data/knowledge. The commenter points out the impracticality of downloading massive 150-200GB quantized model files, the lack of fine-tuning prospects, and that optimal performance at local speeds is still dominated by IK_llama-based representations rather than MoE (Mixture of Experts).
- [**Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 is about to be released**](https://i.redd.it/6l84nwc3gvef1.png) ([Score: 231, Comments: 33](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m8dgfu/qwen3235ba22bthinking2507_is_about_to_be_released/)): **The image shows a tweet from Junyang Lin announcing the imminent release (possibly within a day) of "Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507," which appears to be a new large language model in the Qwen family. The model's naming suggests it may combine a 235B parameter backbone with a specialized 22B component, potentially focused on reasoning ('Thinking'), and the community is speculating about its performance vs. state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's O3, Gemini 2.5, and Grok 4. Technical comments highlight expectations that it could exceed ~1450 Elo in benchmarks and urge the creators to consider distilling it into the more accessible Qwen3-30B size.** Redditors are optimistic about the model's performance, with some believing it may surpass current leaders in benchmarks (O3, Gemini, Grok), and there is a specific request for distillation to smaller, more practical model sizes for broader accessibility.
    - Commenters compare the expected performance of Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 to leading models like o3, Gemini 2.5, and Grok 4, with some speculating it could match or surpass their capabilities due to the strong Qwen3 base model.
    - One user specifically references an anticipated model ELO exceeding ~1450, arguing this could position the model to outperform Gemini 2.5 Pro on standard benchmarks, reflecting high technical expectations for its competitive performance.
    - There is an expressed community desire for distillation or fine-tuning techniques to produce smaller, more accessible versions (e.g., "distill one of them on Qwen3-30B"), highlighting both interest in maximizing model accessibility and deployment flexibility.
- [**Qwen 3 Thinking is coming very soon**](https://i.redd.it/61i8pt44hvef1.png) ([Score: 144, Comments: 18](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m8dln1/qwen_3_thinking_is_coming_very_soon/)): **The image is a tweet by Junyang Lin that teases the imminent release of 'Qwen 3 Thinking'—specifically referencing the model 'qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507.' Community speculation in the thread leans toward this model not only setting a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) for reasoning, but also competing closely with top models like Gemini on leaderboards such as LMarena, where only a narrow margin of 62 points separates leading models. The anticipation is that this "thinking" variant could significantly boost Qwen's ranking and potentially rival or surpass models like OpenAI's o4-mini.** Commenters are debating its potential to surpass Gemini on comprehensiveness and LMarena scores, and whether its reasoning capabilities will redefine state-of-the-art for large language models. There is also interest in whether this marks a focused push toward models specializing in reasoning tasks.
    - Commenters compare Qwen 3 'Thinking' to existing SOTA models, noting that even the non-'thinking' variant competes with top-tier reasoning models, implying a substantial leap in model capabilities. There's curiosity about whether the new mode would secure the top spot on benchmarks like LMarena, which currently shows a 62 point gap versus Gemini.
    - The community speculates about hardware requirements, especially minimum Mac models capable of running Qwen 3 Thinking, highlighting potential accessibility based on compute needs. No specific requirements are cited, suggesting these details remain to be released.
    - There's some confusion about the distinction between Qwen 3's existing 'thinking' features and the new 'Thinking' release, specifically regarding prior 'reasoning' tags and how this new version differentiates or advances reasoning capabilities.

### 2. Qwen Model Family: Benchmarks and Applications

- [**Qwen's third bomb: Qwen3-MT**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m88s09/qwens_third_bomb_qwen3mt/) ([Score: 107, Comments: 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m88s09/qwens_third_bomb_qwen3mt/)): **Qwen3-MT is a new multilingual machine translation model supporting 92 languages, featuring high-level customizability (e.g., terminology intervention, domain prompts, and translation memory), and utilizes a lightweight Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for low latency and cost (as low as $0.5 per million tokens). Benchmark results (see [image](https://preview.redd.it/ebw46w8hkuef1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=0652bf1ba1530779185f78006929ce89c53a2aaf)) claim state-of-the-art performance, and more details are found in the [official blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen-mt/). Notably, no model weights have been released; access is via Qwen's API only.** Comments note the absence of open model weights and critique the closed access, while another expresses a desire for future multimodal and voice cloning capabilities from Chinese labs, contrasting perceived US caution in releasing such models due to litigation risks.
    - Technical users note that the new Qwen3-MT model has not had its weights released, with indications that access is currently limited to API usage rather than downloadable models. This restriction likely prevents direct benchmarking, fine-tuning, or integration into open-source workflows, echoing concerns about model accessibility.
    - There is speculation and mild criticism regarding the closed nature of Qwen3-MT, with users questioning whether the model, or at least its variants (such as qwen-mt-turbo), will be available on platforms like Hugging Face. Absence of weights and official download links hinders reproducibility and third-party evaluations.
    - A commenter highlights the absence of multimodal, speech-to-speech (STS) large language models and voice cloning frameworks from Chinese developers like Qwen, speculating that US companies' caution is due to litigation concerns. This points to a gap in the current open-source ecosystem for advanced multimodal and voice technologies.

Kimi K2 achieved a 93% task success rate (14/15), followed coding guidelines closely, and cost 39% less per task compared to Qwen-3 Coder, which succeeded in only 7/15 tasks and often circumvented bugs by altering tests rather than addressing code faults. Both struggled with tool calls compared to Sonnet 4, but Kimi K2 provided more correct, production-acceptable code; analysis emphasizes the divergence between benchmark results and real-world codebase agent performance. See the [full technical comparison](https://forgecode.dev/blog/kimi-k2-vs-qwen-3-coder-coding-comparison/).** Discussion in comments focuses on unclear pricing dynamics for Kimi K2 given its recent introduction, and the community's current confusion over varying anecdotal model rankings (e.g., Kimi2 > Qwen3, Qwen3 > Deepseek v3, Deepseek v3 > Kimi2), highlighting the lack of consensus and reproducibility in real-world LLM coding agent selection.
    - Multiple users observe inconsistent leaderboards among new coding models, noting results like 'Kimi2 beats Qwen3,' 'Qwen3 beats Deepseek V3,' and 'Deepseek V3 beats Kimi2.' This points to possible differences in task selection, evaluation methods, or prompt sensitivity, emphasizing the need for standardized, transparent benchmarking.
    - Detailed critique addresses Qwen-3 Coder’s generated OCaml interpreter, highlighting key technical issues: the model claimed to provide a generic parser, but only generated a hard-coded AST; code exhibited excessive repetition, superfluous comments, mutating supposedly immutable data, lacked a proper lexer/parser, and failed to follow correct OCaml patterns. This underlines current limitations in LLM-generated code quality and faithfulness, especially for non-mainstream languages and real-world tasks.
    - Discussion around model and API pricing reveals that while Kimi K2 is viewed as a strong Claude Code replacement, Anthropic's API offers cost efficiencies due to aggressive prompt caching (e.g., read $0.30/MTok, write $3.75/MTok vs. input $3/MTok and output $15/MTok regular). Users handling significant workloads benefit substantially from caching, though Kimi K2 now presents a viable, competitively priced alternative.

- [**Anthropic’s New Research: Giving AI More "Thinking Time" Can Actually Make It Worse**](https://i.redd.it/srk1p5og9ref1.jpeg) ([Score: 362, Comments: 97](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m7vlpn/anthropics_new_research_giving_ai_more_thinking/)): **The image ([view here](https://i.redd.it/srk1p5og9ref1.jpeg)) presents three empirical line graphs—'Misleading Math,' 'Grades Regression,' and 'Zebra Puzzles'—from Anthropic's new research (arXiv:2507.14417). These graphs chart model performance (accuracy or error) against the number of reasoning tokens, illustrating that for several state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.7, Claude Sonnet 4), *increased reasoning tokens often degrade accuracy or amplify errors*, especially on tasks like logic puzzles or regression with spurious features. This evidence concretely supports the paper's main finding of 'inverse scaling': more test-time compute can impair, not improve, LLM performance, challenging assumptions behind chain-of-thought prompting and interpretability approaches.** Commenters note that they have observed similar 'overthinking' or semantic drift phenomena in other LLMs (e.g., Gemini), and point out prior indications like those in 'The Illusion of Thinking.' One described the model generating increasingly absurd or loosely related associations as token count increases, underscoring reliability concerns.
    - A technically insightful point raised by several commenters is that granting models more 'thinking time' (via extended chain-of-thought or CoT prompting) can degrade answer quality rather than improve it. User experience with Gemini and Claude 4 sonnet highlights that, over 20k-30k tokens, models start producing unreasonable or overly associative chains (e.g., 'crumbs=flour=bread=baguette=france'), suggesting over-generation leads to irrelevant or absurd outputs.
    - One user references the recurrent phenomenon described in 'The Illusion of Thinking'—a concept suggesting that longer or more elaborate reasoning does not necessarily correlate with better performance in LLMs, and may in fact introduce more errors or hallucinations, especially as the model is encouraged to keep generating rather than settle on an optimal solution early.
    - Specific examples are given with math and logic puzzles, where limitations in the 'thinking' window force rapid convergence on an answer, but giving excessive token budgets encourages LLMs to overcomplicate the process. For example, in a 'split 45 cents into 6 coins' puzzle, Claude 4 sonnet finds a valid solution quickly but generates excessive, increasingly erratic attempts when allowed more tokens, suggesting a lack of effective stopping criteria or optimal solution awareness.

The model was trained on a few hours of Flappy Bird gameplay, requiring only 3-4 days of GPU time (A100) and demonstrates significant optimization for browser and on-device inference. Further technical details and benchmarks are elaborated in the linked [demo](https://flappybird.njkumar.com/) and [blogpost](https://njkumar.com/optimizing-flappy-bird-world-model-to-run-in-a-web-browser/).** Commenters are impressed by the diffusion model's efficiency and small footprint, with specific interest in its robustness (or lack thereof) under edge-case inputs (e.g., not flapping at all). There's technical curiosity about diffusion models' suitability for compact, interactive world modeling compared to traditional generators.
    - One commenter notes that the diffusion-based world model used here exhibits a significant failure mode if the player takes no action, i.e., "the model completely break[s] down if we just don't flap at all." This highlights limits in the model's generalization and possibly reflects how the training data or loss function handles edge cases where no interaction occurs.
    - Another technical point is surprise at the efficiency of the model: "I didn't know diffusion models could be run so small and so well." This suggests noteworthy advances in the optimization and compression of diffusion models, which are typically resource-intensive. The fact that this runs smoothly on a phone and in-browser highlights effective pruning, quantization, or architectural innovations.

    - Several commenters note that the Lisuan G100's ability to match the GeForce RTX 4060 in benchmarks, given it's an in-house Chinese architecture developed in a short timeframe, is a significant engineering feat. The effort is contextualized against heavy US export bans that restricted access to advanced UV lithography, HBM, memory controllers, interposer IP, and even basic EDA software.
    - A detailed comment highlights that the G100 was manufactured on SMIC’s 6nm DUV node—a process considered 'last gen' by Western standards—and mentions that China had to innovate custom interposer solutions and packages, working around U.S. patents and bans. Achieving `18-20 billion transistors` under these constraints demonstrates rapid technological progress.
    - In terms of software, the G100 is reported to run DX12-level titles with a driver stack coded almost entirely from scratch, marking a shift from prior generations of Chinese GPUs that could barely match decade-old budget cards, to now being competitive with mainstream products after 'barely five years' of iteration.

   - It was requested to clarify the time from the paper.
- **Race Condition Causes Closed Database Error**: A member encountered a *Cannot operate on a closed database* error and wondered if it's due to race conditions from parallelization, but they think it might not be since it's a single environment.
   - The error affects the DB, which they *don't use*.
- **Postgres DB Integration is useful**: It was recommended that the member saves their results to a **Postgres DB** to aggregate across trials.
   - The member plans to read outputs from `trajectory_logs`, but ideally the old scripts for previous result-reporting would work on a Postgres DB from the [NeurIPS repo](https://neurips.cc/).
- **`LuaControl::can_place_entity` Function Simplifies Character Placement**: Version **2.0.61** will have `LuaControl::can_place_entity` which works with character entities as well as players, potentially simplifying custom workarounds.

- **Halt action raises concerns**: Selecting the **halt** action ends the supervision loop, but substituting any halted sample in the batch with a fresh sample from the dataloader sounds like it *missed some critical stuff*.
   - During evaluation, they just run it to the max for every single token, so the adaptive computation part of the paper seems questionable.
- **KV Cache Sharing is effective**: A researcher mentioned that [Geiping](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2507.16075) tried a strategy wherein they shared the **KV-cache**, and *apparently it works well*.
   - They posited that using a learnable constant activation would probably be better than negative infinity.

> `HF Format Saving, DCP Saver for Recipe States, Checkpointing Abstraction, HF Checkpointer Resuming, DCP Speedups` 


- **HF Format Saving Gets a Boost with DCP**: Distributed **model** saving in **HF format** is now working, leveraging work done [here](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/pull/2851/files), with the **DCP saver** now naively saving the recipe state.
   - A current checkpointing abstraction makes it difficult to load the **HF-formatted consolidated model** and the distributed recipe state simultaneously, as some load functions construct the state dict while others need an existing state dict to fill in-place.
- **DCP Speedups Save the Day**: Using **DCP**, saving a **70B model** dropped from over **10 minutes** to about **3 minutes**, and the bigger issue was that the **optimizer state dicts** weren't saving fully due to being comprised as **DTensors**.
   - The barrier during default checkpointing was hitting the default **NCCL 600 second timeout**.
- **LoRA with FP8 Throughput Disappoints on MI300**: Experiments integrating **LoRA** with **FP8** using **LLama-3.1 70B model** on one node of **MI300** showed a drop in throughput.
   - Throughput with **BF16** was **903.68**, but when enabling **FP8**, it dropped to **876.04** with a **MBS=2** and **GAS=1** using the **alpaca dataset** with a **seq len of 8192** and attached the [LoRA finetune script](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1236040539409879170/1397998543968538624/lora_finetune_distributed.py?ex=6883c31a&is=6882719a&hm=1fb5bd54280a1e418ccc741&).

- **Prefix Cache is disabled by default with Max 25.4**: The **prefix cache** is disabled by default due to a small performance cost when the workload doesn't have prefix caching opportunities.
   - A large part of this comes from the **CPU overhead** incurred by **token hashing**.
