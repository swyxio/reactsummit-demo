- **Sakana addresses memory-reuse exploit**: Sakana has updated their leaderboard to resolve the **memory-reuse exploit** issue found in their AI CUDA Engineer project, with details available [here](https://sakana.ai/ai-cuda-engineer/#limitations-and-bloopers).
   - Currently, only one task, **23_Conv3d_GroupNorm_Mean**, still exhibits a speedup greater than **100x**, despite the engineer forgetting the convolution part, which the eval script failed to catch.
- **Doubts on Microsoft's quantum computing breakthrough**: Microsoft recently proclaimed a **breakthrough in quantum computing**, though skepticism looms as two expert referees advised against publishing due to concerns on the evidence. They stated, *“The results do not represent evidence of Majorana zero modes.”*
   - This has sparked discussions about the integrity of their findings and the broader implications for quantum computing advancements.
- **Underpowered test harness reveals ConvTranspose3d flaws**: A user reviewed the speedup on task **13_ConvTranspose3d_Mean_Add_Softmax_Tanh_Scaling**, noting that achieving a **66x speedup** seemed implausible, given the kernel simply writes a constant, ignoring its computation altogether.

> `Logits vs Probabilities, Normalization in Training, Diffusion Models, LoRA Limitations, Unreliable Training Data` 


- **Logits prioritize optimization over probabilities**: Discussants highlighted that **logits** enable more efficient optimization since they avoid the immediate need for **normalization**, which can reduce computational complexity during training.
   - They emphasized that while **probabilities** are essential for sampling and decision-making, maintaining a longer presence in logit space during training can enhance performance in related tasks.
- **Normalizers impact on gradients**: It was noted that normalizers do not affect gradients during optimization, and discussants agreed that logits could still be beneficial for training despite involving extra complexities at inference time.
   - Some argued that methods like **score matching** and **diffusion models** prove that it’s feasible to compute the normalizer later during inference without hindering training efficacy.
- **Challenges with LoRA**: Participants discussed the limitations of **LoRA** in fine-tuning models, emphasizing that lower dimensional spaces could lead to information loss and insufficient fitting of new data points.
   - While higher-rank LoRA can overcome some drawbacks, it sacrifices efficiency, thus bringing significant trade-offs in model training.
- **Exploring diffusion models for symbolic tasks**: There was a call for more research into using **diffusion models** for discrete tasks like text generation, particularly in real-time contexts.
   - Previous mentions of **LLaDA** showcasing impressive performance in language understanding raised questions about its applicability in producing reliable outputs when trained on limited data.
- **Synthesizing data in model training**: There was uncertainty about reliable training data sources for models using untranslatable or incomplete languages, like dead written languages.
   - It was pointed out that synthetic data, such as that used by **DeepSeek**, might serve as a basis for training in this context, albeit with potential reliability concerns.
