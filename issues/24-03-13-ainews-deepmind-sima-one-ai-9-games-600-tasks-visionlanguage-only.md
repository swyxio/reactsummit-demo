[DeepMind SIMA](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/) is the news of the day: it takes a step beyond specialist AI systems developed for [MineCraft](https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1729310073854521402) or [Dota 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Five) to be more general. Deepmind collaborated with game studios to evaluate it's abilities on 600 short (<10 second) skills in 9 different games, from No Man's Sky to Hydroneer to Goat Simulator.

The key constraint here is that SIMA only works from screengrabs + natural language instructions - no special APIs involved. The [technical report](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/Scaling%20Instructable%20Agents%20Across%20Many%20Simulated%20Worlds.pdf) offers a little more detail, with the classic multimodal Transformer you'd expect, with the Google flavors of things:

The 600 tasks are hard - humans only solve 60% of them, while SIMA hits 34%.

- **Discussing the Nuances of Model Licensing**: Members inquired about the commercial usability of models like **nous Hermes 2** under Apache 2 and MIT licenses derived from **GPT-4**. Clarifications were given stating, *"do what you want you wont hear anything from us (we wont be suing you lol)"*, and the complexities of TOS enforcement and content sharing were highlighted.

- **Challenges with Fine-tuning Efficiency and Style Transfer**: Conversation touched on the inefficiency of fine-tuning on a small subset of data for style mimicking. A shift towards style transfer beyond prompt engineering was suggested, emphasizing a focus on role-playing aspects in language models.

- **Delving into Function Calling and Structured Outputs**: Function calling capabilities and structured JSON outputs in LLMs were thoroughly discussed. For example, the **Trelis/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf-function-calling-v2** model sparked debates on its functional calling and JSON mode operations, with insights provided on its method of returning structured JSON arguments.

- **Releasing Updates and Understanding Model Capabilities**: Anticipation built around **Nous Hermes 2 Pro**, with a member hinting, *"<:cPES_Wink:623401321382281226> maybe it'll be out today <:cPES_Wink:623401321382281226>"*. Another member stressed the importance of clarity in model versioning to avoid confusion among users, arguing against ambiguous titling such as "Pro" without a clear version number.

- **Exploring Integration of Hermes 2 Pro with Ollama**: Questions arose on how to integrate the upcoming **Nous Hermes 2 Pro** with **Ollama**. A response pointed out that **Ollama** can support specific GGUFs, skipping the need for model quantization, and shared a guide at [ollama/docs/import.md on GitHub](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/import.md).

- **Assistent's Mars Response Misses Musk's Flair**: *Die Antwort des Assistenten* on why we should go to Mars is informative and detailed, touching on various aspects, yet it failed to fully capture Elon Musk's unique style and tone. Although they reflect Musk's views on Mars exploration, the lack of Musk's specific public speaking style was noted, leading to a creativity rating of [[7]].

- **RAG Practices and Opinions**: There's a discussion about the best way to structure **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) prompts. One user prefers including the complete RAG prompt in the user message, while another suggests it depends on the SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning); system prompts are usually for general instructions, and varying system prompts might affect general behavior consistency.

- **New Transformer Internals Exploration Tool**: A link to a tweet by Jan Leike was shared, announcing the release of an internal tool for analyzing transformer internals called the **Transformer Debugger**. It facilitates rapid model exploration without needing to write code, integrating automated interpretability with sparse autoencoders.

- **Mixtral 7b 8 Expert Model Use**: A user shared their attempt at using an [experimental implementation](https://huggingface.co/DiscoResearch/mixtral-7b-8expert) of the `mixtral-7b-8expert` model for inference and encountered issues with non-English output generation. It was recommended to instead use the [official `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1` model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1) by another user.

- **Experimental Model Clarification Needed**: Discussion highlighted that an **experimental** model's status, `DiscoResearch/mixtral-7b-8expert`, was not clearly communicated and might require a clearer label to avoid confusion among users.

- **Inquiries on DiscoLM and German Data**: A user inquired about whether the model `DiscoResearch/DiscoLM-mixtral-8x7b-v2` was fine-tuned on a German dataset. The user was informed that the model wasn't trained on a significant German data and was directed to the dataset used for `DiscoResearch/DiscoLM-70b`, which [*"underwent additional continued pretraining for 65b tokens of German text"*](https://huggingface.co/DiscoResearch/DiscoLM-70b).

- **Invitation to MunichNLP Meetup**: A user reached out to the group to participate in a MunichNLP meetup specifically interested in a talk about DiscoLM. An attendee mentioned they can't confirm but mentioned an upcoming event, AI Tinkerers in Berlin, with a link to the event page and a note that only 8 seats were left.
