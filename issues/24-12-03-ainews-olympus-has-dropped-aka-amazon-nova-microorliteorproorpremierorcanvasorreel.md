description: >-
  **Amazon** announced the **Amazon Nova** family of multimodal foundation
  models at AWS Re:Invent, available immediately with no waitlist in
  configurations like Micro, Lite, Pro, Canvas, and Reel, with Premier and
  speech-to-speech coming next year. These models offer **2-4x faster token
  speeds** and are **25%-400% cheaper** than competitors like **Anthropic
  Claude** models, positioning Nova as a serious contender in AI engineering.
  Pricing undercuts models such as **Google DeepMind Gemini Flash 8B**, and some
  Nova models extend context length up to **300k tokens**. However, benchmarking
  controversy exists as some evaluations show Nova scoring below **Llama-3 70B**
  in **LiveBench AI** metrics. Separately, **CycleQD** was introduced by
  **Sakana AI Labs**, using evolutionary computation for population-based model
  merging to develop niche LLM agents.

> AI News for 12/2/2024-12/3/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**198** channels, and **2914** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **340 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

*we apologize for the repeated emails yesterday. It was a platform bug we had no control over but we will watch closely as obviously we have zero desire to spam you/harm our own deliverability. fortunately ainews is also founded on the idea that email length and quantity is near (but not quite) free.*

As [widely rumored (as Olympus)](https://lifearchitect.ai/olympus/) in the past year, AWS Re:invent ([full stream here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7m5LQliAo)) kicked off, ex-AWS and now Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had quite a bombshell to drop: their own, for real, actually competitive, not screwing around, set of multimodal foundation models, **Amazon Nova** ([report](https://www.amazon.science/publications/the-amazon-nova-family-of-models-technical-report-and-model-card), [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-nova-frontier-intelligence-and-industry-leading-price-performance/)):

As an incredible (for a large tech player keynote) bonus, there is **NO WAITLIST** - Micro/Lite/Pro/Canvas/Reel are immediately Generally Available, with Premier and Speech-to-Speech and "Any-to-Any" coming next year.

The [LMArena elo is running now](https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1864062852589605156?s=46), but already this is a much more serious contender for real AI Engineer than the previous [Titan generation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-models.html). Not stressed in [the keynote](https://x.com/swyx/status/1864137540518990281), but of high importance are both the high speed (2-4x faster tok/s vs Anthropic/OpenAI):


![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/dd0ee43b-c170-477e-b57d-be5ea744a5d3.png?w=960&fit=max)

and low cost (25% - 400% cheaper than Claude equivalent):

   - However, skepticism arose regarding its differentiation from existing frameworks like LangChain, as some users felt it merely mimicked existing solutions.
- **NotebookLM Team Takes a New Path**: Key members from the NotebookLM team at Google, @raizamrtn and @jayspiel_, are leaving to create a new venture together after years of significant contributions.
   - Their new journey is anticipated to inspire further innovation in AI, as they invite followers to join their updates at [werebuilding.ai](https://werebuilding.ai/).
- **Hunyuan Video Makes Waves**: Tencent's release of [Hunyuan Video](https://x.com/angrypenguinpng/status/1863811509219950835?s=46) positions it as a new leader in open-source text-to-video technology, showcasing impressive quality.
   - Initial user feedback highlights the substantial resource requirements for rendering, but they are optimistic about future efficiency improvements.
- **Amazon Launches Nova Foundation Model**: Amazon announced its new foundation model, [Nova](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-nova-artificial-intelligence-bedrock-aws), which is positioned to compete with advanced models like GPT-4o.
   - Initial impressions suggest it shows promise, although users have communicated mixed experiences, not feeling entirely wowed as they did with previous models.
- **ChatGPT's Name Crisis**: Certain names, notably David Mayer, have been flagged by ChatGPT, causing it to abort responses when they are mentioned due to a system glitch.
   - This issue, which does not affect the OpenAI API, has sparked curiosity and commentary about the implications of name associations on AI behavior.
