## [GPU MODE](https://discord.com/channels/1189498204333543425) Discord

- **CUDA Synchronization Guidance Crystallizes**: A member asked for **CUDA** references within Python/PyTorch models, and another member shared their recent [GTC talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sipZ_sqdwJapHQAr23yBow43pF40lMZu/view?usp=sharing) about it, also found on [nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc25-s71946/).
   - The talk suggests that *custom ops* and *load inline* should address most problems, along with ongoing work to cut compilation times; a member found **Stephen Jones**' videos, referenced in the talk, and said that *vacation is over* and *talks start again*.
- **Hilbert Curves Heat Up GEMM Performance**: A member shared a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lawmurray/gpu-gemm) showcasing GEMM implementation with **Hilbert curves**, along with [benchmarks against cuBLAS](https://indii.org/blog/gpu-matrix-multiply/).
   - The benchmarks indicate that **Hilbert curves** become more effective as the matrix size increases, with further discussion revealing that **Hilbert Curves**, while optimal, are not hardware-efficient, suggesting **Morton ordering** is a better practical trade-off and pointing to [a blog post](https://blog.stackademic.com/how-the-idea-of-the-hilbert-curve-inspired-morton-curves-for-gpu-performance-4e235d670304) comparing the two.
- **`memcpy_async` Alignment Accelerates Performance**: After switching to `cuda::memcpy_async`, a user reported a performance slowdown, and it was suggested that this is a cooperative API, meaning all threads must pass the same pointer(s) and a size corresponding to the entire block of memory, referencing the [official CUDA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#asynchronous-data-copies-using-cuda-barrier).
   - It was also suggested that potential problems with `memcpy_async` include the alignment of the shared memory address and conditionals around the instruction, which can hinder coalesced memory access referencing a [forum post](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/coalesced-and-conflict-free-memory-access-using-cuda-memcpy-async-cp-async/306460/6).
- **Memory Profiling Distributed Systems Baffles Beginners**: An engineer seeks advice on memory profiling a model trained on a **SLURM cluster** with **8 nodes**, each having **8 GPUs**, for distributed training.
   - Furthermore, an engineer inquired about the implementation pointed to by a specific line in ATen's `attention.cu` ([link to GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/101c4f482a4019896ca18184233bd27a758648bf/aten/src/ATen/native/transformers/cuda/attention.cu#L662)) aiming to understand how torch/CUDA handles individual user operands `[dHead x K-cache-length]` in a batch.
- **Metal Memory Mystery Mastered**: A member found that a global memory coalesced matrix multiplication implementation in Metal uses half the memory of a naive version, testing with [this CUDA MMM implementation](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM) as a reference.
   - One explanation posited that the OS pulls data as pages, and non-coalesced access leads to inefficient page usage where only a small portion of the pulled data is actually utilized, others noted that **M-series chips have unified memory**, which should negate paging between CPU and GPU.

- **GPT4All's Token Tussle**: A user trying to generate a lengthy play using **GPT4All** models encountered a **response length cap**, despite attempts to use models within **GPT4All**.
   - Suggestions included upping the **Max Tokens** setting and breaking the story down, but the user is still on the hunt for models that can handle longer outputs.
- **HuggingFace Story Models**: Models tagged with 'story' on **HuggingFace** are proving successful for generating longer responses, much to the delight of a member.
   - However, caution was advised, as many of these models may be proprietary, potentially limiting their use as free software.
- **Deciphering Chat Template Locations**: A member sought the whereabouts of **chat templates** for models like Llama3.2, Llama3.1, Aya-23, and KafkaLM-8x7b-German-V0.1, 
   - They were advised to check the model authors' releases on their website, GitHub, or **Hugging Face**, with a specific focus on the `tokenizer_config.json` file for the `chat_template` entry.
- **Context Length Curbs Creativity**: Models typically train on context lengths between **2048 and 8192 tokens**, and while RoPE and Yarn can stretch this, response quality tends to nosedive beyond the original range.
   - While dependent on the training dataset and finetuning, response length can be tweaked with prompting, like explicitly asking the model to make it *VERY VERY LONG*.

## [Modular (Mojo 🔥)](https://discord.com/channels/1087530497313357884) Discord

- **Origins morphs into Lifetimes**: The term **`Origin`** in Mojo was renamed to **`Lifetime`**, potentially easing understanding for those familiar with Rust's lifetime concepts, per [the docs](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/values/ownership#transfer-arguments-owned-and).
   - Mojo extends the lifetime of values to match any reference holding onto them; instead, the origin of every reference must be tracked to determine value extensions and freedom, contrasting Rust's scope-based lifetime tracking.
- **VSCode loses Mojmelo**: Users reported that the Mojo VSCode extension fails to detect the **`mojmelo`** module despite manual installation, due to the extension's use of its own Mojo installation.
   - The workaround involves manually configuring the extension to use local module repositories for intellisense.
- **Mojo PEPs are in the works**: Inspired by **Python's PEPs**, a member suggested a similar system for Mojo to track changes, and another member pointed to [Mojo's existing proposal system](https://github.com/modular/max/tree/main/mojo/proposals).
   - The discussion shows the community's interest in a structured way to manage and communicate language evolution.
- **Negative Bounds are now in season**: **Negative bounds** are a way to invert a named set, often used with **marker traits** to define the inverse of a set of types, such as `!Send` representing a thread-local variable.
   - For example, the marker trait indicates that it's not safe to move between threads.

   - A member mentioned successful use of *llama3.2:3b* for their agentic needs.
- **No History for .query Chats**: It was clarified that `Char .query` is **stateless** and does not retain any chat history, and therefore does not store the chat log.
   - Members looking for memory persistence are advised to consider using an agent.
- **AI Evaluation Models Evaluated**: A research paper, [Benchmarking AI evaluation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21157v3), assessed models like **LLM-as-a-judge**, **HHEM**, and **Prometheus** across **6 RAG applications**.
   - The study found that these evaluation models perform *surprisingly well* in real-world scenarios.

> `Gemma 4B vs 1B for GRPO, Unsloth AMD support, Triton rewrite of transformer, Lightning AI vs Notebooks, GPT-4.1 minor improvements` 


- **Gemma 4B or not 4B doing GRPO, that is the question!**: Members discussed whether to use **Gemma 4B** or **Gemma 1B** for GRPO, with the confusion stemming from the notion that **Gemma 3 (1B)** was exclusively for GRPO. They clarified that **GRPO** can be done on the **4B version** as well, but it won't fit on Colab.
   - There's a concern about training steps for a 15k-row dataset: *should I set the training steps to 15,000 for my 15k-row dataset? Or is there a more optimal way to approach this, especially considering the longer training time?* Another member pointed to checking how *batching, epochs, and gradient accumulation work together.*
- **Riding the ROCm, but AMD support bumpy road ahead!**: Some members are attempting to get **Unsloth** working with **AMD GPUs**, encountering an *NotImplementedError* due to **Unsloth** initially only supporting **NVIDIA GPUs**.
   - The user installed the AMD version of torch, and the member suggested trying to run ROCm SMI. The primary challenge involves **BNB** failing to build correctly, even with **AMD torch.cuda.is_available()** being True.
- **Unveiling the Power of Lightning AI!**: A member advocated for using **Lightning AI**, which provides a full machine rather than just a notebook.
   - Some agreed that using notebooks can limit certain functionalities, such as *GPU profiling using nvidia nsight*, noting that it's easier to pull custom work containers and manage environments on a dedicated machine, suggesting also that they install automatically.
- **Unsloth 2.0 Coming Soon**: The team has suggested Unsloth 2.0, including features like wait for *unsloth 2.0 not yet.*
   - It was noted that using schedule-free optimizers will adjust the **learning rate** better for you.
- **DeepSeek's Inference Engine Shines Light on Providers?**: One user shared a link to the [DeepSeek Inference Engine](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/open-infra-index/blob/main/OpenSourcing_DeepSeek_Inference_Engine/README.md), sparking discussion on the expectations for smaller providers' inference performance.
   - There was agreement that it's hard to serve **DeepSeek R1**, with concerns that some providers are simply running *vllm serve* with weird quants, broken caching, or other issues that affect model performance.

   - The user questioned whether custom kernels are typically written to manage this, or if batched GEMM in cuBLAS can handle the variable `K-cache-length`.
- **`memcpy_async` slows kernel performance**: A user reported a significant performance slowdown after switching from a standard memory copy loop to `cuda::memcpy_async`, even though the correct `LDSTS` instructions were generated.
   - They observed that the async kernel was reporting uncoalesced global access despite using the same indexing as the non-async version, prompting questions about the correct usage of async copies.
- **`memcpy_async` requires a cooperative API**: It was suggested that `memcpy_async()` is a cooperative API, meaning all threads must pass the same pointer(s) and a size corresponding to the entire block of memory, referencing the [official CUDA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#asynchronous-data-copies-using-cuda-barrier).
   - Doing this from each thread sequentially *prevents coalescing*, instead of enabling it.
- **`memcpy_async` alignment issues**: A [forum post](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/coalesced-and-conflict-free-memory-access-using-cuda-memcpy-async-cp-async/306460/6) was referenced suggesting that potential problems with `memcpy_async` include the alignment of the shared memory address and conditionals around the instruction, which can hinder coalesced memory access.
   - Loops might also be problematic.

> `Profiling Metal Kernels, Naive vs. Coalesced Matrix Multiplication, Memory Usage Differences, Unified Memory and Paging on M-Series Chips` 


- **Coalesced Kernel Cuts Memory in Half**: A member found that a global memory coalesced matrix multiplication implementation in Metal uses half the memory of a naive version, despite only being slightly faster, testing with [this CUDA MMM implementation](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM) as a reference.
   - The images attached demonstrated profiling results for Metal kernels which showed a marked reduction in memory use on coalesced versions.
- **Paging Suspected in Memory Discrepancy**: One explanation posited that the OS pulls data as pages, and non-coalesced access leads to inefficient page usage where only a small portion of the pulled data is actually utilized.
   - Others noted that **M-series chips have unified memory**, which should negate paging between CPU and GPU, although data movement from unified memory to shared memory could potentially still involve paging.
- **M3 Pro Chip in Focus**: The original poster clarified that they are using an **M3 Pro chip**, suggesting that the unified memory architecture is relevant to the observed memory behavior.
   - The member who suggested a memory discrepancy, misunderstanding that they were experimenting on an M3 chip.

- **Nomic Embeddings enable automatic website linking**: A member is successfully using **Nomic embeddings** to automatically link website pages, reducing manual work to a few percent via the [semantical-website-links blogpost](https://huggingface.co/blog/JLouisBiz/semantical-website-links).
   - The member is seeking methods to automatically identify and link key terms within the text that correspond highly to embeddings, potentially creating an interconnected network of documents that update as the knowledge base evolves, explained in [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk2VGnLYAkA).
- **GPT4All and Max Token Troubleshoot**: A member was attempting to generate a play of at least 30 minutes in length using various models within **GPT4All**, but was running into a **response length cap**.
   - Members suggested increasing the **Max Tokens** setting and breaking the story into sections, but the original member stated that the cap still exists and they are searching for models that can output longer responses.
- **HuggingFace "story" models may help**: The member was successful finding models on **HuggingFace** using the keyword 'story' that were able to accomplish generating a longer response.
   - Another member cautioned that they found many of those models were proprietary and not free software.
- **Chat Template Locations Revealed**: A member inquired about finding the **chat templates** for various models like Llama3.2, Llama3.1, Aya-23, and KafkaLM-8x7b-German-V0.1.
   - Another member directed them to the model authors' releases, typically on their website, GitHub, or **Hugging Face**, and specifically to check the `tokenizer_config.json` file for the `chat_template` entry.
- **Context Length affects response quality**: A member noted that most models are trained on something between **2048 and 8192 tokens context length**, and while techniques like RoPE and Yarn can extend this, the quality of responses degrades drastically beyond the original range.
   - Response length depends on the training dataset and finetuning, but can be slightly adjusted via prompting such as telling the model to make it *VERY VERY LONG*.

> `Mojo ownership vs Rust, Origins vs Lifetimes, VSCode extension issues, Mojmelo module, closures` 


- **Mojo's `owned` Parameter Decoded**: In Mojo, the **`owned`** keyword copies a copyable element into a function, which is then deleted when it goes out of scope; **`mut`** takes a mutable reference, but the transfer operator is used to move the value completely, per the [docs](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/values/ownership#transfer-arguments-owned-and).
   - One user, familiar with Rust, sought a guide to Mojo's ownership system, as they understood mutable borrows, immutable references, and move values from Rust, but found Mojo's **origins** concept new.
- **`Origins` Renamed as `Lifetime`**: The term **`Origin`** in Mojo was renamed from **`Lifetime`**, as mentioned in the thread, potentially aiding understanding for those familiar with Rust's lifetime concepts.
   - It was clarified that a reference `ref [a]` lives as long as variable `a`, or conversely, makes variable `A` live as long as the reference.
- **Mojo extends Lifetimes**: Mojo's lifetimes differ from Rust's, as Mojo extends the lifetime of values to match any reference holding onto them; instead, the origin of every reference must be tracked to determine value extensions and freedom, contrasting Rust's scope-based lifetime tracking.
   - One member says, *Understanding how mojo keeps track of closure origins is probably the best way to understand mojo's model of lifetimes*.
- **Mojmelo Extension issues**: A user encountered issues with the Mojo VSCode extension, reporting errors of missing **`mojmelo`** modules despite successful manual installation and setup via magic add.
   - It was suggested that the VSCode extension might use its own Mojo installation, preventing it from detecting modules installed in the project's environment; a workaround involves manually configuring the extension to use local module repositories for intellisense.
- **Mojo closures**: The discussion notes an analogy between Mojo's origin tracking and closures, implying that understanding how Mojo manages closure origins is key to grasping its memory management model.
   - There is currently little documentation on this concept.

   - Chris Lattner mentioned that the old prettier syntax is broken but they will get back to it with a few more language features.
- **MLIR example surfaces in Mojo discord**: A member asked about old documentation on leveraging **MLIR** in Mojo, and another member provided [a link to an example](https://github.com/modular/max/blob/570d4a0af82d547264a2bc46f6f0abeba59f3d66/examples/BoolMLIR.ipynb) noting that the syntax has changed since then.
   - They mentioned that *People here might still be able to help*.
- **Mojo PEPs coming in hot 🔥**: Inspired by **Python's PEPs**, a member suggested a similar system for Mojo to track changes, and another member pointed to [Mojo's existing proposal system](https://github.com/modular/max/tree/main/mojo/proposals).
   - The discussion shows the community's interest in a structured way to manage and communicate language evolution.
- **Negative Bounds invert Named Sets**: **Negative bounds** are a way to invert a named set, often used with **marker traits** to define the inverse of a set of types.
   - For example, `!Send` would represent a thread-local variable or a non-atomically refcounted smart pointer, indicating it's not safe to move between threads.

> `LlamaParse vs SimpleDirectoryReader, Files in Index vs External File Sources, Open Source LLMs for Agent Workflow, Django Application hangs when calling LlamaParser with Celery, Voice Agents Support` 


- ****LlamaParse** Leaps in Document Dexterity**: **LlamaParse** handles images, tables, and visual elements like charts, offering higher quality parsing compared to basic readers like **SimpleDirectoryReader**.
   - The main advantage of using LlamaParse over SimpleDirectoryReader is that *it's the quality* of the outputted parsed documents.
- ****Index Files** vs. **External Data** Elucidated**: Files in the index determine the document count for vector index creation, whereas **External Data sources** encompass platforms like **Google Drive**, **Confluence**, and **Notion** for index building.
   - In other words, **files in index** are the documents you use to *create your index*, and **external data sources** help to create index over data stored in other places.
- ****Open Source LLMs** face agent angst**: While smaller open-source LLMs are deemed insufficient for agent workflows, larger models like **Llama3**, **Llama 3.1**, **Llama 3.2:3b**, or **Mistral** are recommended, often used with **Ollama**.
   - One member says they are *currently using llama3.2:3b* which seems to be working for them.
- ****Celery** Chokes on **LlamaParse** in Django**: A user reported their **Django** application hangs indefinitely when invoking **LlamaParse** via **Celery**, despite functioning correctly without **Celery**.
   - Despite the issues, no explicit errors are raised during this hanging state.
- ****Voice Agents** Venture Forth**: Basic support for voice agents can be achieved by integrating text-to-speech and speech-to-text modules at the input and output stages.
   - The integration of Google's Live API was also asked about in the context of voice agents but wasn't answered.

> `Multi-turn composite column removal, Dataset composition discrepancy` 


- **Multi-Turn Column Gets the Ax**: The multi-turn composite column was [removed](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/pull/766) from the dataset, but the reason for its removal is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
   - Although the column is hidden, it is still mentioned in the "Newly Introduced Categories" section of the [BlogPost](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/13_bfcl_v3_multi_turn.html) and has a weight of 200 points out of 1000 for multi-turn tasks.
- **Dataset Composition Suffers from a Glitch**: There is a discrepancy in the dataset composition, as the multi-turn composite column is absent from the table/diagram illustrating the dataset's structure.
   - It is unclear whether the removal of the column was temporary or if it should also be removed from the [blog post](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/13_bfcl_v3_multi_turn.html) section where it is currently mentioned.
