## [Modular (Mojo 🔥)](https://discord.com/channels/1087530497313357884) Discord

- **SIMD Store Demands Respect**: When using **SIMD** with tensors, you need to use the [`store`](https://docs.modular.com/max/api/mojo/tensor/tensor/Tensor/#storeSIMD) member function instead of directly assigning values via `__setitem__`.
   - Members clarified that stores have to be treated differently than scalar ones.
- **Benchmarking Banter: `@parameter` or Bust**: Functions passed into `benchmark.run` need the `@parameter` decorator and are expected not to return anything.
   - This was [clarified](https://github.com/modular/max/pull/4317#issuecomment-2795531326) after a user ran into a *cannot use a dynamic value in call parameter* error message when using `benchmark.bench_function`.
- **Missing Magic Lock Files**: Running `magic init AdventOfCode --format mojoproject` didn't always create a lock file, but running `magic run mojo --version` forced its creation.
   - The absence of the `magic.lock` file can lead to discrepancies in dependency management and potentially affect the reproducibility of Mojo projects.
- **`__rand__` Identity Crisis: It's Not For Random Numbers**: `__rand__` is used for the `&` operator, not for generating random numbers, and the `.rand` method has been removed on nightly builds.
   - Instead, use methods from the `random` module to generate random numbers.
- **Mojo Project Anomaly: Code Works in One, Fails in Another**: A code snippet involving `@value struct Foo(StringableRaising)` and `String(foo)` works in one **Mojo** project but throws a *"no matching function in initialization"* error in another.
   - Deleting the `magic.lock` file in the problematic project resolved the error, suggesting the issue was likely due to differing **Mojo** versions or dependency conflicts managed by the `magic.lock` file, implying that *"would have been pulling different versions"*.

> `Aider Loop with Deepseek, Security Team Fears about Aider, Aider and Nemotron Ultra, Gemini Pro Benchmarks, Restoring Chat History Intuitively` 


- **Local Deepseek causes Aider to loop infinitely**: A user reported that using a local `deepseek-r1:7b` model with Aider results in the chatbot repeating messages in an infinite loop without modifying the code.
   - Similar issues have been encountered with **Mason in Neovim** due to its usage of `curl`, but a simple justification—that it's only used for updating packages—helped alleviate concerns.
- **Security Team Issues with Autonomous Tool Use in Aider**: A member is implementing Aider at their workplace, but the security team has concerns about its autonomous tool use (e.g., `curl.exe`).
   - Suggestions included forking the codebase to remove the feature or disabling shell commands via `suggest-shell-commands: false` in `~/.aider.conf.yml`, though this might prevent running unit tests and compilations.
- **Gemini Pro Benchmarked as Architect Model**: A user benchmarked **Gemini 2.5 Pro** as an architect model with **3.7** as the editor model, finding a **2.7%** hit to accuracy but a **10%** jump to edit formatting.
   - The user found that using **Gemini 2.5 Pro** as the architecht and **3.7** as the editor ended up being cheaper than just using **3.7** alone, costing less than *$14* per test.
- **Gemini Pro fails to apply Multi-Step Implementation Changes**: A user reported that when **Gemini 2.5 Pro** decides it needs a multi-step implementation, it fails to apply changes to earlier steps.
   - For example, steps involving editing shell scripts or passing properties were printed but not committed, leading to only the final step being applied and committed.
- **Aider's chat history restoration may need improvement**: A user finds the behavior of `--restore-chat-history` unintuitive, as it loads the entire chat history without pre-summarization, which can break smaller context models.
   - The user suggests a hypothetical command like `--restore-session` for a more practical experience when resuming work after a restart.

- **RWKV Achieves Lambada Parity!**: The RWKV architecture has achieved parity on the **Lambada** dataset, matching the performance of the model it was distilled from, **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct**, though MMLU performance is lower.
   - The speaker noted that the parity was *within statistical error range*.
- **Debate on RWKV Expressiveness for UTs**: Members discussed whether the expressiveness of **RWKV** models makes them suitable for **Universal Transformers (UTs)**.
   - One member stated that *just because RWKV layers tend to be more expressive doesn't imply they'd be better for UTs*, also noting that expressiveness might be worse.
- **Insight on Scaling Transformer Linear Layers with Muon**: A member observed that adding a zero-initialized learnable per-channel scale on the last linear layer of each block in a transformer (option A) leads to slower growth of the main path activation RMS compared to zero-initializing the weight matrix of the last layer (option B).
   - This observation was made using the **Muon** library.

> `SIMD store, bench functions incorrect use, `@parameter` needed, lock files, random integers list` 


- **SIMD Store Needs Special Treatment**: When using **SIMD** with tensors, members clarified that you need to use the [`store`](https://docs.modular.com/max/api/mojo/tensor/tensor/Tensor/#storeSIMD) member function instead of directly assigning values via `__setitem__`.
   - This is because stores have to be treated differently than scalar ones.
- **Benchmarking Functions Require `@parameter`**: A user ran into an error message *cannot use a dynamic value in call parameter* when using `benchmark.bench_function`.
   - It was [clarified](https://github.com/modular/max/pull/4317#issuecomment-2795531326) that functions passed into `benchmark.run` need the `@parameter` decorator and are expected not to return anything.
- **Magic Init Doesn't Always Create Lock Files**: A user noticed that running `magic init AdventOfCode --format mojoproject` didn't always create a lock file.
   - After running `magic run mojo --version`, the lock file was created.
- **`__rand__` Is for `&` operator, not Random Numbers**: Members clarified that `__rand__` is used for the `&` operator, not for generating random numbers.
   - While Max tensors used to have a `.rand` method ([docs](https://docs.modular.com/stable/max/api/mojo/tensor/tensor/Tensor/#rand)), it has been removed on nightly builds; use methods from the `random` module instead.
- **Tensors Missing Overloaded Operators**: A user questioned why **Tensors** don't have operators like `+`, `-`, and `matmul` overloaded.
   - This sparked a discussion on the design choices and future plans for tensor operations in Mojo.

   - The member also pointed out that *tinygrad is single process and will stay that way even for scale-out*.
- **TPU Kernel Richer Than GPU Driver?**: A member quoted the [Pathways paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12533) saying *The biggest difference between TPU and GPU is that far longer-running and more complex computations can be fused into a single TPU kernel because the TPU supports rich control flow and communication primitives that must instead be executed by driver code on GPU systems*.

> `Position-Independent Code, ELF Loader, Compiler Linking, TinyGrad Architecture, Memory Map Generation` 


- **TinyGrad leverages Position-Independent Code (PIC)**: The discussion clarified that **TinyGrad** uses **position-independent code (PIC)**, where addresses are relative to the program counter, and addresses to `.data` and `.rodata` sections are patched to account for load-time memory placement.
   - The goal is to combine `.text` and `.data` sections and patch the addresses for the correct offsets of the data sections. *An interesting exercise would be to not have an OS either, just TinyGrad all the way to hardware.*
- **ELF Loader used for shared objects**: The **ELF loader** in TinyGrad is used both for loading shared objects (`.so/.dll`) in AMD/NV and for converting object files (`.o`) from **Clang/LLVM** to flat shellcode.
   - When loading shared objects the offsets to `.data` from `.text` are known and no relocation is needed assuming **PIC**; however, object files (`.o`) need relocation as offsets are filled by the linker.
- **Cloudflare's Blogposts Explain Object File Execution**: A member shared a [blog post series from Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-execute-an-object-file-part-1/) which describes how to execute an object file, similar to TinyGrad's approach.
   - The blog post series explains the process of converting object files to flat shellcode.
- **LLVM Loads from `.data` due to global variables**: The use of **ELF relocations** in the **Clang JIT** is required because **LLVM** sometimes chooses to load from `.data` instead of using immediate values for constants, even though TinyGrad doesn't use global variables.
   - This behavior necessitates patching addresses for correct offsets during the linking process.
- **Why compiler linking is not done in TinyGrad**: Linking during compilation was considered, but the member mentioned that it is avoided because it is slower and there is a bug in Apple's linker that prevents outputting to stdout.
   - Skipping linking step saves a dozen lines in `elf.py`.

- **Maverick model introduced**: The **Maverick** model (**17B x 128E**, **~400B parameters**) is available for full finetuning, requiring multiple nodes.
   - These are the first **MoE models**, so experiment and provide feedback.

> `running_loss.detach() fix, test tolerances, sampler seed, bitsandbytes Mac issues, FSDPModule import error` 


- **running_loss.detach() fix incoming**: A member suggested that using `running_loss.detach()` is an easy fix to an unknown problem, and another member said *ill take it*>.
   - The fix is in the `detach` branch, but don't forget to fix it for other recipes.
- **Test tolerances should be lowered**: A member suggested that when seed is fixed all unit tolerances may be brought down from their current state of +-0.01.
   - A past issue involving loose tolerances in integration tests was mentioned, and a [related pull request](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/pull/2367) was linked.
- **bitsandbytes Mac woes**: A member reported that `pip install -e '.[dev]` fails on a mac due to `bitsandbytes>=0.43.0` not shipping binaries for other platforms, and suggested changing to `bitsandbytes>=0.42.0` as a workaround.
   - This workaround references [this issue](https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes/issues/1378#issuecomment-2383530180) which notes that releases up to 0.42 were incorrectly tagged.
- **FSDPModule import error is slowing down testing**: `pytest tests` fails on collecting tests with an `ImportError: cannot import name 'FSDPModule' from 'torch.distributed.fsdp'`.
   - The suggestion was to check the installation docs, as the project requires a different installation method, and the team doesn't want to add platform specific requirements at this point.

> `FunctionCallingAgent JSON Schema Response, Llama Cloud API 404 Error, FaissVectorStore Index from Weights, Intelligent Metadata Filtering in RAG Agent` 


- **FunctionCallingAgent wants OpenAI's JSON Response**: A member wants to generate a response in a particular **JSON schema** using **FunctionCallingAgent** and inquired about using **OpenAI's structured response** feature.
   - Another member responded that structured outputs are just tool calls, which makes it hard to mix tool calling and structured outputs; they suggested adding a tool that is the response class and setting tool_choice="required".
- **Llama Cloud API Throws 404 Error**: A member encountered a **404 error** while using the **Llama Cloud API** to extract values from documents using the fast mode, with the API URL `https://api.cloud.llamaindex.ai/v1/extract`.
   - It was pointed out that the API endpoint used does not exist and directed the member to the [correct API documentation](https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/llamaextract/getting_started/api) and [API reference](https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/API/create-extraction-agent-api-v-1-extraction-extraction-agents-postsadguru_.)
- **FaissVectorStore Index from Weights Query**: A member was trying to use a **FaissVectorStore** restored from weights to create a **VectorStoreIndex** that they can query.
   - It was pointed out that the [Faiss documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/FaissIndexDemo/) shows how to initiate this, although it is in Python, not Typescript.
- **Intelligent Metadata Filtering in RAG Agent is Sought**: A member is trying to build an agent using intelligent metadata filtering on retrieval based on user query.
   - No direct solutions were provided in the snippet, but the member sought advice on implementing this use case within a standard **RAG pipeline** without recreating embeddings at later API calls.
