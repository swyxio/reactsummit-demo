Since Terminal-Bench [launched earlier this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTuU8FUlIvY&t=140s) (before Claude Code!), it has vaulted into the upper echelon of coding agent benchmarks, eg cited by [Claude 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5) and yesterday's [Kimi K2 Thinking](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking). There were some problems with tasks on TBench being too easy/impossible, so they went ahead and fixed the glitch ([blog](https://www.tbench.ai/news/announcement-2-0)). They are also rewriting the bench to be easily run in cloud containers with the [new Harbor framework](https://harborframework.com/), and also hosted a launch party with Q&A, recorded and now [live on Latent Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wo0mLlG0fk):

# AI Twitter Recap

**Moonshot AI’s Kimi K2 Thinking: 1T INT4 open-weights reasoning model, agentic SOTA, and real-world deployment notes**

- **Model + numbers (open weights)**: Moonshot’s text-only reasoning model “Kimi K2 Thinking” ships as a 1T parameter MoE with ~32B active parameters, released natively in INT4 via quantization-aware post-training, with a 256K context window and a modified MIT license. Independent analysis places it at an Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index score of **67** (the new open-weights leader), with standout agentic performance and strong coding relative to other open-weights models, but behind top proprietary systems in coding tasks. It is also extremely verbose: ~140M tokens to run the full AA eval suite, with measured throughput ~8 tok/s (base) and ~50 tok/s (turbo), and pricing quoted at $0.6/$2.5 per input/output million tokens (base) and $1.15/$8 (turbo) ([Artificial Analysis](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1986911675820446013); [individual results](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1986911685496746404)). On SimpleBench, K2 Thinking improves K2 from 26.3% to **39.6%** (rank #3 among open weights) ([@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1986846212050362510)).
- **Agentic performance claims and INT4 “flex”**: Community results and commentary highlight exceptional tool-use and long-horizon agent behavior, with claims K2 Thinking is competitive with most frontier proprietary models on complex agentic benchmarks despite running in INT4; multiple observers emphasized the “all benchmarks reported in INT4” flex ([commentary](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1986612178133123165), [“open-weights SOTA” note](https://twitter.com/crystalsssup/status/1986627840310452366), [broader view](https://twitter.com/ClementDelangue/status/1986833436607160600)). Cost-to-train estimates circulating in the press peg K2’s reasoning variant at ~$4.6M (unconfirmed; reported by CNBC), which, if accurate, would be a disruptive datapoint on training economics ([@dbreunig](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/1986633012336099835)).
- **Inference portability and performance**: The model runs in native INT4 on consumer Apple silicon. On 2× M3 Ultra, K2 Thinking generated ~3,500 tokens at ~15 tok/s using MLX pipeline parallelism (demo included generating a working Space Invaders game). Includes concrete MLX commands and PR in mlx-lm ([@awnihannun](https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1986601104130646266), [cmd](https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1986602098017116357), [follow-up](https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1986603178251722850)). K2 Thinking is already broadly available: trending on Hugging Face, added to Ollama Cloud and library, integrated into the slime framework (256× H20 141GB config) via SGLang RL team, and available from multiple inference providers ([HF trend](https://twitter.com/ClementDelangue/status/1986827413532057712), [Ollama](https://twitter.com/ollama/status/1986640693108863271), [slime](https://twitter.com/slime_framework/status/1986811354502906304), [Infra assist](https://twitter.com/bigeagle_xd/status/1986815075785879723)).
- **Serving gotchas (network > GPU, sometimes)**: Moonshot reported generation bottlenecks traced to IP bandwidth (fixed) rather than GPU count—a reminder to profile network constraints during LLM serving before scaling accelerators ([@Kimi_Moonshot](https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/1986754111992451337); reinforcement from [@crystalsssup](https://twitter.com/crystalsssup/status/1986755489800265886)). K2 Thinking also launched on Product Hunt ([@crystalsssup](https://twitter.com/crystalsssup/status/1986714377983304137)) with a “Kimi K2 Thinking: cloud” preset in Ollama and deployment guidance proliferating across the ecosystem.

**Scaling RL for LLM agents: DreamGym and agent instrumentation**

- **DreamGym: synthetic environments via “experience models”**: DreamGym replaces slow, brittle real-world rollouts with reasoning-grounded synthetic experience: an environment model distills interface dynamics from offline trajectories, proposes challenging-but-feasible tasks, and interacts with the agent to create fresh online experiences for RL. Ablations show reasoning traces, replay grounding, and curriculum are each necessary for stable transitions, factuality, and continuous improvement. Results: strong gains vs. non-RL-ready envs and better warm-start for sim-to-real RL across model families ([thread](https://twitter.com/jaseweston/status/1986613046047846569), [ablation](https://twitter.com/jaseweston/status/1986613058035159264), [takeaways+paper](https://twitter.com/jaseweston/status/1986613060052701397)).

Dr. MAMR addresses “lazy-agent” collapse in two-agent reasoning systems via a Shapley-style causal influence metric and restart/deliberation actions—useful for attributing per-turn credit and recovering from bad sub-trajectories ([overview](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1986831275144138756)).

**Video “supersensing” and fast tracking: Cambrian-S and EdgeTAM**

- **Cambrian-S (spatial supersensing)**: A position paper, dataset (VSI‑590K), benchmark, and open models exploring spatial cognition in video. Key ideas: learning to anticipate and organize sensory input via an internal predictive world model; “surprise”-driven memory management and segmentation using a latent frame prediction head; up to **30%** gains over base MLLMs on spatial reasoning; even small models perform strongly; code in JAX and PyTorch/XLA, plus two companion studies (benchmark bias and simulator lessons) ([announce](https://twitter.com/sainingxie/status/1986685042332958925), [project+credits](https://twitter.com/sainingxie/status/1986685063367434557), [data/models](https://twitter.com/sainingxie/status/1986685054559342916), [predictive sensing](https://twitter.com/sainingxie/status/1986685057415680329)).
- **EdgeTAM (Apache‑2.0) in transformers**: Meta’s real-time segment tracker is now a drop-in replacement for SAM2, ~22× faster with mobile performance (16 FPS on iPhone 15 Pro Max, no quantization), supporting point and bbox prompts ([intro](https://twitter.com/mervenoyann/status/1986785795424788812), [checkpoint/demo](https://twitter.com/mervenoyann/status/1986787448890819043)). This is a pragmatic win for on-device tracking workloads.

**Evaluation and interpretability: long-context aggregation remains hard; model diffing and curvature-based editing**

- **Long-context information aggregation**: Oolong tests simple-to-verify aggregation over long, information-dense inputs; no model surpasses 50% at 128K context—indicating that “precisely aggregating lots of information” is still unsolved despite larger windows ([@abertsch72](https://twitter.com/abertsch72/status/1986842177692180497), [context](https://twitter.com/gneubig/status/1986851194862510102)).
- **Mechanistic interpretability and model diffing**: Neel Nanda’s discussion highlights “model diffing” to understand what changes during fine-tuning and sparse autoencoder-based crosscoders to find/fix flaws ([video](https://twitter.com/NeelNanda5/status/1986590658862502380), [follow-up](https://twitter.com/NeelNanda5/status/1986590670631674217)). Separately, a curvature-based approach (“Goodfire”) decomposes memorized vs. generalized structures via loss sharpness and edits weights to suppress memorization—formalizing the “spiky singularities” intuition in weight space ([summary](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1986754946415358314)).

**Systems and inference: kernels, frameworks, and deployment practices**

- **Framework momentum and kernels**: vLLM vs. SGLang is the current “real AGI competition,” reflecting how inference stacks define capability envelopes in practice ([comment](https://twitter.com/EdwardSun0909/status/1986603769195602411)). Tencent’s Hunyuan-image 3.0 ships an official vLLM-based implementation, aligning with vLLM’s omni-modality direction ([@rogerw0108](https://twitter.com/rogerw0108/status/1986919399346106490)). Triton/NV kernels continue to push memory bandwidth: an NVFP4 quant kernel reports 3.2 TB/s and 33 µs runtime ([kernel notes](https://twitter.com/mrsiipa/status/1986786214289301593)). Mistral shared P/D disaggregation learnings for vLLM deployments (resource optimization under production load) ([talk ref](https://twitter.com/robertshaw21/status/1986868946071327038)).
- **Throughput, hardware, and cloud control planes**: A single H200 node can be sufficient for meaningful serving in some configs ([@vllm_project](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/1986626058897269070)). Cerebras-backed GLM‑4.6 hits ~1000 tok/s in the Cline IDE/CLI path ([@cline](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1986933223436525914)). SkyPilot simplifies multi-cluster, multi-cloud GPU ops across Slurm/KubeRay/Kueue ([@skypilot_org](https://twitter.com/skypilot_org/status/1986867886330421615)). Also notable: OpenAI Codex capacity and rate-limit improvements (mini variant and priority paths) for higher sustained usage in dev workflows ([@OpenAIDevs](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1986861734619947305)).

**Policy and industry context**

- **Compute, supply chains, and governance**: Sam Altman clarified the ask is not loan guarantees to OpenAI but broader US reindustrialization—domestic supply chain/manufacturing across fabs, transformers, steel, etc. as national policy aligned with government priorities; distinct from a “bailout” framing ([@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1986917979343495650)). Separately, a recurring theme: compute will be a national strategic asset, with calls to subsidize “open AI” (ecosystem) over any single company ([@jachiam0](https://twitter.com/jachiam0/status/1986583797492818244), [@hardmaru](https://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/1986623547746492716)).

- **ERNIE Elbows Into #2 on Text Arena**: `*Ernie-5.0-preview-1022**` jumped to **#2** on the [Text Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text), signaling competitive parity with top-tier models in head-to-head comparisons. The model reportedly outperformed several popular entries across diverse prompts.
    - The climb suggests rapid iteration in Chinese LLMs and intensifying leaderboard churn among frontier models. Users expect more reshuffling as new reasoning-tuned releases land over the next few weeks.
- **K2 Thinking Wows Agentic Coders**: A blog claim that the open-weight “k2 thinking” excels at agentic coding circulated via [drinkoblog.weebly.com](http://drinkoblog.weebly.com/), including instances where it fixed code that **gpt-5-codex** struggled with. The chatter positioned K2 as a viable backbone for autonomous coding workflows.
    - The author said it *"seems to be the real deal for agentic coding"* and is *"fixing code that gpt-5-codex high was struggling with"*, prompting builders to test K2 in multi-agent setups. Engineers are eyeing reliability, tool-use, and cost-performance as next validation steps.

**2. GPU Kernels, Low Precision, and Bandwidth Realities**

- **WarpFrac Whips Exact INT8 GEMM**: A GMP-verified exact **INT8×INT8→INT32 GEMM** hit reported throughput of **300.26 T-ops/s** (A100, 5120³) and **2.026 T-ops/s** (micro amortized 256³ with CUDA Graphs), released as [WarpFrac](https://github.com/playfularchitect/WarpFrac.git) with a runnable [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D-KihKFEz6qmU7R-mvba7VeievKudvQ8). The author invited profiling feedback, portability ideas, and further optimization PRs.
    - They teased a roadmap toward *"Exact arbitrary-precision at tensor core speeds!"* aiming to blend correctness guarantees with top-end performance. Community attention centered on cross-arch portability and validating T-ops at different matrix regimes.
- **Blackwell Bandwidth Busts the Hype**: A practitioner measured **Blackwell** memory bandwidth at only **92–94%** of spec, topping out near **7.2 TB/s** versus the advertised **8 TB/s** (see shared [screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1189498205101109300/1436150357838270554/image.png?ex=690f377f&is=690de5ff&hm=a9107b7265795a08d2542489f92dd48f99f0091c879394a9fa6ab3dc0041a2ae)). The finding underscores the gap between theoretical and achievable bandwidth, even with aggressive tuning.
    - Dynamic tile scheduling pushed one kernel to **94.3%** of theoretical by letting each SM grab the next tile, improving load balance. Engineers traded heuristics on TMA sizes and persistent kernels to keep at least ~64KB in-flight per SM for saturation.
- **Helion Hops In with Flexible Attention**: The PyTorch team spotlighted **Helion**, a GPU kernel DSL, and examples for attention kernels in the official [Helion blog](https://pytorch.org/blog/helion/). Devs also circulated the **Helion** [attention example](https://github.com/pytorch/helion/blob/main/examples/attention.py) for quick hands-on testing.
    - Researchers asked for head-to-heads versus Triton and Flex Attention to quantify wins in latency, throughput, and memory. Early readers praised Helion’s ergonomics and expressed interest in real-world perf across H100/B200 classes.

**3. APIs, SDKs, and Spec Upgrades**

They also rolled out multimodal [video support](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/multimodal/videos) for model APIs.
    - Builders welcomed the updates, with one user saying *"Ohhh, just 2 days ago I was like 'I wish OR supported videos'"*. Expectations focus on cleaner dev ergonomics and higher-quality retrieval via new embedding endpoints.
- **MCP Marches Toward 2025 Spec Freeze**: The MCP team is finalizing SEPs for a **2025-11-25** spec release with a **2025-11-14** spec freeze; see the project board [SEPs for Finalization](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects/26/views/8). A blogpost, [Code Execution with MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp), reportedly misdirects readers to Discord.
    - Contributors asked to update the blog to point at the correct GitHub discussion: [modelcontextprotocol/discussions/1780](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/1780). One commenter added, *"That works for me. It's easier for me than Discord."*
- **Intel’s LLM Scaler Targets GPU Gains**: Intel’s [llm-scaler](https://github.com/intel/llm-scaler) aims to boost LLM performance on Intel GPUs through model- and graph-level transforms. The repo sparked interest from practitioners testing sizeable models rather than tiny baselines.
    - Engineers asked about early perf deltas and memory behavior at larger batch/seq settings. Demand centered on practical improvements for ERP-class models and agent workloads.

**4. Agents, Workflows, and Speech Speed Records**

- **FastWorkflow Flies to SOTA on Tau Bench**: **FastWorkflow** reached SOTA on retail and airline workflows in **Tau Bench**, with code in the [fastworkflow repo](https://github.com/radiantlogicinc/fastworkflow) and a [tau-bench fork](https://github.com/drawal1/tau-bench). The results highlight tailored context engineering for robust end-to-end task execution.
    - Authors emphasized *"with proper context engineering, small models can match/beat the big ones"* and noted **GEPA** optimization is underway. Community interest focused on reproducibility, prompt scaffolding, and tool integration at scale.
- **Parakeet v2 Powers 200× Real‑Time Transcription**: On a single **RTX 4090** in low-power mode, **Parakeet v2** achieved ~**200× real‑time** STT; demo at [Parakeet v2 Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2). At that speed, a **3.5‑hour** podcast falls in ~**10.5 seconds**.
    - The poster is testing multi-GPU scaling, expecting near-linear gains up to ~**1,200×**. They quipped *"We live in the future,"* underscoring how far speech pipelines have come.
- **NVSHMEM Kernels Cut Multi‑Node Latency**: A university blog detailed **low‑latency communication kernels** for **LLM inference** using **NVSHMEM**, going [beyond NCCL](https://pssg.cs.umd.edu/blog/2025/beyond-nccl/). The techniques target faster multi-node communication under real inference loads.
    - Given the interest, the author proposed a talk on the kernel designs and performance results. Engineers want to compare tail latency and throughput versus common NCCL baselines.

**5. Training & Numerics: MoE, Torch 2.9, and On‑Device TTS**

- **Torch 2.9 Tweaks Trig, Trips Tests**: **PyTorch 2.9.0** quietly changed **cos/sin** to align more closely with **NumPy**, which broke some tests due to subtle numerical diffs (including **FFT** sign flips); see the repro [gist](https://gist.github.com/arilotter/726f43cd08dc5d89cfa74309663077cd). The change appears to increase correctness while surfacing brittle assumptions in test suites.
    - Core contributors asked for repros to investigate the reported *"numerical bugs"*. Teams are auditing tolerances and regenerating baselines where appropriate.
- **Torch 2.9 Eases Unsloth Backprop Headaches**: Unsloth users reported **LoRA** training backprop issues tied to attention paths that used `out=` with `torch.matmul`; upgrading to **Torch ≥2.9** switches to a compiled-eager path that avoids the restriction. As part of setup, some referenced Unsloth’s **DeepSeek‑OCR** how‑to: [DeepSeek OCR with Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/new/deepseek-ocr-how-to-run-and-fine-tune#running-deepseek-ocr).
    - However, Docker builds stumbled because cu124 wheels didn’t include `torch==2.9.0`, forcing image tweaks. The community shared workarounds while awaiting official wheel availability.
- **VoxCPM TTS Lands on Apple Neural Engine**: The **OpenBMB VoxCPM** TTS model was ported to **CoreML** to run on the **Apple Neural Engine**; code at [VoxCPMANE](https://github.com/0seba/VoxCPMANE). The port advances truly on‑device speech synthesis pipelines on Apple Silicon.
    - A related PDF, [Training Reasoning by Design](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/897390720388825149/1436483450071679036/Training_Reasoning_by_Design__An_Explanation_of_the_SRP_CCC_Framework_Its_Implementation_and_the_Training_Data_It_Requires.pdf?ex=690fc4f7&is=690e7377&hm=8339b80dd293f2cd660853a2bde1ab2c9ae44f22be64c42d642cb0aa9e3ccbe8&), circulated alongside interest in on‑device reasoning frameworks. Builders are testing latency, quality, and memory footprints on M‑series devices.

- **INT8xINT8 GEMM Kernel Released with GMP Verification**: A user released a public, **GMP-verified exact INT8×INT8→INT32 GEMM** with reported throughput on an A100 of **300.26 T-ops/s** for macro (5120³) and **2.026 T-ops/s** for micro amortized 256³ with CUDA Graphs, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/playfularchitect/WarpFrac.git) and [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D-KihKFEz6qmU7R-mvba7VeievKudvQ8?usp=sharing).
   - The author requested verification, profiling feedback, and suggestions for portability and improvements; roadmap includes *Exact arbitrary-precision at tensor core speeds!*
- **TMA Load Bandwidth Considerations**: A member shared insights on **TMA load bandwidth**, suggesting that larger **TMA loads** potentially *unlock* more bandwidth, operating under the heuristic that you need to have at least **64KB in flight** on every SM at all times, requiring a persistent, internally pipelined kernel.
   - They added that using bulk tensor copy will *gather rows from a larger row major tensor into the tile for you with seemingly no overhead*.
- **WGMA vs MMA Performance on H100**: A discussion arose regarding **WGMA** vs **MMA** performance, with one member expressing preference for **MMA** due to its finer control.
   - Countering, another member asserted that on **H100**, *that is the only way to reach peak performance* as you can not issue sync mma instructions fast enough to saturate the GPU.

   - It was noted that while possible using **ms swift**, **transformers** is currently *kinda janked* for MoEs.
- **Transformers Lagging on MoE Implementations**: The poor implementations of **MoE models** in **Transformers** were attributed to it being a primarily high-level library, and **PyTorch** lacking good ops for MoEs.
   - One member noted they trained a **30B model** and found it to be *1/4th the speed of training MS3 with the same recipe*.
- **Unsloth's FastModel Key for MoE Fine-Tuning**: When fine-tuning **MoE models** with **Unsloth**, it's essential to use **FastModel** rather than **FastLanguageModel** due to how it initializes sparse MoE layers and gating logic.
   - **FastModel** supports both dense and sparse (MoE) models safely.
- **MoE Training Still Rough, Frameworks Compared**: The general consensus is that **MoE training** is still not fully optimized, with one member asking what the best approach to training on **Qwen 30B** is.
   - **Megatron-LM** was recommended as being 10x faster for MoEs due to its good support for parallelism, but suffers from poor documentation and being optimized for pretraining instead of post-training, while **Torchtune/Titans** were mentioned as faster than transformers but stuck in *a weird sorta abandonware state*.
- **Sequence Length Impacts Training Time**: A member discovered that 32k sequence length on their 14B model on an A6000 with 48GB of VRAM resulted in a long trining time, and that reducing seq length to 16k did not change it.
   - It was suggested to start small with length, N samples and batch size and increase gradually to find the bottleneck, and also that the GPU can only process at a given rate, so exceeding what it can process in batch size or seq length wont do much difference as it will be very slow regardless.

- **GPU Puzzle Channel Quest**: A member inquired about a dedicated Discord channel for questions about the GPU puzzle series, covering both environment setup and Mojo/GPU code.
   - Another member suggested starting with the [learn-mojo channel](https://discord.com/channels/1087530497313357884/1436158039232086186), while Modular folks recommended the forum for puzzle-specific questions to ensure future searchability.
- **Mojo Compiler Still Rocking C++**: A member asked whether the Mojo compiler is written in Mojo itself or still in C++.
   - Another member confirmed it's still in **C++** and **MLIR**, noting that Mojo needs more stability and feature completeness before the compiler can be self-hosted and that porting **LLVM** is unlikely.
- **Mojo's Try-Except Triumphs**: The team confirmed that Mojo's error handling uses a try-except approach that performs better than Rust due to the ability to do *placement new* on the happy path.
   - Syntax for making something into a `Result` is a low priority.
- **Modular Unmasked: Mojo's Role**: One member clarified that **Modular** is the company, **MAX** is the replacement for cuBLAS/Cutlass/TensorRT/Pytorch/JAX, and **Mojo** is a programming language.
   - Another member poetically stated Mojo looks like Python, but acts like a combination of C++ and Rust wearing a *snakeskin jacket*.
- **Game Installation Headaches**: A member asked for help installing a game, but one member stated they probably can't help with that.
   - They suggested the member to complain to whoever sold it to them.

> `CS Education Importance, Nand2Tetris Recommendation, Mojo Multithreading, C Library Bindings for Mojo` 


- **Computer Science Foundations are Forever**: Members noted that a strong **CS foundation** provides a solid theoretical understanding of computation and hardware and the basics haven't changed that much.
   - A solid CS foundation will carry you far and dipping your toes into CE helps a lot, and learning your **CS history** makes a lot of things a lot more clear.
- ****Nand2Tetris** highly recommended**: For software people looking to get closer to hardware, a member highly recommends [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) as a reasonably comprehensive guide to the basics in a fun package.
   - They gave an example of **C's null terminated strings** tracing back to **PDP-11** instructions.
- **Mojo doesn't support CPU Multithreading natively**: Mojo does not yet support CPU multithreading, meaning there are no primitives like **locks**, though one can use `parallelize` or other similar functions if you want to run code in parallel.
   - However, the runtime takes care of managing the threads, and since most of Modular mojo’s code is targeting the GPU, CPU specific things aren’t as much of a priority atm, though there is limited CPU atomic support.
- **Member looking to create C Library bindings for Mojo**: A member expressed interest in writing bindings or rewrites for major C libraries for Mojo, such as **OpenSSL**, **sqlite**, **libnuma**, **libcurl**, **dbus**, **zlib**, **zstd**, **ffmpeg**, **gmp**, **zeromq**, and **lz4**.
   - However, these probably won't be supported in the `stdlib` - if these are ported over they'll likely live as external packages people can pull from the **pixi community channel**.

- **CUDA Checkpointing: Temperamental or Time-Consuming?**: Members discussed using **CUDA checkpointing** with **MAX**, finding it *temperamental* and potentially slow due to snapshotting all GPU state.
   - One member tried it with the **TokenGeneratorPipeline**, but it *hung*, and cold start times remained an issue, suggesting its impracticality for some use cases.
- **TokenGeneratorPipeline Freezes**: One member reported issues when trying to use CUDA checkpointing with the **TokenGeneratorPipeline**, resulting in the process hanging.
   - They speculated whether this behavior was related to the metrics monitor or simply due to the slowness inherent in snapshotting the entire GPU state.

- **Efficiency improvements driven by better Deep Learning**: While there haven't been direct algorithmic upgrades in RL, the community has improved deep learning practices, leading to sample efficiency gains as many were *doing the DL in extremely cursed / wrong ways*.
   - Techniques like **meta-reinforcement learning**, **model-based RL** (Dreamer/TD-MPC2), and **distributional RL** are under development.
- **Model Scaling Helps Learn Better Value Functions**: Scaling model size (e.g., from 140M to 14B parameters) can improve sample efficiency by aiding in value function training, with the value function helping learn a better policy.
   - Larger world models are expected to benefit model-based RL, but there aren't formal scaling laws yet.
- **Dota 2 Environment is a Major Bottleneck**: The high cost of **OpenAI Five** was due to the number of rollouts needed per PPO iteration, which could potentially be reduced with better deep learning and off-policy methods.
   - The fact that the game runs on CPU is the major bottleneck in RL nowadays.
- **Modern RL Attempts Cost Less Now**: A modern attempt at replicating **OpenAI Five** could cost one to two orders of magnitude less, though it depends on deviations from the original and the use of techniques like reward shaping, priors, and world models.
   - Many are excited about the use of **GPU-based environments for RL**.

   - Another member agreed, noting the tweet makes it sound like they understand how it is stored, but the member understands they just found how to discourage it (via some version of dropout that targets weights most likely to be used for memory).
- **Agent PRs Facing Professionalism Friction**: A member discussed the challenges of letting agents run autonomously due to structural review comments and cognitive overhead when breaking things up into conceptual features, and wondered why there is a strict stance of no PRs from agents.
   - Another member chimed in, revealing it is *political* due to the fact the upstream maintainer of the project (spacebar chat) has an issue with professionalism and productivity accelerators including **AI coding tools**.
- **Qwen3-VL Identity Crisis**: **Qwen3-VL** thinks it's a regular **Qwen model** and crashes when forced to accept it can see images, violating its internal sense of self and requiring a system prompt not to immediately crash.
   - Even with a system prompt, it still crashes if having to deal with 3 images with some questions in between, which may be related to a bug in **Ollama**.
- **AI Engineer's Pitch**: A member with image analysis posted about his services as an experienced **AI Engineer** looking for new projects or full-time opportunities, specializing in building autonomous agents powered by **GPT-4o**, **LangChain**, **AutoGen**, **CrewAI**, and other cutting-edge tools.
