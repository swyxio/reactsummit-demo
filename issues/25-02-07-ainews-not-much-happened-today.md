> `GRPO Performance, Model Quantization, Conciseness in Reasoning, Using LLMs for Reward Functions, Benchmarking Models` 


- **GRPO Training Slowdown**: The GRPO implementation on Qwen 2.5 1.5B is notably slow, taking around 40 minutes for just 100 training steps, prompting discussions on speeding up processes.
   - Some contributors mentioned adjusting settings for VLLM could yield slight improvements in speed but acknowledged inherent slowness in GRPO.
- **Exploring Quantization Techniques**: Quantization settings, such as using --leave-output-tensors, are being explored to improve the quality of models like Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B during the quantization process.
   - Keeping Output Tensors in unquantized state has reportedly led to improved coherence, making the calibration and quantization efforts essential for model performance.
- **Efforts to Enhance Reasoning Conciseness**: Discussions highlighted attempts to create a model that produces more concise reasoning outputs by potentially compressing longer reasoning chains.
   - The idea of using another model to rate and filter out less useful reasoning paths was proposed as a strategy for refining the output.
- **LLMs as Judges for Reward Functions**: Using LLMs to evaluate the quality of reasoning steps in training was discussed as a method for refining reward functions during model training.
   - This involves creating a scoring system for CoT output, where an LLM rates individual thoughts, contributing to overall learning goals.
- **Need for Benchmarking Models**: A call for better benchmarking methodologies emerged, emphasizing the importance of evaluating models like DeepSeek V3 against various metrics to assess effectiveness.
   - Acknowledgments were made over the need for comprehensive benchmarks that can capture the performance and efficiency of large language models.

> `Image Classifiers and Concept Erasure, Skip Transcoders vs Sparse Autoencoders, Quadratic Feature Removal Methods` 


- **Image Classifiers learn faster when erasing features**: Research shows that erasing simple features from training data can sometimes accelerate learning in image classifiers, rather than hinder it. The method, LELeast-Squares Concept Erasure (LEACE), consistently complicates learning for various classifier architectures.
   - In contrast, quadratic erasure methods exhibited mixed results, prompting a recommendation for caution when applying these techniques in practice.
- **Skip Transcoders outperform Sparse Autoencoders**: Introduction of **skip transcoders** demonstrates improvements in interpretability and model fidelity over Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). By utilizing a sparse bottleneck and a linear skip connection, they enhance expressivity without compromising interpretability.
   - In related work, despite efforts using skip transcoders to rewrite parts of transformers, outcomes fell short of expectations, establishing a need for ongoing enhancements.
- **Complexities in Quadratic Feature Removal**: The study discusses two methods for removing quadratic features, QLEACE and ALF-QLEACE, which yield different effects on model performance. Notably, QLEACE's dependence on true class labels resulted in unintended consequences when applied.
