  **METR** published a paper measuring AI agent autonomy progress, showing it
  has doubled every 7 months since **2019 (GPT-2)**. They introduced a new
  metric, the **50%-task-completion time horizon**, where models like **Claude
  3.7 Sonnet** achieve 50% success in about 50 minutes. Projections estimate **1
  day autonomy by 2028** and **1 month autonomy by late 2029**. Meanwhile,
  **Nvidia** released **Cosmos-Transfer1** for conditional world generation and
  **GR00T-N1-2B**, an open foundation model for humanoid robot reasoning with 2B
  parameters. **Canopy Labs** introduced **Orpheus 3B**, a high-quality
  text-to-speech model with zero-shot voice cloning and low latency. **Meta**
  reportedly delayed **Llama-4** release due to performance issues.

[Llama 4 rumors](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jes8ue/llama4_is_probably_coming_next_month_multi_modal/
) and [$600 o1 pro API](https://x.com/openaidevs/status/1902485690958450871?s=46) aside, we rarely get to feature a paper as a title story on AINews, so we are really happy when it happens. [METR](https://x.com/METR_Evals/status/1902384481111322929) has long been known for doing quality analysis around AI progress, and in [Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14499) they have an answer to a valuable question that has so far been extremely difficult to answer: **agent autonomy is increasing, but how quickly?**

**Since 2019 (GPT2), it has doubled every 7 months.**

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f700d580-e607-4b22-b5cf-b68daf96b148.png?w=960&fit=max)

Obviously agents can take a range of time to complete tasks, which has made this question difficult to answer, therefore the methodology is worthwhile as well:

> "To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in terms
of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: **50%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI models can
complete with 50% success rate.** We first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter tasks. **On
these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50% time
horizon of around 50 minutes."**

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/88dc7803-50d0-4dab-9f9a-775b229aeb0e.png?w=960&fit=max)

The authors find a notable discontinuity at the 1min horizon:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ff524a95-489c-42f8-b0de-43bfb9d4319d.png?w=960&fit=max)

and at the 80% cutoff, but the scaling laws remain robust.

At current rates, we will have:

- **1 day autonomy** in (5 exponentials * 7 months) = 3 years (2028)
- **1 month autonomy** in "late 2029" (+/- 2 years, only going for human working hours)

> `Vision finetuning issues with Gemma 3, Unsloth and vLLM event in SF, Evaluate model performance with Wandb, Fine-tuning base vs instruct models, Unsloth with multinode and multigpu finetuning` 


- **Gemma 3 Vision Finetuning runs into Transformers Glitch**: Users reported issues finetuning **Gemma 3** for vision tasks, indicating a potential problem with vision support in the current **Transformers** version.
   - One user encountered a *RuntimeError: Unsloth: Failed to make input require gradients!* when trying to qlora `gemma-3-12b-pt-bnb-4bit` for image captioning, suggesting a need for further investigation.
- **Unsloth and vLLM Team Up for SF Event**: Unsloth will be joining vLLM and Ollama for an event in SF next week on Thursday, March 27th, promising social time and presentations. The event is hosted at Y Combinator's San Francisco office.
   - More details are available for the [vLLM & Ollama inference night](https://lu.ma/vllm-ollama) where food and drinks will be served.
- **Wandb Integration and Model Evaluation Explored**: Members discussed how to evaluate model performance before and after fine-tuning using **Wandb** within **Unsloth**, with a focus on tracking training loss.
   - It's generally accepted the training loss going down during training is a sign that it's working*, but it's also essential to test the model and potentially run benchmarks.
- **Base vs Instruct Model Debate Intensifies**: The discussion revolved around whether fine-tuning a base or instruct model with a dataset of 30k samples results in a strictly better model, generating diverse opinions and considerations.
   - One member emphasized that *fine tuning can worsen the model's performance if your data is bad or poorly formatted*, which could also cause the model to *forget* things outside of the dataset.
- **Multi-Node Multi-GPU Support teased for Unsloth**: Multi-node and multi-GPU fine-tuning support is planned for Unsloth in the coming weeks, as announced by a team member, although the specific release date has not yet been specified.
   - The Unsloth team recommends to [sign up for the newsletter](https://unsloth.ai/newsletter) to receive updates on the release, but one member confirmed multinode support will be enterprise only.

> `AMD Support for BnB and Triton, Gemma Base Model Changes, Training GPTs Agent, OpenAI's sidebars, Multi-turn conversation datasets + LLM fine-tuning` 


- **AMD & Unsloth: A Promising Partnership**: Members reported that **BnB and Triton** are now supported in **AMD**, and with some modifications to Unsloth, it could potentially work on AMD GPUs.
   - While a bounty could be offered, there's hesitancy to make it a top priority, given the lack of testing and unknowns with **AMD**.
- **Gemma's Gotcha: Chat Template Conundrums**: A member noted unusual behavior when applying a LoRA to a base **Gemma** model pulled from HF Unsloth, suspecting a chat template issue.
   - Theyruinedelise clarified that **no changes were made recently to the Gemma base model**, and suggested checking the chat template.
- **SageMaker Setup Snafus: Dependency Doldrums**: A user encountered a **RuntimeError** when running the **Phi_4-Conversational** notebook on Amazon SageMaker due to import issues related to torchvision.
   - TheDragondagger solved it by following a reference notebook and **uninstalling/installing libraries** as done in the ref notebook, suggesting to pay attention to dependencies when using Unsloth & SageMaker.
- **Memory Mirage: Chasing VRAM Savings on 4090**: Despite a blog post suggesting it fits in 20GB of VRAM, a user ran into **out-of-memory errors** while fine-tuning `unsloth/QwQ-32B-unsloth-bnb-4bit` on a 4090.
   - Theyruinedelise suggested reducing `max_seq_length` and batchsize, while clarifying that **20GB is the minimum, as the GPU reserves some VRAM** and recommended a minimum of 22GB.
- **Docs get dunked, saving throws for those filesystem woes**: A user experienced a `HFValidationError` and `FileNotFoundError` when trying to save a merged model locally, due to an invalid repository ID when calling `save_pretrained_merged`.
   - The recommendation was to update `unsloth-zoo` as [it should be fixed](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth-zoo/blob/main/unsloth_zoo/saving_utils.py#L544-L549) in the latest version.

> `NVIDIA Digit Pricing, 5090 bandwidth vs M4 Max, NPU vs iGPU for small models, Multi GPU Performance Issues, NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell` 


- **NVIDIA DIGITS Priced Less Than Mac Mini M4 Pro**: Members discussed the pricing of NVIDIA's DIGITS, finding it comparable to a **Mac Mini M4 Pro** with similar specs but half the RAM, despite DIGITS featuring a Blackwell GPU and 273 GB/s bandwidth.
   - Concerns were raised about DIGITS' value, especially with its limited bandwidth, with some suggesting it's a *worse* value than an M4 machine or Ryzen 395+.
- **5090 Bandwidth Bottleneck?**: A user observed that an **RTX 5090** running Gemma 3 27B q4 achieves ~40 tok/s, while an **M4 Max** reaches ~20 tok/sec, which is unexpected given the 5090's superior compute and memory bandwidth.
   - Others noted that the 5090 doesn't reach max power during inference and that switching to the **Vulkan runtime** improves performance, hinting at a CPU or software-level bottleneck rather than a hardware limitation, others shared this [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/8_pw7mKmaLw?t=700) showing similar results.
- **NPU Lacks Support**: Members confirmed that there is currently no support for **NPUs** at the llama.cpp level, so a **iGPU** would outperform a 40 TOPS NPU.
   - There was also a suggestion that if a GPU provides 800 tops and npu 50 than it does not matter anyway .
- **Multi-GPU Setups May Degrade Performance**: A user reported performance degradation and instability when using multiple **RTX 3060s** (3 on PCI-e x1 and 1 on x16) in LM Studio with CUDA llama.cpp, as single GPU performance (x16) was superior.
   - It was suggested that the performance issues were because of how models are split between multiple GPUs and that Pci-e 3.0 x4 slows inference down up to 10%.
- **NVIDIA Unveils RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell**: NVIDIA launched its [RTX PRO 6000 "Blackwell" GPUs](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-rtx-pro-workstations-servers-agentic-ai) which features a GB202 GPU, 24K cores, 96 GB VRAM and requires 600W TDP.
   - The performance of this card is believed to be much better than the 5090 due to the fact it has HBM.

> `Stochastic Variational Inference, Inference Algorithm, Reparameterization` 


- **Stochastic Variational Inference Algorithm Introduced**: A paper on how to perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models introduces a **stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm** that scales to large datasets.
   - The paper, entitled *Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes* is available as a [PDF here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114).
- **Reparameterization Yields Lower Bound Estimator**: The paper shows that a **reparameterization of the variational lower bound** yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods.
   - It also states that posterior inference can be made efficient by fitting an approximate inference model to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

> `Gemini vs ChatGPT, o1 and o3-mini-high model comparison, GPT-4.5 creative writing, DeepSeek Banned` 


- **Gemini and ChatGPT Go Head-to-Head**: Members debated whether [Gemini Advanced](https://gemini.google.com/) or [ChatGPT Plus](https://chat.openai.com/) is better, with one user arguing **Gemini's** free **2.0 Flash Thinking** is superior to many of **ChatGPT's** models, citing its *unlimited* access compared to **ChatGPT's** limits.
   - However, another stated that **Gemini** *doesn't even have the basics*, referring to its safety alignment, content flagging, and overall implementation.
- **o1 and o3-mini-high still reign supreme**: Despite discussion around **Gemini** and other models, some members believe that the **OpenAI's o1** and **o3-mini-high models** are still the best for tasks requiring reasoning, such as **STEM** tasks like coding, planning, and math, noting that nothing comes close in their experience.
   - They add that **Google** is the worst of all models, especially in those areas, and that **Grok 3** and **Claude 3.7 Thinking** are the only models that may be close in quality.
- **GPT-4.5 Creative Writing Disappoints**: One member found **GPT-4.5's** creative writing capabilities disappointing, describing the model's performance as inconsistent, sometimes ignoring context, making logic errors, and repeating phrases, sounding at times like **GPT-4 Turbo**.
   - They added that the results were surprisingly better on the second run, but the extreme message limit is ridiculous.
- **DeepSeek Gets the Boot From University**: One member reported that their university banned the use of **DeepSeek**, with another user confirming that this ban only applied to **DeepSeek** and not other **LLMs**.
   - One reason for the ban might have been because the actual model itself has no actual guidelines or filters because it drastically degrades performance since it has to tiptoe around the *illegal* topics

   - Using **max_tokens** ensures compatibility across all models, while using the OpenAI-specific parameter might not.
- **ChatGPT-4o slower due to cost optimization**: **ChatGPT-4o** via the API is faster than the **ChatGPT** interface because OpenAI prioritizes cost savings on the latter.
   - Perplexity's first token is very fast, but ChatGPT is slow and inconsistent.
- **Prompt caching causing trouble?**: A user experienced issues with **prompt caching**, paying 1.25x the price without proper cache hits, even after setting up provider routing and *allow_fallbacks* to false.
   - After lots of debugging, the user resolved the issue without pinpointing the exact cause but thinks it might have to do with the order of adding the system prompt messages, but now it works.

> `Multi-turn Fine Tuning, SFT Codebase Masking` 


- **Multi-turn Fine Tuning Tactics**: A member asked about the standard procedure in multi-turn fine-tuning, specifically if it involves unrolling into many data points from a multi-turn prompt and masking the context every time.
   - Another member responded that their codebase for SFT involves just masking the first prompt and then next tokenizing everything.
- **SFT Codebase Masking Implementation**: The discussion highlighted that the current codebase for SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) employs a method of masking only the initial prompt in a multi-turn sequence.
   - Subsequent tokens in the sequence are then processed without masking, which contrasts with some standard multi-turn fine-tuning practices.

- **Semianalysis Migrates from Substack to WordPress**: **Semianalysis** has switched from **Substack** to a **WordPress** site, primarily to utilize **Passport** for a more complex website.
   - While the move saves on fees, the savings are now spent on development, as suggested by one member: *make more on models than blog*.
- **AI2's Mysterious Monetary Model**: The question arose regarding how **AI2 (Allen Institute for AI)** makes money, with the initial assumption being through donations.
   - Another member mentioned, *It’s in the name…*, referencing **Paul Allen**, the founder, calling him one of the *better billionaires*.

> `OpenAI triple threat, AI addiction and its implications, Practical AI Development exercises, Smart Glasses and Data Harvesting, Simulated vs. Real World Data for AI Training` 


- **OpenAI Excels Across Model, Application, and Pricing**: Despite some reservations, a member acknowledged **OpenAI**'s comprehensive strength in **model development**, **product application**, and **pricing strategies**, positioning them uniquely in the AI landscape.
   - This all-encompassing approach contrasts with other companies that may specialize in only one or two of these critical areas.
- **AI Companionship Sparks Addictive Sentiments**: Concerns arise as AI agents, particularly **vocal assistants**, foster addictive tendencies, leading some users to develop emotional attachments.
   - This trend raises ethical considerations about intentionally designed addictive features and their potential impact on users' dependency, prompting discussions on whether companies should avoid features that might enhance such addictive behaviors.
- **Smart Glasses: Data Harvesting Disguised as Urban Chic?**: A discussion ensued around **Meta** and **Amazon**'s aggressive push for smart glasses, suggesting potential for data harvesting, especially egocentric views, curated for robotics companies.
   - A member joked about a smart glasses startup idea for villains, highlighting features such as emotion detection, dream-state movies, and shared perspectives, creating a dependence feedback-loop to collect user data and train models.
- **Simulated vs. Real: Grounding the World of AI**: The discussion explored whether AI can achieve AGI through pure simulation or if real-world data is crucial, with one member highlighting **Tesla**'s success due to learning from the world, contrasting **Waymo**'s reliance on expensive devices.
   - Participants also debated the value of Minecraft as a training ground for agentic behavior, emphasizing its rule-based environment and advanced mechanics as a proxy for real-world problem-solving.
- **GAN Training: Beta Parameter's Bizarre Behavior**: Members discussed why the **DCGAN** paper advocated adjusting the momentum term β1, and whether gradient clipping would be a better approach.
   - One member explained that a high β1 is undesirable because the discriminator changes around the current iterate, thus future work like [Karras et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10196) went as far as completely disabling the momentum of Adam (β₁=0) and only keeping the curvature information.

- **Auxiliary Model Emerges as Phi-4 Shines**: Members discussed that **Phi-4** could be useful as an *auxiliary model* in a complex system, highlighting its ability to follow directions, interface with other LLMs, and handle roleplay, noting that *it would be useful as an auxilliary model in a complex system where you already had a bunch of other models*.
- **Decoding Claude's Loose Language Interpretation**: A user criticized **Claude's AI** suggestions, pointing out inaccuracies in its model size recommendations, as the list of models it gave in response were not under *10m parameters* as requested, see [the Claude output](https://claude.ai/share/03dcf20f-800a-4cdc-b961-30f4009555af).
   - A member responded by saying *That's tricky because often natural language isn't super literal, and "10m" could be taken as a shorthand for "very light models that are generally accessible on modern hardware", which to be fair, is a theme consistent throughout Claude's response.*
- **"Vibe Coding" Validated as Background Learning**: A member shared a personal anecdote about learning Japanese through immersion and consumption of media, drawing a parallel to the value of "vibe coding" for background learning and skill acquisition.
   - They say that *Even vibe coding, you still have to worry about things like interfaces between modules so that you can keep scaling with limited LLM context windows.*

> `matmul output fusions, nvfuser stalls, Tensor Cores vs CUDA Cores, cooperative or ping-pong warp specialization, fusing activation in GEMM` 


- **Nvfuser's Matmul Output Fusions Face Hurdles**: A member noted that implementing [matmul output fusions for **nvfuser**](https://github.com/rdspring1) is difficult, and even with multiplication/addition, it introduces stalls, making it slower than separate kernels due to the need to keep tensor cores fed.
   - He was surprised that optimizing these things is pretty nontrivial.
- **Concurrent TC and CUDA Core execution?**: A member inquired whether the difficulty arises because **Tensor Cores** and **CUDA Cores** cannot run concurrently, potentially fighting for register usage.
   - They recalled seeing Blackwell docs stating **TC** and **CUDA cores** can now run concurrently.
- **Autotuning Fusion Strategies**: A member expressed curiosity about autotuning fused operations, questioning which strategies can hide the operations being fused, especially considering there are options and one will be the best.
   - Another member pointed out that on **Hopper**, there are basically two options: cooperative or ping-pong warp specialization.
- **Performance Impact of Fusing Activation in GEMM**: In **gpu-mode lecture 45**, it was discussed that fusing activation in GEMM can sometimes hurt performance if **GEMM** uses all registers, making it faster to split **GEMM** and activation into two kernels.
   - A member has experienced similar results when writing custom fuseg **GEMM+activation triton kernels**.

- **CompactDict advantages spark interest**: Members discussed the advantages of **CompactDict**, with one user still suffering from the **SIMD-Struct-not-supported issue** in the built-in dict and being quite happy about an alternative solution.
   - A report about a year ago was published [on GitHub](https://github.com/mzaks/compact-dict) detailing two specialized Dict implementations, one for **Strings** and another forcing the implementation of the trait **Keyable**.
- **HashMap in stdlib gains traction**: There was a suggestion to include the *generic_dict* in the **standard library** as **HashMap**, letting the current **Dict** be as it is.
   - Concerns were raised about **Dict** needing to do a lot of very not-static-typed things, making it potentially more valuable to add a new struct with a better design and deprecate **Dict** over time.
- **List.fill behavior surprises users**: It was questioned whether filling uninitialized parts of the **lists buffer** should be optional, as calling **List.fill** could surprisingly change the length of the list.
   - The suggestion was made to make filling uninitialized parts of the lists buffer optional, as calling `List.fill` could surprisingly change the **length** of the list.
- **StringDict module considered viable**: It was suggested that the standard library should adopt some of the features of **CompactDict**, like a better hash function and simpler probing strategy, but all the compaction features go beyond the scope of a standard lib **Dictionary**.
   - The author still believes it is viable to have compact **StringDict**, but it can be included as a separate module.
- **List index out of range goes unnoticed**: A user noticed that there is no index out of range check in **List**, expressing surprise since they thought that was what **unsafe_get** was for.
   - Another member has run into this issue also, with someone from Modular saying it needs to be added *at some point*.

> `Latent Activations, Model Behavior, Sequence Processing` 


- **Latent Activations Represent Full Sequences**: To understand a model's normal behavior, one should generate **latent activations** from *entire sequences*, rather than individual tokens.
   - The poster suggests that focusing on *entire sequences* provides a more accurate representation of what the **model** does normally.
- **Generating Latents with get_activations(sequence)**: The poster provides code examples, recommending `latents = get_activations(sequence)` as the *correct* method.
   - They warn against using `latents = cat([get_activation(tok) for tok in sequence))`*, as it produces **latents** that aren't 'interesting'.

- **Confused Index Selection for REDUCE_LOAD**: A member requested clarification on the meaning of `x.src[2].src[1].src[1]` and the reasons for selecting these indices as `reduce_input` for the **REDUCE_LOAD pattern**.
   - The code snippet checks if `x.src[2].src[1].src[1]` is not equal to `x.src[2].src[0]`, and accordingly assigns either `x.src[2].src[1].src[1]` or `x.src[2].src[1].src[0]` to `reduce_input`.
