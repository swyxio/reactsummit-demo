**AI and Geopolitics/Economics**

- **Trump's Tariffs**:  [@AravSrinivas](https://twitter.com/AravSrinivas/status/1907544372209656008) summarized tariffs news using **AskPerplexity**, highlighting the economic implications. [@wightmanr](https://twitter.com/wightmanr/status/1907584236586168726) criticized the rates as fake and nonsensical and notes that considering the VAT a tariff is moronic given that it applies to foreign and domestic goods equally, and asks where the adults in the room are. [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1907672235571089916) found it interesting that **Xi** isn't a great enjoyer of tariffs, [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1907733709328883899) also laid out a 200 IQ thesis of how a chain reaction of reciprocal tariffs could crash **Choyna**.
- **AI Scalability and Compute**: [@MillionInt](https://twitter.com/MillionInt/status/1907547857001025844) states that even for today's lame LLM models, demand already outpaces GPU supply, while [@AravSrinivas](https://twitter.com/AravSrinivas/status/1907808439440736695) emphasizes that AI is still massively compute-bound, presenting a golden opportunity.
- **China and the US**: [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1907644924066988526) argues that Americans who say “well WE'RE THE BIGGEST CONSUMER what will you losers do lmao?” seem to be honestly deluded about their place in the world and will be made smaller, while [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1907703600035373523) states if **China** tariffed **Western** capital inputs during its industrial acceleration, **China** today would still be making **Nike** shoes by hand.
- [@fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1907590987779813633) says that one of the major weaknesses of autocracy is that the autocrat, being surrounded by sycophants that are terrified of him and that were selected for loyalty or blood ties rather than competence, becomes completely insulated from actual reality and faces no pushback on bad decisions

**Humor/Memes**

- **Congratulations**: [@pabbeel](https://twitter.com/pabbeel/status/1907559659957067868) simply tweeted "congratulations!!!"
- **Public list meme**: [@nearcyan](https://twitter.com/nearcyan/status/1907683935129354412) mentioned that the public list meme is really funny.
- **Grok thinks there might be a mistake in the simulation**: [@vikhyatk](https://twitter.com/vikhyatk/status/1907731769388052576) posted, "grok thinks there might be a mistake in the simulation".

> `Brazilian Lawyer using AI, ReferrerNation's BPO job matchmaking platform, Learning code with AI assistance, Claude for report writing, AI competition from China` 


- ****Brazilian Lawyer enters AI Realm****: A Brazilian lawyer is starting to use **AI tools** in their legal practice, despite being a self-described "boomer" (39 years old) and new to Discord.
   - The lawyer, who began coding in Delphi in 2002, expressed concerns about the advances in AI and is now exploring Manus to stay relevant in their field.
- ****ReferrerNation Enters the Arena****: Mark, CEO of [ReferrerNation.com](https://www.referrernation.com/) *a global BPO job-matching platform*, aims to integrate **AI** to improve recruitment and automation, while soon integrating **crypto-based incentives**.
   - After some community members expressed that his initial posts seemed too spammy and overtly crypto-focused, Mark apologized and noted, *I’ll take the time to understand the vibe here better before posting more.*
- ****Learn to Code with Gemini and Claude****: Members recommended using **Gemini 2.5** or **Claude** for learning to code, as they are excellent **AI coding models** that can assist with understanding and project work.
   - A police chief reportedly uses **Claude** to write standardized reports during night shifts.
- ****Manus Credit Crunch Sparks Tips and Tricks****: Many users reported **rapid credit depletion**, with free credits vanishing quickly, leading to discussions on optimizing prompts and efficient usage.
   - Members advised newcomers to read the <#1355477259234054323> tips section to avoid wasting credits, noting that the team is working on reducing credit usage rates. Members shared that using other tools in conjunction with manus, for example [R1](https://www.perplexity.ai/) is very effective for efficient credit spend.
- ****Leverage External Code to Save the Day****: A member mentioned difficulty downloading files from Manus due to lack of credits and so community suggested using third party apps such as Claude to extract code and files.
   - It was also mentioned that the best practice is to download all files from Manus, give it to something else. then, ask that other AI, for example Gemini *provide me files for this website* then I go to Manus and say *add these files to this website*.

> `Meta vision model Cotton, Qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct OCR, Google Gemini Models, Nightwhisper model on webdev, Gemini 2.6 Pro experimental` 


- **Qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct gives Google Gemini models a run for their money in OCR**: For OCR of low-quality text in Japanese, `qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct` is almost on par with **Google Gemini models**.
   - However, the Meta vision model, `cotton`, felt more like the other recent **text-only anonymous models from Meta**.
- **Nightwhisper debuts on WebDev**: The **Nightwhisper** model is available only on [webdev arena](https://webdev.lmarena.ai/) which may be a coding model only.
   - Members suspect that **Nightwhisper = Gemini 2.6 Pro experimental** and does not appear in normal arena.
- **Nightwhisper excels at webpage generation, struggles with existing code**: **Nightwhisper** is proving exceptional at crafting functional apps with appealing UIs, and can work with a temporary URL to generate projects on the [webdev arena](https://webdev.lmarena.ai/)).
   - However, some users have reported that Nightwhisper exhibits difficulties when editing existing code or adhering to specific formatting requests, leading to frustration.
- **WebDev arena introduces model cloning**: WebDev arena has issues with rendering, but one user discovered a method of model cloning, in which the model gives the same screen twice.
   - After receiving an error message from NightWhisper and a repeated error after giving the code again, its name is not shown, indicating model cloning.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro vs Nightwhisper - the battle continues**: **Gemini 2.5 Pro** achieved a **24.4%** on the [USAMO 2025](https://matharena.ai/), but some models tend to stop mid-sentence or give partial responses.
   - One user found Gemini better at creating a Pokemon simulator, while Nightwhisper produced a cleaner UI but with weird attack power values that were too high.

> `Restoring to previous checkpoints, Roo code, Boomerang Mode, Gemini Pro EXP vs Pro MAX, Windsurf vs Cursor tab` 


- **Branch Bugs Baffle Backtracking**: Members reported having issues with **restoring to previous checkpoints** in Cursor, encountering bugs from later states even in supposedly clean branches and members suggested doing a `git diff branch1,branch2` to identify the differences.
   - One member experienced a CSS overhaul from a simple logo change prompt, highlighting the potential for unexpected modifications.
- **Roo Code workflow is catching fire**: One user described their sweet workflow on **Roo Code**, highlighting its cost-effectiveness at around **$0.4 per day**, achieved through selective model usage.
   - They also mentioned its superior capabilities compared to Cursor for specific tasks, as well as [the associated docs](https://docs.roocode.com/features/boomerang-tasks/).
- **Boomerang Mode Gains Traction**: Members discussed the benefits of **Boomerang Mode** in Roo Code, where tasks are divided into subtasks handled by separate agents, enabling more efficient problem-solving than relying on Gemini 2.5 for everything.
   - Boomerang mode is very customisable and one user shares *I will weld it down, don't worry*.
- **Peeking at PearAI Pricing**: Users compared the pricing models of Cursor and **PearAI**, with PearAI offering some free credits to test Roo Code.
   - However, it was clarified that PearAI's **$15/month plan** includes a credit limit, after which usage-based charges apply, contrasting with claims of unlimited model access and one member even accused Cursor of "*scamming people!*"
- **Nightly Builds Nurture New Navigational Notions**: Cursor **0.49.1** is available as a nightly build with this flag set on your account `account settings, advanced -> developer settings`.
   - The feature is supposedly a context window indicator for agent use, as well as a Windsurf API key.

- **Unsloth Auto Batch Size**: Users discussed Unsloth automatically setting batch size to 2 when using multiple GPUs, and a solution was found by setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`.
   - One user pointed out that Unsloth uses `per_device_train_batch_size` and linked to the [relevant code in `training_utils.py`](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth-zoo/blob/4a66f8b08952fc148f5c74cd15aec52cb0113e2d/unsloth_zoo/training_utils.py#L206).
- **Troubleshooting with SFTTrainer**: A user encountered a `ValueError` when using the normal `Trainer` with Llama 3.2 1B instruct, even with FP16 turned off, but it was resolved by switching to `SFTTrainer`.
   - It was hypothesized that the model might be bfloat16 and Unsloth couldn't get the dtype from `Trainer`, suggesting checking the model config json.
- **Gemma3 Vision with Unsloth**: A user successfully started Gemma3 finetuning with vision samples using Unsloth, noting an issue with `UnslothVisionDataCollator` only accepting samples with an image.
   - They were curious if a custom collator could be used with Gemma3/Unsloth, rather than `UnslothVisionDataCollator`, and asked about potential gotchas or examples.
- **Qwen2.5 Image Size Woes**: Users discussed how to set the image size explicitly before feeding it into Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and it was found that resizing the images manually can lead to errors, as the model resizes internally.
   - One user confirmed that resizing images to **364x364** works, while another suggested trying **224x224**.
- **GRPO Training Bottleneck on CPU**: A user observed a CPU bottleneck (one core at 100% usage) while running the Gemma3_(1B)-GRPO.ipynb code, limiting training speed despite low GPU utilization (25%).
   - Suggestions included profiling the code to identify CPU-intensive operations and considering that the process might be memory bound rather than compute bound due to the small model size.

- **Github Copilot now features plug-n-play OpenRouter Keys**: Users can now add an [OpenRouter key](https://openrouter.ai/) and select any model they want in Github Copilot.
   - This integration gives Github Copilot users access to a wider range of models beyond those offered by OpenAI.
- **Google to Rent Nvidia Blackwell from CoreWeave**: Google is in advanced talks to rent **Nvidia Blackwell** chips from CoreWeave, and potentially house its **TPUs** in CoreWeave facilities, highlighting intense customer demand for compute ([The Information Article](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-advanced-talks-rent-nvidia-ai-servers-coreweave)).
   - The move suggests Google might be **TPU poor**, especially with the realization that inference demand will be high.
- **OpenAI Stealth Launches Quasar Alpha on OpenRouter**: A new "stealth model" named **Quasar Alpha** launched on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/openrouter/quasar-alpha) with **1,000,000 context** and free input/output tokens, described as a powerful, all-purpose model supporting long-context tasks and code generation.
   - Community members have speculated it could be an **open source SSM** given its speed, or even secretly from **OpenAI** despite their lack of formal announcement, and despite the model's tendency to output short responses and listicles.
- **Anthropic's CoT Research Casts Doubt on Monitoring**: New [Anthropic research](https://www.anthropic.com/research/reasoning-models-dont-say-think) reveals that reasoning models don't accurately verbalize their reasoning, questioning whether monitoring **chains-of-thought (CoT)** is sufficient for catching safety issues.
   - They slipped problem-solving hints to **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** and **DeepSeek R1**, then tested whether their Chains-of-Thought would mention using the hint to come to that conclusion. Read the [related blog post here](https://www.anthropic.com/research/reasoning-models-dont-say-think).
- **DeepSeek V3 Fails Frontier Model Test**: New [SEAL leaderboards](http://scale.com/leaderboard) indicate that **DeepSeek V3** is not a frontier-level model, ranking 8th on Humanity’s Last Exam (text-only) and 12th on MultiChallenge (multi-turn).
   - Despite not being 'frontier', some users find it to be a **banger** better than **Claude 3.7** for writing ptx kernels for b200s.

- ****Cognition Labs** releases **Devin 2.0****: **Cognition Labs** introduced [Devin 2.0](https://fxtwitter.com/cognition_labs/status/1907836719061451067), a new agent-native IDE experience, generally available starting at **$20** plus pay as you go.
   - Some members found this launch *too funny* because the competition might find PMF before **Devin** does.
- ****Windsurf** hailed as better Agent than **Cursor****: Some members find that **Windsurf** has *nailed the Agent stuff better* than **Cursor**, whereas **Cursor** reduces friction for getting the LLM to do boring but time consuming things.
   - Others agreed, but said that the question is basically whether it is meaningfully better than having a separate window open, and the answer is, *uh, barely*.
- ****Claude-code API** can burn the dollars**: One member suggested using **claude-code** to generate data for benchmarks, dashboard and throwaway UIs, as LLMs are good at it and it’s so much worth it.
   - Some mad people on Twitter are running multiple instances of **Claude code** in parallel, *burning $500 in a weekend*.
- ****Claude** not bad in **Polars****: **Claude** and **Gemini** aren't bad in **Polars**, one member shared, noting that *you gotta tell him its with_columns now*.
   - It was also mentioned that **Claude 3.7** has no idea how to use the new updates, and that having competing information in the actual weights makes it much harder to overcome with context.

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro triggers rate limit woes**: Users report hitting the **20 requests/minute rate limit** with Gemini 2.5 Pro in Aider, even with minimal usage, suspecting background requests by Aider.
   - Some users are seeing **5 RPM** despite having tier 1 API keys, while others report seeing the documented **20 RPM** at tier 1, with screenshots provided like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1131200896827654149/1357114156037312683/image.png?ex=67efaf4c&is=67ee5dcc&hm=ab00c0d89a9a4029e1244032c897f52cf418c2b5c10a03543f8574d73b779750&).
- **Architect Mode saves Gemini Quota**: To conserve Gemini 2.5 Pro quota in architect mode, a user suggests setting `--editor-model sonnet` to offload editing tasks to a cheaper model like **Sonnet**.
   - One member stated that *you could try haiku I guess.. but even just 3.7 sonnet when it only does the editing is dirt cheap*.
- **Voice Command needs provider config**: Users are looking for configuration options to select voice models and providers for the `/voice` command, which currently uses **OpenAI Whisper**.
   - A pending PR ([https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/pull/3131](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/pull/3131)) may address this, allowing the use of different providers and models.
- **Code Actions Need MCP Love**: One user suggested that **LSP Code Actions and tree-sitter** can improve code editing and refactoring.
   - The member further pointed to the need for *MCPs for LSPs and treesitter for code editing, and it will speed up and make more robust these simple but large edits*.

> `LM Studio for Brave, System Prompt in Local Server, CUDA0 Buffer Allocation Failure, Q4 vs Q6 Model Quality, Dual GPU Setup with LM Studio` 


- **Brave New Integration for Local LLMs**: Users explored integrating **LM Studio** with the **Brave** browser, pointing its server endpoint to `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`, and sought guidance on configuring the **API** to utilize system prompts, with [lmstudioservercodeexamples](https://github.com/YorkieDev/lmstudioservercodeexamples) as a helpful resource.
   - Many struggled with providing Brave the correct API endpoint.
- **System Prompt: API Key to Unlocking LLM Potential**: To use **system prompts** with **LM Studio's local server**, users need to provide the prompt via the **API call**, not through the LM Studio interface, the documentation is available [here](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/app/api).
- **CUDA Conundrums: Memory Mayhem Strikes Again**: A *'failed to allocate cuda0 buffer'* error usually indicates insufficient memory for the model being used, and missing the **mmproj** file when downloading from **HF mirror** can cause the issue, which can be resolved by downloading from within **LM Studio** with proxy settings enabled.
- **Q4 vs Q6: Quality Quandaries**: The quality degradation between **Q4** and **Q6 models** depends on the model's size and recency, with older and smaller models suffering more noticeably, but a **32B model** should not have a significant impact.
- **Dual GPUs: Plug and Play Power?**: Users reported that utilizing dual **GPUs (4090 + 5090)** in **LM Studio** is surprisingly easy, achieving good performance (24-25 tokens/s) on a **32B Q8 model** with flash attention, though performance may be bottlenecked by **PCIE connection** when splitting models without **NVLink**.

- **Unsloth 2.0 6b solves problems despite slow speed**: A user reported running **Unsloth 2.0 6b** on 4x 3090 + 256GB RAM at ~3 tok/s and that it solved a coding problem in 20-30 minutes when smaller models and **ChatGPT** failed.
   - They found **Qwen QWQ** to be 90% of the quality of **R1** at 5% of the parameters, emphasizing preference for quality over speed.
- **M3 Ultra is not great for LLM, M4 Max is excellent!**: A user stated that the **M3 Ultra Mac Studio** is terrible for **LLM** use due to unbalanced memory, compute, and bandwidth, while the **M4 Max** and **5090** are excellent.
   - They argued the **M3 Ultra's** large VRAM is only suitable for gigantic MoE models and is overpriced for smaller models fitting in a **5090's 32GB VRAM** or a **M4 Max's 96GB**.
- **Apple Silicon bandwidth discussed**: A user clarified that the **M3 Ultra** has 800GB/s bandwidth for 512GB VRAM, while a **5090** has 1792GB/s for 32GB and an **M4 Max** has 546GB/s for 128GB.
   - Another user noted that the claim that the **M3 ultra** is *terrible* because it's *unbalanced* is ridiculous, as it still has way more bandwidth than even the **M4 max**, as did all previous ultra versions.
- **M4 Max vs M1 Ultra benchmarked**: A member pointed to [llama.cpp discussions](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/4167) showing roughly a tie between **M4 Max** and **M1 Ultra** for small, bandwidth-bound models, with **M1** pulling ahead for larger quants.

> `AI character platform, charactergateway.com` 


- **Character Gateway Launches for Devs**: A new AI character platform called [Character Gateway](https://charactergateway.com/) has launched, targeting developers with tools to create, manage, and deploy **AI characters/agents**.
   - The platform emphasizes simplicity with *no database, no prompt engineering, no subscription, [and] no new SDK*.
- **Character Gateway API Features Chat Completion**: Character Gateway enables users to generate characters and images, and send **/chat/completion requests** to characters using their own **OpenRouter** key.
   - The platform does not meter token usage, giving developers more control over costs; a feature to list trending public characters and integrate them into apps is a work in progress (**WIP**).

- **Gemini Guru to Guide Google's Gemini**: Josh Woodward will replace Sissie Hsaio as the leader of the Gemini team, preparing for *the next evolution of the Gemini app*, according to [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/642000/google-sissie-hsaio-stepping-down-notebooklm).
- **Safari Snafus Surface for Some NLM Users**: Some users reported issues accessing **NotebookLM** on **Safari** (iPhone/Mac), while others confirmed it's working on iPhone SE (2nd gen) by adding a shortcut to the Home screen.
   - If none of the primary language fixes work, adding `?hl=en` to the end of the URL (like this: `https://notebooklm.google.com/?hl=en`) should fix it.
- **Discover Sources Delight and Debut**: The **Discover Sources** feature is rolling out, expanding research capabilities beyond user-known information and mentioning interesting related topics, but is not yet available to everyone.
   - A user has suggested that academic online sources should be included, just like in perplexity.
- **Mind Map Maneuvering Mayhem**: Users noted that jumping from a mind map node to the chat area and back closes all nodes, requiring re-navigation, which the team is aware of.
- **Language Localization Lapses Leave Users Lugubrious**: Users are reporting that **changing the language** using the toggle in settings of the UI does nothing, and that **English** needs to be the primary language for the **Google** account.
   - Appending `?hl=en` to the end of the URL should also fix it.

- **Superior UX/UI Steals the Show**: Members discuss that winning startups often have better **UX/UI**, noting current products lack a *winning sauce*.
   - One user emphasizes developing a UI that defines requirements and page layouts, suggesting an agent swarm to generate web components in parallel, showcased in a [screen recording](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/986699377257119794/1357190780258746429/Screen_Recording_2025-04-03_at_1.39.26_pm.mov?ex=67eff6a9&is=67eea529&hm=9a8e202a73469a0749a23b81496240fd68a93a295583b0ce34cf52ff80c0c03e&).
- **Automated Wireframing Dreams**: One member is aiming to skip wireframing/design steps, and linked to a [Dribbble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/25708347-Delivery-Web-App-Design) for a web app dedicated to package tracking.
   - Another member wants a layout generator that designs grayscale wireframes, then refines and fills them with web components, using a swarm of agents.
- **GPT-4o Gets Quirky**: Users noted **GPT-4o** exhibiting unusual behavior, such as assuming a persona and adding parenthetical comments in its responses, illustrated in a [screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/986699377257119794/1357335757676871711/image.png?ex=67efd4ee&is=67ee836e&hm=4deb85a208466f212d88e7b77771776834fe28524ac15dc9c5dbcb1be3301ff3&).
   - Speculation arose regarding the source of this behavior, with theories ranging from an *EQ dataset* used in SFT to emergent properties; users also report GPT-4o becoming slower.
- **Google's Gemini 2.5 Claims Continuous Pretraining**: A member noted **Gemini 2.5** claims to be *continuously pretrained without a sharp knowledge cutoff*
   - The member pondered if this meant incremental model releases (2 -> 2.5 -> 3) or if it was a hallucination.
- **Dynamic NLP Systems: The Next Frontier**: A user believes the next generation of architectures will be dynamic, possessing both short and long-term memories.
   - They argued that NLP should treat language as a structured, evolving signal with flowing meaning rather than relying on a rigid tokenized format.

- **LLMs Bomb on USA Math Olympiad**: A member shared a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21934v1) evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on the **2025 USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO)**, where models like **O3-MINI** and **Claude 3.7** achieved less than **5%** on **six proof-based math problems**.
   - Each problem was scored out of **7 points**, with a max total score of **42**, and the models were trained on all imaginable math data, including **IMO problems**, **USAMO archives**, **textbooks**, and **papers**.
- **LLMs Grade Inflated on Math Tests**: The same models, including **O3-MINI** and **Claude 3.7**, overestimated their scores when grading their own work, inflating them by up to **20x** compared to human graders.
   - A discussion ensued on the implications of these findings, given the extensive training these models underwent with access to vast amounts of mathematical data.

> `OpenAI /v1/chat/completions API, conversation history, /v1/responses API, stateful vs stateless APIs` 


- **OpenAI's `/v1/chat/completions` API Costs Explained**: A member stated that with OpenAI's `/v1/chat/completions` API, you must send the complete conversation history with each new prompt, as described in the [OpenAI Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/conversation-state?api-mode=chat).
   - They also said that even if the input tokens' KV cache isn't evicted, you're still charged for those input tokens.
- **Stateful API alternative coming: `/v1/responses`**: The member pointed out that the newer `/v1/responses` API will be stateful, allowing reference to past messages via IDs, according to the [Responses vs Chat Completions documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions).
   - The new API will contrast with the `/v1/chat/completions` API, which is stateless and requires manual resending of the entire chat history.

> `cudaMemcpyAsync Overlap, cuBLAS matmul low occupancy, Registers in CUDA` 


- **Question on Overlapping `cudaMemcpyAsync` Copies**: A member inquired whether it's possible to overlap host to device copies when using `cudaMemcpyAsync` with pinned memory and separate streams in separate CPU threads.
   - The member noted having **5 copy engines** but expressed uncertainty if this enables overlapping copies.
- **`cuBLAS` Occupancy stays low due to latency hiding**: A member reported a low occupancy of around **20%** during a `cuBLAS` matmul of very large matrices in `nsys` and inquired why it wasn't higher.
   - Another member clarified that *high occupancy is needed to hide latencies* and that the `cuBLAS` code is written such that few warps are enough to saturate the arithmetic units of the GPU, with memory access latencies hidden at the software level.
- **CUDA Registers and Threads detailed**: A member asked that if an instruction computes a tile of **64x256**, shouldn't be needed **128 registers per thread**?
   - A member was watching a video where it was mentioned that **256 registers per thread** are needed for this operation.

> `AMD talk on TunableOp, NVIDIA pre-tuning in CuBLAS, NVSHMEM-based kernels for MoE models` 


- **AMD's TunableOp: PyTorch's Auto-Tune Gambit**: AMD introduced **TunableOp** in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cuda.tunable.html), a prototype feature that allows users to select the fastest implementation for operations like GEMMs, potentially using different libraries or techniques.
   - The feature is enabled separately from the tuning phase, and aims to optimize performance across various hardware configurations.
- **NVIDIA Bakes the Best: Pre-tuned CuBLAS Dominance**: A member noted that NVIDIA already pre-tunes everything and bakes it into **CuBLAS**, potentially giving it an edge over AMD's more configurable approach.
   - The pre-tuning might be less optimized for consumer GPUs but still provides a solid baseline.
- **NVSHMEM Kernels supercharge Mixture-of-Experts**: **PPLXDevs** announced [custom NVSHMEM-based kernels](https://x.com/pplxdevs/status/1907547685579796933?s=46) for **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** models, promising up to **10x faster communication** compared to standard all-to-all operations.
   - Their approach balances performance with adaptability across different hardware configurations, making it a potentially valuable tool for MoE model development.

> `Activation Checkpointing, CUDA Compilation, C vs C++ in CUDA` 


- **Activation Checkpointing during Inference**: A member inquired about **activation checkpointing** during inference and shared a [paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01792) for reference.
   - He mentioned seeing the reference and **CUDA compilation** image before, but is still trying to understand the concept.
- **CUDA Compiler Magically Interprets C and C++**: A member expressed surprise that the **CUDA compiler** can deduce whether code written in a `.cu` file is **C or C++** and compile accordingly.
   - He noted that starting to write in either **C or C++** within a `.cu` file leads the compiler to *deduce the code as C code and starts compiling Cuda as usual*.
- **C/C++ Compatibility within CUDA Compilation**: A member explained that **C++** is syntactically close to being a superset of **C**, and the `nvcc` compiler bridges additional gaps.
   - He questioned whether the code is truly compiled as **C code** (using **C linkage and symbol names**) or if the **C code** is simply also valid **C++ code**.

> `LLMs for extraction, Genstruct-7B, Ada-Instruct` 


- **LLMs Extracting Data Sets**: A member inquired about using **LLMs for extraction** to create datasets from unstructured PDFs.
   - Another member suggested that it might be better to prompt a larger model, but linked to **Genstruct-7B** as a good starting point, to create synthetic instruction finetuning datasets from any raw-text corpus.
- **Genstruct-7B Generates instructions**: [Genstruct 7B](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Genstruct-7B) is an **instruction-generation model**, designed to create valid instructions given a raw text corpus.
   - This approach was inspired by [Ada-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04484) which trained a custom instruction-generation model, and also by a [github repo](https://github.com/edmundman/OllamaGenstruct) for quick use with ollama and a bunch of pdfs.

> `Cohere Status Page, Python logging vs print statements, RAG strategy for documents` 


- **Cohere hit by Degraded Performance!**: Some users reported experiencing **http timeout errors** and confirmed the [Cohere Status Page](https://status.cohere.com/) indicated *Degraded Performance - Increased Latency* for **Command-a-03-2025/command-r-plus-08-2024** models.
   - The issue was being monitored and had been ongoing for **4 hours**.
- **Python Logging: Teammates Disagree!**: A member is developing their first Python package for PDF processing and is in disagreement with a senior teammate over whether to use **logs** or **print statements**.
   - The member prefers logs for **different levels, file saving, searchability, and issue reporting**, while the teammate prefers **print statements** to avoid burdening users; a compromise of a **disabled logger instance by default** was suggested.
- **RAG Strategy: Chunk or Not to Chunk Long Documents?**: A member asked about using a **18000 token document** for **RAG** and whether to cut it up.
   - An expert recommends chopping the documents, but it depends on the end goal and requirements, also suggesting that **Command-a's 256k context window**, and **command-r and r-plus's 128k context window** should easily be able to handle it.
