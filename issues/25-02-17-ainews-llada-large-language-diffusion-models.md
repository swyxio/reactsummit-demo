  **LLaDA (Large Language Diffusion Model) 8B** is a breakthrough
  diffusion-based language model that rivals **LLaMA 3 8B** while training on
  **7x fewer tokens (2 trillion tokens)** and using **0.13 million H800 GPU
  hours**. It introduces a novel text generation approach by predicting
  uniformly masked tokens in a diffusion process, enabling multi-turn dialogue
  and instruction-following. Alongside, **StepFun AI** released two major
  models: **Step-Video-T2V 30B**, a text-to-video model generating up to **204
  frames** with high coherence and motion quality, and **Step-Audio-Chat 132B**,
  a voice-to-voice model. Additionally, challenging multimodal benchmarks like
  **Scale AI's EnigmaEval** and **Cambridge's ZeroBench** highlight current
  frontier models scoring zero, emphasizing the difficulty of these tasks. The
  community also noted the return of diffusion models in language modeling, a
  previously speculative architecture now scaled successfully.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Chinese AI is all you need?**

> AI News for 2/14/2025-2/17/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**211** channels, and **11039** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **1163 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

There was something today for everyone.

Ahead of the expected [Grok 3 release](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1890958798841389499) late tonight on a US holiday, today was a notable day of small things. Either:

- **the big model releases** of the day were the two StepFun models, [Step-Video-T2V](https://x.com/bdsqlsz/status/1891348664460714425?s=46) (30B Text to Video with remarkable coherence, including the famously hard ballerinas that Sora gets wrong) and [Step-Audio-Chat](https://huggingface.co/stepfun-ai/Step-Audio-Chat), a 132B voice to voice model
- or you could look at Scale AI's [EnigmaEval](https://x.com/alexandr_wang/status/1891208692751638939?s=46) (very hard multimodal puzzles) or Cambridge's [ZeroBench]( https://x.com/jrobertsai/status/1891506671056261413?s=46) (100 manually-curated multi-step visual reasoning questions) **evals where current frontier models score 0.**
- or you could look at [Schulman and Zoph's latest talk on post-training](https://x.com/johnschulman2/status/1891539960743743756).

But we choose to award today's title story to [LLaDA: Large Language Diffusion Models](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/), the first text diffusion model scaled up to be competitive with autoregressive models like Llama 3 8B.

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/007f0b39-2759-4568-93a6-b7c97ff6055a.png?w=960&fit=max)

This is a "white whale" alternative LLM architecture that has only been speculated about but never successfully scaled up til now. The main trick is adapting diffusion to predict uniformly masked tokens, producing text in a diffusion process:

![https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/static/images/diff_normal_150ms.gif](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/static/images/diff_normal_150ms.gif)

For those used to text streaming in from left to right, diffusion doesn't seem very practical... until you try to infill between preset text structures and word choices that you desire, or create coherent long form story structures. LLaDA could be the start of something much bigger here.
