<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI Discords for 2/13-15/2024. We checked **20** guilds, **312** channels, and **10550** messages for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **909 minutes**. Due to a config bug we summarized 2.5 days worth of conversations by accident.

If you're reading this you probably are aware of the absolute mayhem unleashed the day after Valentine's. We covered Gemini 1.5 and Sora on a [live ThursdAI podcast](https://sub.thursdai.news/p/thursdai-feb-15-2024-openai-changes) so you can get our takes there, but also we have been tracking the must-see and must-know Sora takes on the Latent Space discord. Of course, we weren't alone.

- **Exploring In-Loop Index Order Optimization**: `@eporat` mentioned that instead of in-place transposing, changing the order of indices in the inner loop might be a viable optimization. However, `@andreaskoepf` seems unsure about the improvements as the data would be read transposed in any case.

- **Altering For-Loop Variables Slows Down Performance**: `@eporat` tested changes in a CUDA kernel, only to find that changing the order of loop variables made the function even slower. They shared a modified function with an `atomicAdd` operation, but it failed to work efficiently with shared memory.

- **Google Unveils Gemini 1.5 Pro**: `@tariqali` shared a [Google Developers blog post](https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/02/gemini-15-available-for-private-preview-in-google-ai-studio.html?m=1) announcing the private preview of Google's *Gemini 1.5 Pro*, which reportedly has the same performance as *Gemini 1.0 Ultra* but uses less compute. It also referenced the model's ability to handle a context window of 1 million tokens.
  
- **Expanding the Context Window**: In discussing the importance of prompt engineering with larger context windows, `@tariqali` speculated that the need for prompt engineering could decrease as the ability to input more relevant data directly increases. They considered the possibility that the cheaper compute might outweigh the efforts of prompt engineering, potentially rendering it an antiquated skill.

- **Gemini's Potential Constraints**: Following up, `@tariqali` highlighted a line from the [Google Blog](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/) indicating that Google has successfully tested models with up to 10 million tokens, but chose to release *Gemini 1.5* with a 1 million token context window instead. They inferred that there might be significant constraints, such as cost, preventing the release of models with larger context windows, suggesting that prompt engineering may still be valuable in the short term.
