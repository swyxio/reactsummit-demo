<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Transformers are SSMs.**

> AI News for 5/31/2024-6/3/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**400** channels, and **8575** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **877 minutes**.

Over the weekend we got [the FineWeb Technical Report](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1) (which we [covered a month ago](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-fineweb-15t-tokens-of-commoncrawl/)), and it turns out that it does improve upon CommonCrawl and RefinedWeb with better filtering and deduplication.

However we give the weekend W to the Mamba coauthors, who are somehow [back again with Mamba-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21060), a core [30 lines of Pytorch](https://goombalab.github.io/blog/2024/mamba2-part3-algorithm/#the-code) which outperforms Mamba and Transformer++ in both perplexity and wall-clock time.

Tri recommends [reading the blog first](https://goombalab.github.io/blog/2024/mamba2-part1-model/), developing Mamba-2 over 4 parts:

1. **The Model**
  - **Understanding**: What are the conceptual connections between state space models and attention? Can we combine them?
   > As developed in our earlier works on structured SSMs, they seem to capture the essence of **continuous, convolutional, and recurrent** sequence models – all wrapped up in a simple and elegant model.
  - **Efficiency**: Can we speed up the training of Mamba models by recasting them as matrix multiplications?
  > Despite the work that went into making Mamba fast, it’s still much less hardware-efficient than mechanisms such as attention.
  - The core difference between Mamba and Mambda-2 is a stricter diagonalization of their A matrix:  ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/7592290b-b389-4ce9-a8ee-3894b7775acd.png?w=960&fit=max) Using this definition the authors prove equivalence (duality) between Quadratic Mode (Attention) and Linear Mode (SSMs), and unlocks matrix multiplications.

2. The Theory
  - ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/e1d636ae-0b08-433e-abd0-68b986d3cf56.png?w=960&fit=max) 
3. The Algorithm
  - [https://goombalab.github.io/blog/2024/mamba2-part3-algorithm/#the-code ](https://goombalab.github.io/blog/2024/mamba2-part3-algorithm/#the-code )
4. The Systems
  - they show that Mamba-2 both beats Mamba-1 and Pythia on evals, and dominate in evals when placed in hybrid model archs similar to Jamba:

- **Handle int64 overflows in Triton**: Members discussed issues related to int64 overflows in Triton. One member suggested using `(indices*stride).to(tl.int64)` but acknowledged it isn't ideal, while another pointed out that upcasting one factor first avoids overflow and mentioned annotating the kernel signature as another solution. [Issue #1211](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/issues/1211).

- **clang-tidy warnings for Triton**: A user suggested that Triton implement warnings like those from `clang-tidy` to catch potential int overflow issues. Specifically, a warning such as "Result of 32-bit integer multiplication used as pointer offset" could be beneficial.

- **Annotations for large tensors**: A suggestion was made to use annotations to handle large tensors more gracefully, referencing a specific [GitHub issue #832](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/issues/832). It involved using a decorator to set up proper type signatures to avoid overflow.

- **Memory allocation in Triton**: Questions arose about whether memory allocation functions like `tl.zeros` and `tl.full` use shared memory on SRAM or VRAM. One user assumed VRAM is used until the memory is actually needed.

- **Performance in triton.language.sum**: There was a newbie question about whether `triton.language.sum` performs as a normal for-loop or as a parallel reduction. Another user confirmed it is indeed a parallel reduction, suitable for block-level parallel operations.
