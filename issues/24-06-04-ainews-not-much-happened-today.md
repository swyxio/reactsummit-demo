Se trata de Emily Pellegrini, quien ha ganado millas de seguidores en las &#xfa;ltimas semanas al crear un perfil en una plataforma para adultos, desafiando al conocido Onlyfans. En las redes sociales, la propagaci&#xf3;n de influencers generados con Inteligencia Artificial (IA) est&#xe1; en aumento. Ahora, una modelo que vende contenido para adultos se est&#xe1; volviendo viral en Instagram: Emily Pellegrini, de 21 a&#xf1;os, ha acumulado millas de seguidores en la popular plataforma.

La influencer ha generado ingresos cercanos a los 10 mil d&#xf3;lares en tan solo seis semanas gracias al contenido que vende a trav&#xe9;s de Fanvue, una plataforma para adultos que compite con Onlyfans. A pesar de &quot;vivir&quot; en Italia, la peculiaridad de Emily Pellegrini es que todas sus im&#xe1;genes son creadas mediante IA, un m&#xe9;todo que ha ganado popularidad en los &#xfa;ltimos meses en internet.

La cuota de suscripci&#xf3;n mensual es de aproximadamente nueve d&#xf3;lares, y ya cuenta con cerca de 100 suscriptores regulares. La popularidad de Emily Pellegrini ha alcanzado tal nivel que, en apenas seis semanas, ha acumulado casi 90 mil seguidores en Instagram. Incluso en su perfil de redes sociales, tiene una secci&#xf3;n de historias destacadas donde aparece con &quot;amigas&quot;, que son otros modelos de la plataforma creadas con IA.

La fama de Emily Pellegrini ha llegado tan lejos que el reconocido medio internacional New York Post le dedic&#xf3; un art&#xed;culo tanto a ella como a la plataforma Fanvue. Esta plataforma es similar a Onlyfans, pero con la particularidad de que todos los modelos son exclusivamente creados con IA.

El fundador del sitio, Will Monange, sostiene que la IA es una &quot;herramienta&quot; y una &quot;extensi&#xf3;n de lo que somos y lo que hacemos&quot;, una diferencia de lo que otras personas consideran como un reemplazo de la creatividad humana.&quot;</a>: 1,779 likes, 13 comments - tucumandigital on January 2, 2024: &quot;#INCRE&#xcd;BLE &#x1f534; LA MODELO QUE LA ROMPE EN UNA PLATAFORMA PARA ADULTOS PERO NO ES REAL &#x1f62e;  Se trata de Emily Pellegr...</li><li><a href="https://github.com/jaisidhsingh/CoN-CLIP">GitHub - jaisidhsingh/CoN-CLIP</a>: Contribute to jaisidhsingh/CoN-CLIP development by creating an account on GitHub.</li><li><a href="https://civitai.com/models/432244/forrealxl">ForRealXL - v0.5 | Stable Diffusion Checkpoint | Civitai</a>: Hello ♥ for whatever reason you want to show me appreciation, you can: ❤️ Ko-Fi ❤️ This is an experimental Checkpoint because its my first.

- **Transformers vs. State-Space Models Rivalry Sparks Interest**: A shared paper ([arxiv.org/abs/2405.21060](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21060)) discusses how state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba can outperform Transformers and introduces the **State Space Duality (SSD)** framework that enhances model efficiency. The new architecture, **Mamba-2**, is 2-8X faster than its predecessor and competitive with Transformers in language modeling.

- **Tiny Bit Methods Criticized**: Queries about the effectiveness of the 1.58-bit method reveal general skepticism and negative feedback. Users report that *"everyone I know who has tried these tiny bit methods say they suck."*

- **Diffusion Models Thrive on Data Corruption**: A preprint ([arxiv.org/abs/2405.20494](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20494)) suggests that slight corruption in pretraining datasets can enhance the quality and diversity of generated images in diffusion models (DMs). The paper introduces **Conditional Embedding Perturbation (CEP)**, showing that intentional data corruption benefits model training.

- **Concerns on Large Diffusion Models and Overfitting**: Discussions highlight concerns about large diffusion models, particularly those over 500 million parameters, overfitting on datasets like ImageNet. Dropout and data augmentation are mentioned as methods to combat overfitting.

- **Debate on Robustness and Model Training Difficulty**: The conversation explores how increasing training data difficulty might improve model robustness. Referencing [Distill.pub's article on interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/), the intuition that *"increasing the difficulty of tasks during optimization creates better models"* is considered plausible, although quantifying this effect remains a challenge.

- **Daylight tablet debate sparks controversy**: Members debated the claims in [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/iHeIw9rXzUQ?si=QDETgMaKJTaTYLkV) reviewing the Daylight tablet, questioning its advertising as an e-paper device. Many argued that it is misleadingly similar to E-ink but is in fact a reflective LCD, sparking discontent about its price and features compared to devices like iPads and Kindles.
  
- **Innovation vs. Mislabeling in e-paper technology**: The discussion highlighted the fine line between innovation and mislabeling, as users argued that the Daylight tablet claiming to have invented new RLCD technology felt misleading. Critics raised concerns about their claims of superior FPS and daylight visibility while others pointed out it might merely be branded over existing Sharp RLCD technology.

- **Battery life concerns for new devices**: Battery life comparisons also arose, with some highlighting the Kindle's weeks-long battery life versus the Daylight tablet's claim of lasting multiple days to a week. This raised skepticism about the practicality of the new device as a daily-use tablet for activities like notetaking and drawing under sunlight.

- **Skepticism about founding claims**: Arguments extended to suspecting the authenticity of the e-paper claims, with some users noting the presence of the founder outside a Sharp factory as indicative of merely using pre-existing Sharp technology rather than innovating. This skepticism was met with rebuttals emphasizing the absence of direct evidence proving or disproving the novel technology claims.

- **A call to investigate further with potential teardown**: The debate concluded with the suggestion that a teardown of the Daylight tablet could potentially reveal the true nature of its tech, comparing it to an existing Sharp RLCD. The theoretical discussions remained inconclusive without physical verification, potentially waiting for someone to provide concrete evidence to settle the argument.

- **Debate over `async` by Default in Mojo**: A member suggested that every function in Mojo should be implicitly `async` to avoid blocking issues, particularly for GPU programming where blocking is unacceptable. Others raised concerns about deviating from Pythonic practices and potential difficulties for users with an explicit `async`/`await` mindset.

- **Community Feedback on `async` Proposal**: The suggestion to make `async` the default sparked mixed reactions. Some argued for keeping functions synchronous to maintain compatibility with Python and ease the transition for Python programmers, while others pointed out the need for efficient scheduling and suspension mechanisms in GPU programming.

- **JSON Parsing Clarification**: There was a query about the endianness of JSON and parsing conventions. It was clarified that JSON is a text format usually in UTF-8, which is endian-independent, and that indexing `[1:-1]` is used to omit the enclosing brackets during parsing.

- **Issue Reporting and Tool Support Requests**: Members discussed potential bugs in the code assistant regarding relative imports and encouraged filing bug reports. Additionally, issues were created on GitHub for tools like `tokei` and `tcount` to add Mojo support, with requests for others to support these issues ([Tokei Issue](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei/issues/1107), [TCount Issue](https://github.com/RRethy/tcount/issues/3)).
