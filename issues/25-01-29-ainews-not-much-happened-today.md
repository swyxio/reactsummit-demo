> `Mixture-of-Experts Models, Autonomy-of-Experts Paradigm` 


- **MoE Models Need Better Expert Selection**: The paper argues that the separation of the router's decision-making from the experts' execution leads to suboptimal expert selection in **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** models, which often underperforms compared to dense models.
   - *To address this issue*, the authors propose a new paradigm called **Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE)** where experts autonomously select themselves based on their capacity to process inputs.
- **Experts Rank Themselves for Processing**: In the **AoE** framework, routers are removed and experts pre-compute internal activations for inputs, ranking themselves based on activation norms.
   - Consequently, only the **top-ranking experts** move forward in the process while the others abort, enhancing the efficiency of expert utilization.

> `Mixture-of-Experts models, Autonomy-of-Experts paradigm, Router decision-making in MoE` 


- **MoE Models Struggle with Expert Selection**: Current **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** models rely on a router for token assignment, which often leads to suboptimal learner effectiveness and expert selection.
   - The need for improvement in expert selections and learning is underscored by the proposal of *Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE)*, eliminating router dependency.
- **Introducing Autonomy in Expert Selection**: The **Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE)** paradigm allows experts to autonomously determine their suitability for processing input by evaluating their internal activation norms.
   - In this approach, only the top-ranking experts proceed with further calculation, leading to potentially more efficient processing.
