Anthropic wrote about [Contextrual Retrieval](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval), a RAG technique that takes advantage of their prompt caching feature, showing that Reranked Contextual Embedding and Contextual BM25 reduced the top-20-chunk retrieval failure rate by 67% (5.7% → 1.9%):

However this is just a RAG technique so we didnt feel it was title story worthy.

Team Meta is [heavily](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fkyiim/metas_llama_has_become_the_dominant_platform_for/) [teasing](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fl2l86/zuck_is_teasing_llama_multimodal_over_on_ig/) multimodal Llama 3 at next week's Meta Connect, but we can't make it the headline story until it's out.
