## [DiscoResearch](https://discord.com/channels/1178995845727785010) Discord Summary

Only 1 channel had activity, so no need to summarize...

- **Custom MoE models**: `@jp1` discussed a **custom 2bit quant with 4 experts** that has *consistent output up to 500 tokens*. They offered a link to the **experimental quants of 4 expert MoE mixtrals in various GGUF formats** on Hugging Face [here](https://huggingface.co/nisten/quad-mixtrals-gguf).
- **4 Expert MoE Mixtrals**: The goal, according to `@jp1`, is to create the **best-performing MoE below 10GB**. Also, they shared **experimental q8 and q4 files** available for training and finetuning, specifying that *"No sparsity tricks yet"* have been used.
- **Installation of Llama.cpp**: `@jp1` provided a brief guide to download and run llama.cpp from Github, concluding that their 8.4GB **custom 2bit quant** works okay until 512 token lengths, after which it starts looping.
