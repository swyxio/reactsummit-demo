**Theme 2. LLM Quantization: Balancing Model Size and Performance**

- **Llama 8B in... BITNETS!!!** ([Score: 75, Comments: 27](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fjtm86/llama_8b_in_bitnets/)): **Llama 3.1 8B** has been converted to a **bitnet** equivalent using **HuggingFace's** extreme quantization technique, achieving **1.58 bits per weight**. The resulting model's performance is reportedly comparable to **Llama 1** and **Llama 2**, demonstrating significant compression while maintaining effectiveness. More details about this conversion process and its implications can be found in the [HuggingFace blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/1_58_llm_extreme_quantization).
  - Users appreciated the **transparency** in the blog post about unsuccessful attempts, noting this is often missing from ML papers. There's a call for more incentives to publish "this didn't work" research to improve efficiency in the field.
  - The conversion process is not a full ground-up training of **Llama 3** in **bitnet**, but rather a form of fine-tuning after conversion. For **bitnet** to be truly effective, models need to be pre-trained with bitnet in mind from the start.
  - The change in **perplexity** isn't significantly different from quantization to a similar **bits per weight (BPW)**. However, this conversion process is still considered a technical feat and may lead to future improvements in minimizing perplexity changes.


- **Which is better? Large model with higher quant vs Small model with higher precision** ([Score: 53, Comments: 25](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fjo7zx/which_is_better_large_model_with_higher_quant_vs/)): The post compares the performance of **large quantized models** versus **smaller high-precision models**, specifically mentioning **gemma2:27b-instruct-q4_K_S (16GB)** and **gemma2:9b-instruct-fp16 (16GB)** as examples. The author admits to habitually choosing smaller, higher-precision models but questions if this approach is optimal, seeking community input on preferences and experiences with these different model configurations.
  - **Larger quantized models** generally outperform smaller high-precision models, as shown in a [graph comparing quantization vs. perplexity](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1441jnr/k_quantization_vs_perplexity/). A **70B model** at 4-bit quantization typically surpasses an **8B model** at full precision due to more internal token relationship representations.
  - A user compared various quantizations of **Gemma2 27B and 9B** models on Ollama, providing [benchmark results](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1etzews/interesting_results_comparing_gemma2_9b_and_27b/) to help others make informed decisions. The community expressed appreciation for this practical comparison.
  - Quantization effectiveness varies, with a general rule of thumb suggesting larger models remain superior down to about **3 bits per weight (bpw)**. Below this threshold, performance may degrade significantly, especially for **Q1/Q2** quantizations, while **Q3** or **IQ3/IQ4** maintain better quality.


**Theme 3. Qwen2.5: Impressive New Model Family Outperforming Larger Competitors**

- **Qwen2.5: A Party of Foundation Models!** ([Score: 96, Comments: 46](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fjxkxy/qwen25_a_party_of_foundation_models/)): Alibaba's **Qwen2.5** model family has been released, featuring foundation models ranging from **0.5B to 72B** parameters.

  - **Qwen2.5-72B** outperforms **Llama3.1-405B** on several benchmarks, including **MMLU-redux** (86.8% vs 86.2%) and **MATH** (83.1% vs 73.8%), while the **32B** and **14B** versions show impressive performance comparable to larger models.
  - The models were trained on up to **18 trillion tokens**, with the **14B** model achieving an **MMLU score of 80**, demonstrating exceptional efficiency and performance for its size, potentially closing the gap with closed-source alternatives in terms of cost-effectiveness.

- **Just replaced Llama 3.1 70B @ iQ2S for Qwen 2.5 32B @ Q4KM** ([Score: 122, Comments: 38](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fkbumy/just_replaced_llama_31_70b_iq2s_for_qwen_25_32b/)): **Qwen 2.5 32B** model has outperformed **Llama 3.1 70B** in user testing on a single **P40** GPU, demonstrating superior performance across general use cases including web search, question answering, and writing assistance. The model is noted to be less censored than vanilla Llama 3.1 and supports system prompts, surpassing **Gemma 2 27B** in capabilities, though there's potential for further improvement through ablation or fine-tuning to remove refusals.
  - **Qwen2.5 32B** outperformed **Llama 3.1 70B** in user testing, with superior results across various tasks including **math questions**, **proverbs**, **article summarization**, and **code generation**. The model excelled in both **English and Italian** language tasks.
  - Users expressed interest in an **uncensored version** of the 32B model, similar to the "Tiger" models. The **Qwen2.5 32B** model demonstrated less censorship compared to its predecessor, notably discussing the **1989 Tiananmen Square protests**.
  - The model runs efficiently on consumer hardware, with the **32B version** fitting on a **24GB VRAM** card at 4-bit quantization. It's compatible with **Ollama** and **OpenVINO**, offering performance gains for both GPU and CPU inference.


**Theme 4. OpenAI's Strawberry Model: Controversy Over Reasoning Transparency**

- **OpenAI Threatening to Ban Users for Asking Strawberry About Its Reasoning** ([Score: 151, Comments: 59](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fjurs1/openai_threatening_to_ban_users_for_asking/)): The article discusses **OpenAI's** apparent threat to **ban users** who inquire about the reasoning behind its **"Strawberry" model**. This action seems to contradict OpenAI's stated mission of being "here to help," raising questions about the company's transparency and user engagement policies. The post links to a [Futurism article](https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-ban-strawberry-reasoning) for more details on the situation.
  - Users criticized **OpenAI's** lack of transparency, with **HideLord** pointing out the "trust me bro" situation where users pay for unseen reasoning tokens. The **o1 model** was described as potentially inefficient, with limited weekly messages and questionable UI design.
  - Discussions centered on the model's apparent lack of censorship in its internal reasoning, with **Zeikos** suggesting OpenAI fears bad PR if uncensored thoughts are revealed. Some users argued that censoring models significantly impacts performance.
  - The open-source community was mentioned as a potential alternative, with projects like **[rStar](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.06195v1)** being highlighted as a possible "strawberry at home" solution. However, fragmentation in open-source userbases was noted as a challenge.
