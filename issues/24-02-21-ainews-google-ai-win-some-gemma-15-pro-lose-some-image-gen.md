- **Inquiries about MCQ Dataset Evaluation**: `@aloo_kachalu.` sought advice on how to calculate likelihood for MCQ dataset evaluation and was pointed by `@baber_` to a [Hugging Face blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/evaluating-mmlu-leaderboard) for a detailed explanation.

- **Log Likelihood's Availability in Evaluation Harness**: `@hailey_schoelkopf` explained that tasks requiring log likelihood calculations for model evaluations, like `loglikelihood`, `loglikelihood_rolling`, `multiple_choice`, cannot be run on API models that do not provide log probabilities (logits).

- **Resolving Out of Memory Errors in Evaluation**: `@pminervini` faced an issue where `evaluator.simple_evaluate` caused an Out of Memory (OOM) error and the allocated memory did not release on a V100 GPU. Suggestions included wrapping code in `try...except` and explicitly deleting model instances, but ultimately, restarting the runtime was the only solution.

- **Running Gemma 7b Model in Evaluation Harness**: Users experienced issues running the Gemma 7b model, with failures and reshaping errors reported by `.rand0mm` and poor scoring issues brought up by `@vraychev`. `@hailey_schoelkopf` confirmed that non-flash-attention implementations of this model had recently been patched and provided a diff snippet to fix score evaluation issues.

- **Clarifications on Task Types for the Evaluation Harness**: When `@dsajlkdasdsakl` asked about a custom task in the evaluation harness causing an error with API models, `@hailey_schoelkopf` clarified that tasks with `output_type` of `generate_until` do not require logits and can be used with API models that only return generated text.

- **Confusion over Dropout in ParallelMLP**: `@jdranpariya` pointed out a confusing comment in `ParallelMLP` class that suggests a dropout is applied, but it's not visible in the provided code snippets. The comment in question alludes to a dropout at the end of an MLP process, although its implementation isn't immediately apparent.
- **Clarification on Dropout Implementation**: `@stellaathena` clarified that the dropout is actually applied in the construction of the transformer layer, providing a [link to the relevant code](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/blob/f7373f806689cb270677dd48bffddf4a32bfadce/megatron/model/transformer.py#L833). They indicated that the comment within `ParallelMLP` might be misleading.
- **Misleading Comment Acknowledged**: `@jdranpariya` agreed that the comment might need modification to prevent confusion about dropout application within `ParallelMLP`. However, they also expressed reluctance to commit changes solely for a comment correction.
- **Dropout Code Block Identified**: In a follow-up message, `@jdranpariya` identified the block of code where dropout is actually applied, which involves a dropout function followed by a residual addition, as per the transformer layer's construction.
