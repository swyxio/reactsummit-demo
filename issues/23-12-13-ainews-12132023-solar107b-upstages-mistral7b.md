  the **phi-2** base model were released, trained on **1.4 trillion tokens**
  including synthetic texts created by GPT-3 and filtered by GPT-4, using **96
  A100 GPUs** over 14 days. On **OpenAI's** Discord, users discussed challenges
  with various **GPT** models, including incoherent outputs, API usage
  limitations, and issues with **GPT-4 Vision API**. Conversations also covered
  understanding **AGI** and **ASI**, concerns about OpenAI's partnership with
  Axel Springer, and pricing changes for GPT Plus. Discussions included the

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->Upstage's 10.7B [model was released](https://huggingface.co/upstage/SOLAR-10.7B-Instruct-v1.0):

> We developed the Depth Up-Scaling technique. Built on the Llama2 architecture, SOLAR-10.7B incorporates the innovative Upstage Depth Up-Scaling. We then integrated Mistral 7B weights into the upscaled layers, and finally, continued pre-training for the entire model.

The Nous community thinks it's good but not great.

In other news, weights for [the Phi-2 base model](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38634490) were released - it's 1.4T tokens of Phi 1.5 + 250B worth of new GPT3-created synthetic texts and GPT4-filtered websites trained over 96 A100s for 14 days.

## [DiscoResearch](https://discord.com/channels/1178995845727785010) Discord Summary

- Focus on **OpenAI's new chat version**, trained on the **Prometheus dataset**. Participants wondered whether this had contributed to the reported improved performance, despite the dataset containing no code-related examples. Reference to OpenChat's detailed description on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat-3.5-1210#%F0%9F%A23%91%E2%9A%96%EF%B8%8F-experimental-evaluator--feedback-capabilities).
- Discussions about **Mixture of Experts** (MoE) indicate that orthogonality between experts might result in better performance. The concept of **lower order rank approximation** of individual experts was also brought up. Other topics included dynamic allocation of experts based on a set minimum threshold and custom MoE routing.
- The **QuIP# method** was discussed. This is a weights-only quantization method that allows a model to achieve near fp16 performance using 2 bits per weight and operate on an 11G GPU. Find more details on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cornell-RelaxML/quip-sharp) and the model in question on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Minami-su/Yi_34B_Chat_2bit).
- Conversation around **OpenSource German embedding models** with reference to Deutsche Telekom's models and Jina's forthcoming German embedding model. Also mentioned were upcoming models based on **LeoLM Mistral 7B, LeoLM Llama2 70B, and Mixtral 8x7B**.
- Debates on the **effectiveness of EQ Bench**, in light of potential subjectivity in emotional evaluations. Agreement that subjectivity in emotional intelligence measurement presents a challenge.
- Debate about **Mixtral's performance** despite reports that the model seems "smarter" than other 7B models. Several models were tested during the evaluation, and the possibility was proposed that a base 7B model may limit certain types of cognition, which might also affect role-playing and creative writing tasks.

- **Concerns about Sharing Code on GitHub**: User `@rtyax` expressed hesitation about sharing their code on GitHub due to potential privacy issues. They, however, considered creating a new GitHub account to sidestep this concern.
- **EQ Bench and Subjectivity in Emotion Evaluation**: `@_jp1_` pointed out that the EQ Bench could be influenced by subjectivity in emotions assessment and suggested conducting a comparative study of expert evaluations. `@calytrix` agreed that emotional intelligence measurement's inherent subjectivity is a challenge, but still believes the EQ Bench can effectively discriminate between different responses.
- **Questions about Mixtral's Performance**: `@_jp1_` also questioned why **Mixtral's** performance wasn't as high as expected. `@calytrix` responded that they used the specified tokenisation and tested several models including: DiscoResearch/mixtral-7b-8expert, mattshumer/mistral-8x7b-chat, mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, migtissera/Synthia-MoE-v3-Mixtral-8x7B. They hypothesized that having a base 7b model might limit certain types of cognition and expect this might also impact role playing & creative writing tasks.
- **Subjective Perceptions of Model Performance**: `@technotech` remarked that despite the lower performance scores, in their subjective opinion, the **Mixtral model** seems “much smarter” than other 7B models.
