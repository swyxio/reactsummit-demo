description: >-
  **Ziming Liu**, a grad student of **Max Tegmark**, published a paper on
  **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)**, claiming they outperform **MLPs** in
  interpretability, inductive bias injection, function approximation accuracy,
  and scaling, despite being 10x slower to train but 100x more parameter
  efficient. KANs use learnable activation functions modeled by B-splines on
  edges rather than fixed activations on nodes. However, it was later shown that
  KANs can be mathematically rearranged back into MLPs with similar parameter
  counts, sparking debate on their interpretability and novelty. Meanwhile, on
  AI Twitter, there is speculation about a potential **GPT-5** release with
  mixed impressions, OpenAI's adoption of the **C2PA metadata standard** for
  detecting AI-generated images with high accuracy for **DALL-E 3**, and
  **Microsoft** training a large 500B parameter model called **MAI-1**,
  potentially previewed at Build conference, signaling increased competition
  with OpenAI. *"OpenAI's safety testing for GPT-4.5 couldn't finish in time for
  Google I/O launch"* was also noted.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Are Learnable Activations all you need?**

> AI News for 5/6/2024-5/7/2024. We checked 7 subreddits and [**373** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **28** Discords (**419** channels, and **3749** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **414 minutes**.

Theory papers are usually above our paygrade, but that is enough drama and not enough else going on today that we have the space to write about it. A week ago, Max Tegmark's grad student [Ziming Liu published](https://twitter.com/ZimingLiu11/status/1785483967719981538) his very well written [paper on KANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756) (complete with [fully documented library](https://kindxiaoming.github.io/pykan/)), claiming them as almost universally equal to or superior to MLPs on many important dimensions like [interpretability](https://x.com/ZimingLiu11/status/1785489972218433627)/[inductive bias injection](https://x.com/ZimingLiu11/status/1785490122303287346), [function approximation accuracy](https://x.com/ZimingLiu11/status/1785489587122601997) and scaling (though is acknowledged to be currently [10x slower to train](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1chrafb/comment/l24eymi/) on current hardware on a same-param count basis, it is also [100x more param efficient](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1chrafb/comment/l24fp48/)).

> While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights").

Instead of layering preset activations like ReLu, KANs model "learnable activation functions" using [B-splines](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-085-computational-science-and-engineering-i-fall-2008/resources/lecture-21-boundary-conditions-splines-gradient-divergence/) (aka no linear weights, just curves) and [simple addition](https://twitter.com/predict_addict/status/1785696131436998681). People got excited, [rewriting GPTs with KANs](https://x.com/predict_addict/status/1787853844862378463).

One week on, it now turns out that [you can rearrange the KAN terms to arrive back at MLPs with the ~same number of params](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1clcu5i/d_kolmogorovarnold_network_is_just_an_mlp/) ([twitter](https://twitter.com/bozavlado/status/1787376558484709691)):

It doesn't surprise that you can rewrite one universal approximator as another - but following this very simple publication, many are defending KANs as more interpretable... which is also [being rightfully challenged](https://x.com/FreeFooooooood/status/1787403148442718696).

Have we seen the full rise and fall of a new theory paper in a single week? Is this the preprint system working?

# AI Twitter Recap

> all recaps done by Claude 3 Opus, best of 4 runs. We are working on clustering and flow engineering with Haiku.

**OpenAI and GPT Models**

- **Potential GPT-5 Release**: [@bindureddy](https://twitter.com/bindureddy/status/1787844680182555052) noted that the gpt-2 chatbots are back on chat.lmsys and may be the latest GPT-5 versions, though they seem underwhelming compared to the hype. [@nptacek](https://twitter.com/nptacek/status/1787798590741458976) tested the im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot model, finding it very strong and **definitely better than the latest GPT-4**, while the im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot had fast output but tended to fall into repetitive loops.
- **OpenAI Safety Testing**: [@zacharynado](https://twitter.com/zacharynado/status/1787864594553184427) speculated that OpenAI's "safety testing" for GPT-4.5 couldn't finish in time for a Google I/O launch like they did with GPT-4.
- **Detecting AI-Generated Images**: OpenAI adopted the C2PA metadata standard for certifying the origin of AI-generated images and videos, which is integrated into products like DALL-E 3. [@rohanpaul_ai](https://twitter.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1787853748682805631) noted the classifier can identify **~98% of DALL-E 3 images while incorrectly flagging <0.5% of non-AI images**, but has lower performance distinguishing DALL-E 3 from other AI-generated images.

**Microsoft AI Developments**

- **In-House LLM Training**: According to [@bindureddy](https://twitter.com/bindureddy/status/1787498838024139185), Microsoft is training its own 500B parameter model called MAI-1, which may be previewed at the Build conference. As the model becomes available, it will be natural for Microsoft to push it instead of OpenAI's GPT line, making the two companies more competitive.
- **Copilot Workspace Impressions**: [@svpino](https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1787893785814249780) had very positive first impressions of Copilot Workspace, noting its refined approach and tight integration with GitHub for **generating code directly in repositories, solving issues, and testing**. The tool is positioned as an aid to developers rather than a replacement.
- **Microsoft's AI Focus**: [@mustafasuleyman](https://twitter.com/mustafasuleyman/status/1787580620694077639), having joined Microsoft, shared that the company is AI-first and driving massive technological transformation, with **responsible AI as a cornerstone**. Teams are working to define new norms and build products for positive impact.

**Other LLM Developments**

- **Anthropic's Approach**: In an interview discussed by [@labenz](https://twitter.com/labenz/status/1787580822192574845), Anthropic's CTO explained their approach of giving the AI many examples rather than fine-tuning for every task, as fine-tuning fundamentally narrows what the system can do.
- **DeepSeek-V2 Release**: [@deepseek_ai](https://twitter.com/deepseek_ai/status/1787478986731429933) announced the release of DeepSeek-V2, an open-source 236B parameter MoE model that **places top 3 in AlignBench, surpassing GPT-4**, and ranks highly in MT-Bench, rivaling LLaMA3-70B. It specializes in math, code, and reasoning with a 128K context window.
- **Llama-3 Developments**: [@abacaj](https://twitter.com/abacaj/status/1787527652628140321) suggested Llama-3 with multimodal capabilities and long context could put pressure on OpenAI. [@bindureddy](https://twitter.com/bindureddy/status/1787641041304363061) noted Llama-3 on Groq allows efficiently making multiple serial calls for LLM apps to make multiple decisions before giving the right answer, which is difficult with GPT-4.

**AI Benchmarks and Evaluations**

- **LLMs as a Commodity**: [@bindureddy](https://twitter.com/bindureddy/status/1787507453023994251) argued that LLMs have become a commodity, and even if GPT-5 is fantastic, other major labs and companies will catch up within months as language abilities plateau. He advises using **LLM-agnostic services for the best performance and efficiency**.
- **Evaluating LLM Outputs**: [@aleks_madry](https://twitter.com/aleks_madry/status/1787564287986389277) introduced ContextCite, a method for attributing LLM responses back to the given context to see how the model is using the information and if it's misinterpreting anything or hallucinating. It can be applied to any LLM at the cost of a few extra inference calls.
- **Emergent Abilities of LLMs**: [@raphaelmilliere](https://twitter.com/raphaelmilliere/status/1787845213224067499) shared a preprint exploring philosophical questions around LLMs, covering topics like **emergent abilities, consciousness, and the status of LLMs as cognitive models**. The paper dedicates a large portion to recent interpretability research and causal intervention methods.

**Scaling Laws and Architectures** 

- **Scaling Laws for MoEs**: [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1787625359199911999) noted that DeepSeek-V2-236B took 1.4M H800-hours to train compared to Llama-3-8B's 1.3M H100-hours, validating the Scaling Laws for Fine-Grained MoEs paper. DeepSeek openly shares inference unit economics in contrast to some Western frontier companies.
- **Benefits of MoE Models**: [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1787647666286916053) highlighted DeepSeek's architectural innovations in **attention mechanisms (Multi-head Latent Attention for efficient inference) and sparse layers (DeepSeekMoE for training strong models economically)**, contrasting with the "scale is all you need" mindset of some other labs.
- **Mixture-of-Experts Efficiency**: [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1787828124475928748) pointed out that at 1M context, a ~250B parameter MLA model like DeepSeek-V2 uses only 34.6GB for cache, suggesting that saving long-context examples as an alternative to fine-tuning is becoming more feasible.

They provided [experimental results](https://wandb.ai/nickcdryan/bench/reports/train_loss-24-05-07-01-06-58---Vmlldzo3ODM5Njcx) and are asking for related research on this phenomenon.

- **Investigating Weight Dynamics**: Another member shared a related paper on gating the residual path [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04887](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04887), although it differs from the experiment in not restricting the identity component to positive values.

- **Code and Clarifications**: Further clarification was sought on what was meant by "identity component" in the experiments. The member [shared code](https://gist.github.com/nickcdryan/08c059ec3deb3ef2aca881bdc4409631) that reveals the use of a single weight on the residual connection in a transformer layer.

- **Dataset and Model Details Revealed**: The models used in the experiments have 607M parameters and were trained on the [fineweb dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb) with a batch size of 24 and a learning rate of 6e-4 on a context window of 768, all run on a single A100.

- **Discussion on Training Speed and Odd Loss Curves**: A member discussing the experiment noted that the loss curve seemed odd and was going down too slowly, while another suggested trying the experiment on the OpenWebText dataset to compare results.
