<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 4/24/2024-4/26/2024. We checked 7 subreddits and [**373** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **27** Discords (**395** channels, and **5502** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **599 minutes**.

[Apple's AI emergence](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-mm1-apples-first-large-multimodal-model/) continues apace ahead of WWDC. We've covered [OLMo](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-ai2-releases-olmo-the-4th-open-everything/) before, and it looks like OpenELM is Apple's first [actually open LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14619) ([weights](https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM), [code](https://github.com/apple/corenet)) release sharing some novel research in the efficient architecture direction.

It's not *totally* open, but it's pretty open. As [Sebastian Raschka put it](https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1783480053847736713/photo/1):

> Let's start with the most interesting tidbits:
>
> - OpenELM comes in 4 relatively small and convenient sizes: 270M, 450M, 1.1B, and 3B
> - OpenELM performs slightly better than OLMo even though it's trained on 2x fewer tokens
> - The main architecture tweak is a layer-wise scaling strategy

But:

> "Sharing details is not the same as explaining them, which is what research papers were aimed to do when I was a graduate student. For instance, they sampled a relatively small subset of 1.8T tokens from various publicly available datasets (RefinedWeb, RedPajama, The PILE, and Dolma). This subset was 2x smaller than Dolma, which was used for training OLMo. What was the rationale for this subsampling, and what were the criteria?"

The layer-wise scaling comes from [DeLight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00623), a 2021 paper deepening the standard attention mechanism 2.5-5x in number of layers but matching 2-3x larger models by parameter count. These seem paradoxical but the authors described the main trick of varying the depth between the input and the output, rather than uniform:

- **Understanding RoPE and Extrapolation**: RoPE scaling's effectiveness was debated, with one member sharing that changing the RoPE base during fine-tuning, not pretraining, enhances a model's ability to handle longer contexts as per a [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05209). However, it was clarified that **Llama 3** was pretrained with a 500k RoPE base, without changing the base, in an attempt to decrease RoPE decay factor for longer contexts.

- **Extrapolation Tokens Outweigh Pretraining**: The community discussed the relationship between the number of pretraining tokens and the model's ability to extrapolate, concluding that extensive pretraining is necessary before any further pretraining with higher RoPE bases to prevent loss of extrapolation capabilities.

- **PoSE as an Alternative**: A member referenced Positional Skip-wisE (PoSE) as a novel training method that simulates long inputs using a fixed context window, which could potentially address limitations of relative positional encodings. The method smartly chunks the original context window for efficient extension, as described in the [associated paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3Z1gxuAQrA).

- **Linear Scaling of RoPE Base Debated**: One member solicited insights on how to scale RoPE base with context length, with a community expert noting that setting the base to an arbitrarily high number and then doing empirical testing is common, rather than any systematic linear scaling.

- **Endorsement for Better Positional Encodings**: The conversation highlighted RoPE as potentially inadequate for long context generalization and proposed alternatives like YaRN or LongRoPE, specifically mentioning that LongRoPE is utilized in the **phi-3-128k** model.

- **Revolutionizing Visual Representation Learning**: A novel weakly supervised pre-training method for vision models was highlighted, which categorizes pre-training on image-text data as a classification task. This approach has achieved a training speed that is **2.7 times faster** than traditional contrastive learning, without compromising the quality of representations, as detailed in this [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15653).

- **Simple Yet Effective**: Building on the previous point, the method's success was attributed to detecting concepts from alt-text and training a multilabel classifier. It was noted that this led to the model performing comparably to **CLIP** in zero-shot scenarios and with greatly improved training efficiency.

- **The Cost of Contrast**: In a conversation about the efficacy of text encoders and contrastive learning, it was pointed out that contrastive learning, especially while aligning text encoders, is costly. The approach can incur extra computational expenses when dealing with noisy alt text.

- **Fast Yet Still Lengthy**: A humorous comment was shared acknowledging that while a 2.7x speed increase in training was significant, the overall process remains time-intensive. This reflects a realistic perspective on the improvements in speed.

- **Exploring VAST Possibilities**: Interest was expressed in finetuning **VAST**, a Vision-Audio-Subtitle-Text Omni-Modality Foundation Model and Dataset, with a link provided to the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/txh-mercury/vast).

- **Safe from Harm**: An inquiry about potential irreversible damage to a PC caused by incorrect manual memory management in a custom type with Mojo was addressed with an assurance that the **Operating System** will clean up memory after a process exits, and **Mojo doesn't require manual memory management**.
  
- **Mojo Function Fundamentals**: A Python-to-Mojo conversion discussion revealed two function types, `def` and `fn`, as viable options. The conversation included **code examples and explanations** about the two different function definitions and how to declare variables in Mojo. [Function declarations are described here.](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/functions)

- **Learning Curve for Newcomers**: In a discussion about understanding Mojo's nuances, community members were advised to focus on making their code work first, as it is normal to experience changes in a nascent programming language. The evolution of languages and potential requirement for future refactorings were highlighted as part of the learning process.

- **List Diversity in Mojo Query**: A question regarding **Mojo's ability to handle lists** with mixed data types was fielded, revealing that while possible, the current method is considered "hacky". Illustrative examples were given showing lists containing both integers and strings using `Variant` [as seen in these Gists for Ints and Floats](https://gist.github.com/modularbot/c67e0a66a97aa32314d248f4721f75e2) and for [Ints and StringLiterals](https://gist.github.com/modularbot/1a5beaf165761b55e2f743b3151210eb).

- **Embrace the Mojo Journey**: A newcomer to programming received a warm welcome from the community and a reminder to initially focus on writing code that works. Emphasizing that **mastery comes with practice**, there was an encouragement to stay adaptable and prepared for the evolving landscape of new programming languages.

- **Confusion Cleared on Overload Resolution**: The overload resolution in programming gives precedence to functions with fewer parameters. Therefore, methods within a trait with lower precedence can be overridden by a type that declares both.
- **Trait Conformance Without Extra Parameters**: It was pointed out that a trait does not need to declare an `__eq__` method with a `none` parameter to conform; this could simplify trait declarations.
- **Potential SIMD Equality Compatibility**: A slight modification may allow SIMD to conform to EqualityComparable without altering the trait’s declaration.
- **A Redundant Parameter's Dilemma**: The downside of the discussed method adjustment is the left-over redundant `none` parameter, though it's typically not used directly in dunder methods.
- **Code Efficiency Boost with `kgen.pack.load`**: A change in the code using `kgen.pack.load` in a printf function resulted in a more efficient update: 14 insertions and 985 deletions.

- **Debating Claude’s Capabilities**: An online discussion explored **Claude’s RLAIF training** as light-handed and well-executed. It is reported that Claude’s behavior shows unexpected structure and a deep understanding, ‘mostly orthogonal’ to Anthropic’s vision, giving off "Jungian individuation" and "Bodhisattva vibes." The thread also speculates on the effects of RLAIF versus the base model’s latent dynamics and discusses the potential for Claude's mode collapse to be rectified ([Claude’s conversation thread](https://x.com/repligate/status/1783426037210026372?s=46&t=xxWoJxAS_7-BBFC2ro84Zw)).

- **RLHF vs. KTO in Commercial Deployments**: In response to a query about the stability of **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**, it’s suggested that its application depends on the context, and that **Knowledge-Targeted Optimization (KTO)** might be better suited for certain applied tasks.

- **Transitioning Training Methods for Improved Results**: A mention of an interview shares an experience where moving from **Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT)** to **Data Programming by Demonstration (DPO)** provided better outcomes, and subsequently moving to **KTO** further improved performance based on user feedback.

- **Complications and Nuance in RLHF**: There’s an assertion that **RLHF** is more nuanced than commonly thought, particularly when considering the variety of data and how it interacts with downstream evaluation metrics.

- **Understanding Grad Norm Spikes**: The channel requested clarity on why spikes in gradient norms during pretraining might be undesirable, but no detailed explanation was provided in the response.
