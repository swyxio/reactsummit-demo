  **Claude 3** from **Anthropic** launches in three sizes: Haiku (small,
  unreleased), Sonnet (medium, default on claude.ai, AWS, and GCP), and Opus
  (large, on Claude Pro). Opus outperforms **GPT-4** on key benchmarks like
  GPQA, impressing benchmark authors. All models support **multimodality** with
  advanced vision capabilities, including converting a 2-hour video into a blog
  post. Claude 3 offers improved alignment, fewer refusals, and extended context
  length up to **1 million tokens** with near-perfect recall. Haiku is noted for
  speed and cost-efficiency, processing dense research papers in under three
  seconds. The models excel at following complex instructions and producing
  structured outputs like JSON. Safety improvements reduce refusal rates, though
  some criticism remains from experts. Claude 3 is trained on synthetic data and
  shows strong domain-specific evaluation results in finance, medicine, and
  philosophy.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 3/2/2024-3/4/2024. We checked [**356** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **22** Discords (**352** channels, and **9688** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **984 minutes**.

[Claude 3 is here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39590666)! Nothing else from the weekend matters in comparison, which is awfully nice for weekday newsletter writers.

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/e5df127c-db27-4d63-b1ca-efffc631fcf4.png?w=960&fit=max) 

**TLDR**: 

- Claude now comes in 3 sizes - the smallest two (Haiku - unreleased, Sonnet - default, on claude.ai, AWS and GCP) are fast  (2x faster than Claude 2) and cheap ([half the cost of GPT4T](https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1764738098389225759?s=20)) and good, and the big one (Opus, on Claude Pro, but slower and more expensive) appears to **beat GPT4 on every benchmark that matters**. Sometimes, like in GPQA, a LOT better, [impressing the GPQA benchmark author](https://x.com/idavidrein/status/1764675668175094169?s=20).
- They're all multimodal, specifically vision and convincingly turned a [2hr Karpathy video into a blogpost](https://x.com/mlpowered/status/1764718705991442622?s=20).
- Better alignment - fewer bad refusals, and improved accuracy on hard questions
- 200k token context, can extend up to 1m tokens, with Gemini 1.5-like perfect recal;
  - Notably, [detected that it was being tested](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1764722513014329620) while doing a routine Needle in Haystack test. [Safetyists up in arms](https://x.com/NPCollapse/status/1764740710731837516?s=20).

Our full notes below:

- Haiku (small, $0.25/mtok - "available soon"), Sonnet (medium, $3/mtok - powers claude.ai, is on Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex), Opus (large $15/mtok - powers Claude Pro)
- **Speed**: Haiku is the fastest and most cost-effective model on the market for its intelligence category. **It can read an information and data dense research paper on arXiv (~10k tokens) with charts and graphs in less than three seconds**. Following launch, we expect to improve performance even further. [Sonnet is 2x faster than Opus and Claude 2/2.1](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1764653835568726215?s=20)
- **Vision**: The Claude 3 models have **sophisticated vision capabilities** on par with other leading models. They can process a wide range of visual formats, including photos, charts, graphs and technical diagrams.
- [Opus can turn a 2hr video into a blogpost](https://x.com/mlpowered/status/1764718705991442622?s=20)
- **Long context and near-perfect recall:** Claude 3 Opus not only achieved near-perfect recall, surpassing 99% accuracy, but in some cases, it even identified the limitations of the evaluation itself by recognizing that the "needle" sentence appeared to be artificially inserted into the original text by a human.
- **Easier to use**: The Claude 3 models are better at following complex, multi-step instructions. They are particularly adept at adhering to brand voice and response guidelines, and developing customer-facing experiences our users can trust. In addition, the Claude 3 models are better at producing popular structured output in formats like JSON—making it simpler to instruct Claude for use cases like natural language classification and sentiment analysis.
- **Safety**
- Lower refusal rate - very good to combat anthropic safetyist image and topical vs gemini issues from feb
- "Opus not only found the needle, it recognized that the inserted needle was so out of place in the haystack that this had to be an artificial test constructed by us to test its attention abilities." [from Anthropic prompt engineer](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1764722513014329620)
- criticized by [MMitchell](https://x.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1764739357112713267?s=20) and [Connor Leahy](https://x.com/NPCollapse/status/1764740710731837516?s=20)
- **Evals**
- [choosing to highlight Finance, Medicine, Philosophy domain evals rather than MMLU/HumanEval is good](https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1764719012678897738)
- [59.5% on GPQA](https://x.com/idavidrein/status/1764675668175094169?s=20) is  much better than generalist PhDs and GPT4 - GPQA author is impressed. [paper]([arxiv.org/abs/2311.12022](https://t.co/hb4u4xXzkw)).
- **GPT4 comparisons**
- beats GPT4 at [coding a discord bot](https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1764746084436607010)
- [fails at simple shirt drying but GPT4 doesnt](https://x.com/abacaj/status/1764698421749756317?s=20)
- **misc commentary**
- [200k context, can extend to 1m tokens](https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1764657732727066914?s=20)
- [Haiku is close to GPT4 in evals, but half the cost of GPT3.5T](https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1764738098389225759?s=20)
- [Trained on synthetic data](https://x.com/Justin_Halford_/status/1764677260555034844?s=20)
- [lower loss on code is normal/unremarkable](https://twitter.com/kipperrii/status/1764673822987538622)

# PART X: AI Twitter

> Compare [Claude 3](https://github.com/smol-ai/SocialPipelines/blob/summary-prod/data_ingestion/scripts/constants/summary_27_anthropic.md) vs [GPT4T](https://github.com/smol-ai/SocialPipelines/blob/summary-prod/data_ingestion/scripts/constants/summary_27_anthropic.md)


**AI Progress and Capabilities**

- Sam Altman said that "[all of this has happened before, all of this will happen again](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1764178151889084558)" and "[the hurricane turns faster and faster but it stays perfectly calm in the eye](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1764179620486930941)", possibly alluding to the rapid progress in AI.
- Gemini 1.5 Pro from Google is impressive, with "[objectively sharper optics and higher contrast images than the Apple Vision Pro](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1764005546456199345)" according to Yann LeCun. However, John Carmack [points out](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1764016979101286756) there are many variables that make this comparison not definitive.
- François Chollet [believes](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1763629637689893228) his 2023 views on LLM capabilities were overestimating their potential and usefulness. He outlines [four levels of generalization](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1763692655408779455) LLMs can achieve, with general intelligence being the ability to synthesize new programs to solve never-seen-before tasks.
- [Gemma](https://twitter.com/AravSrinivas/status/1764063557841469758) from Google is able to be deployed zero-shot in the wild in San Francisco for real-world tasks, without any reinforcement learning, just from next-token prediction on simulation and YouTube data.

**AI Investments and Business**

- Softbank sold all its Nvidia shares in 2019 for $3.6B, which would be worth [$93B today](https://twitter.com/nearcyan/status/1763692669698748478). Investing in AI was one of the primary goals of Softbank's Vision Fund.
- Nvidia's early years involved [relentlessly improving](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1763949929611796919) despite competitors having advantages. Their differentiator was taking software more seriously, building the CUDA ecosystem.
- Google faces a problem with the likes of [OpenAI and Perplexity](https://twitter.com/AravSrinivas/status/1763666653748105404) showing that many "search" tasks are better served through conversational AI, similar to how Google disrupted with PageRank and links 25 years ago.
- [Compute and data are the currency of the future](https://twitter.com/alexandr_wang/status/1764071674767720823) according to Alexandr Wang.

**AI Safety and Regulation**

- Elon Musk's lawsuit revealed an investor remark after meeting with Demis Hassabis that "[the best thing he could have done for the human race was shoot Mr. Hassabis then and there](https://twitter.com/AISafetyMemes/status/1763793546535223468)".
- India is [regulating the ability to spin up AI models](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1764422501243703684), which some see as self-sabotage at a critical moment, similar to China kicking out its tech giants.
- Vinod Khosla called for banning open-source AI platforms, which Yann LeCun [believes](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1764083890119942533) would cause us to lose the "war" he thinks we are in.

**Memes and Humor**

- "[Thank god I didn't go into computer science](https://twitter.com/Nexuist/status/1763651659886969329)" says the junior analyst in New York staring at Excel. "Thank god I didn't go into finance" says the ML scientist in San Francisco, also staring at a spreadsheet.
- Geoff Hinton being spotted working on Gemini at Google leads to speculation he's preparing to [take back the CEO role from Sundar Pichai](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1764100109325791561) to save the company he built.
- "[Trump's internal LLM seems to have suffered excessive pruning. How many parameters does he have left? How short is his context window now?](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1764133615590346994)"

**Other Relevant Tweets for AI Engineers**

- "[You know you've got your new system's core abstractions right when things you didn't explicitly design for that used to be complex become incredibly simple](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1764005795799400796)"

- **Mamba vs Transformers on Learning Parity**: `@dashiell_s` reported that a two-layer Mamba model can learn parity for sequences up to length 128, but doesn't generalize well to longer sequences. Their tests showed Mamba performed much better than a similarly configured transformer, which struggled with sequences longer than 64.
  
- **Skeptical of Associative Architecture's Efficiency**: `@norabelrose` expressed skepticism that architectures based on associative recurrence relations can efficiently learn PARITY, suggesting a need for experimentation to compare LSTM and Mamba performance.

- **Possible Misunderstanding of Sensitivity in ML Literature**: `@stellaathena` pointed out that a paper discussing "sensitivity" actually refers to average sensitivity rather than maximum sensitivity, which could imply different theoretical implications.

- **Trained Mamba on PARITY**: `@dashiell_s` shared that they conducted an experiment with Mamba on the PARITY problem, with results and code available on GitHub ([train_mamba.py](https://github.com/dashstander/automatic-circuits/blob/main/train_mamba.py)).

- **Multi-Machine Parallelism Challenges**: `@hailey_schoelkopf` clarified that `lm-eval-harness` does not support multi-machine parallelism, which was causing issues for `@synthetic_johnny`. A workaround was suggested by `@rand0mm` who shared [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html), which can help orchestrate the execution of `lm-eval-harness` across various nodes.

- **Handling Large Models on Single Nodes**: `@synthetic_johnny` was advised by `@hailey_schoelkopf` on evaluating large language models like GPT-J-6B by using `model_args parallelize=True` and `dtype=bfloat16` to spread the model across multiple GPUs in one node, and to start with a batch size of 1 to avoid out-of-memory errors. Discussion touched on the importance of model-parallel over data-parallel configurations when using AzureML.

- **Confusion over LAMBADA Training Data Usage**: `@smerkyg` posed a query regarding the proper use of the LAMBADA dataset for training LLMs. `@hailey_schoelkopf` clarified that it's better not to finetune on the LAMBADA training set as the benchmark is now intended to evaluate general-purpose language modeling abilities.

- **Seeking Example for Multi-GPU HELLASWAG on PYTHON**: `@antonvls` inquired about examples or success stories for running HELLASWAG evaluation on multiple GPUs using Python. `@stellaathena` directed them to the library's automated multi-GPU handling and provided a [GitHub link](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness?tab=readme-ov-file#multi-gpu-evaluation-with-hugging-face-accelerate) for further guidance.

This led to a discussion about the sources of training data, with `@tay2win` hoping that emails and chat logs are not used for training AIs.
- **Misunderstandings of Model Overfitting Addressed**: `@aswarp` clarified the concept of "regurgitating" data by AI models when `@tay2win` suggested overfitting could be the cause. `@aswarp` indicated the issue is known and occurs when models repeat bits of the training data.
- **Confusion Over Using Grok with LM Studio**: In a conversation about integrating Grok with LM Studio, `@pandora_box_open` provided a link to Groq.com, but clarifications on what was intended led to mixed responses and corrections from `@wildcat_aurora` and `@jedd1`.

- **16GB VRAM and Debating Mac Pros**: `@ethanboyle` noted the upper end of VRAM in consumer video cards seems to be 16GB. Following up on suggestions for MacBook Pros with Apple Silicon, concerns about non-upgradability of RAM and installing Linux on Macs were discussed, including potential issues highlighted at [Debian on Apple M1](https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Apple/M1) and [Debian ARM port](https://www.debian.org/ports/arm/).
- **Apple's Unified Memory Architecture in the Hot Seat**: Users debated the upgradability and performance aspects of Apple's M-series chips with unified memory (`@heyitsyorkie`, `@nink1`, `@wyrath`). The architecture, which lacks user-upgradable memory, was contrasted against potential future AMD APUs and CAMM memory modules.
- **Potential Challenges Running LM Studio on Integrated GPUs**: `@ayyouboss` faced issues running LLMs on an integrated VEGA GPU in a Ryzen rig with 16GB of RAM, despite LM Studio running on the CPU. `@rewire` suggested a VRAM limitation might be at play, and after back-and-forth troubleshooting, they proposed trying out Windows instead of Linux due to probable driver issues.
- **Evaluating Silicon Macs for Linux and AI Use**: `@ethanboyle` and others discussed the use of Macs with Apple silicon for AI work, bearing in mind the challenges of Linux installation and non-upgradable unified memory. Some community knowledge and external links such as [Tart virtualization for Apple Silicon](https://tart.run) were shared, which `@wolfspyre` reported as a powerful and free tool for running Linux in containers on Mac.
- **A Costly Affair with Groq Chips**: In a hardware performance and cost comparison, `@nink1` and `@wyrath` discussed how the Groq chip architecture necessitates clustering many chips for high performance, resulting in a significant cost gap compared to Nvidia solutions. An investment in a Groq cluster to run large models could potentially reach millions of dollars.
