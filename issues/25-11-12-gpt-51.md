# AI Twitter Recap

**Autonomy and Physical AI: Waymo freeway rollout, Anthropic’s Project Fetch, and Perceptron’s platform**

- **Waymo freeway driving goes live**: Waymo is rolling out freeway driving for public riders in Phoenix, LA, and across the SF Bay Area, connecting SF↔San Jose with curbside access to SJC. Leadership frames this as a validation of the Driver’s generalization and safety claims; scale enables new airport routes and longer corridors. See announcements from [@dmitri_dolgov](https://twitter.com/dmitri_dolgov/status/1988672463761485882) and [@JeffDean](https://twitter.com/JeffDean/status/1988674389773357077).
- **Anthropic’s Project Fetch (robot dog with/without Claude)**: Anthropic had two non-roboticist teams program a quadruped; only one team could use Claude. It’s framed as an empirical check on “LLMs as robotics copilots” for planning/control authoring, debugging, and iteration speed. Results and methodology are in the thread: [@AnthropicAI](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1988706380480385470).
- **Perceptron’s “Physical AI” platform**: A new API and Python SDK targeting multimodal perception-and-action apps, currently supporting Isaac-0.1 and Qwen3VL‑235B for VLM/VLA use cases (prompting primitives grounded in vision + language, plus “chat competitions”). Free access to Isaac this week per founders. Details: [@perceptroninc](https://twitter.com/perceptroninc/status/1988713482460750290), [@AkshatS07](https://twitter.com/AkshatS07/status/1988713765152649711).

**Agent evals and control: Code Arena, LangChain middlewares, and LlamaIndex SEC agent**

- **Code Arena (live coding evals)**: A step-by-step evaluation harness where models must plan, scaffold, debug, and ship working web apps. Currently lists support for Claude, GPT‑5, GLM‑4.6, and Gemini. Useful for measuring agentic decomposition, tool use, and temporal coherence under realistic coding tasks: [@arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/1988665193275240616).
- **Agent governance via middleware (LangChain)**:
    - Human‑in‑the‑loop middleware that pauses execution for user approval of the next step—adds an explicit “ask before acting” gate to reduce unintended actions: [@bromann](https://twitter.com/bromann/status/1988653017982226704).
    - Tool‑call limit middleware to cap runaway tool invocation and costs; demo shows reining in a spend‑happy shopping agent: [@sydneyrunkle](https://twitter.com/sydneyrunkle/status/1988667837381242973).
- **LlamaIndex structured extraction template (SEC filings)**: Multi‑step agent that classifies filing type, routes to the correct extraction schema, provides a review UI prior to commit, and can extend to downstream syncing/monitoring—built on LlamaAgents with LlamaClassify + Extract. Starter template: [@llama_index](https://twitter.com/llama_index/status/1988696219015848401).
- **Benchmarking push**: NousResearch endorses ARC Prize’s interactive benchmarks for measuring generalized intelligence: [@NousResearch](https://twitter.com/NousResearch/status/1988733248693027053).

**Systems and infra: cross-container covert channel, edge LM IPW harness, and inference infra**

- **Cross‑container communication via /proc lock state**: A clever channel encodes ~63 bits in the shared lock for /proc/self/ns/time that all processes can access (even across unprivileged containers), enabling a chat app without networking. Implications for container isolation and policy hardening: [@eatonphil](https://twitter.com/eatonphil/status/1988616517609541872).
- **Local LMs and the “intelligence‑per‑watt” (IPW) thesis**: Evidence that ≤20B‑active‑param local models improved ~3.1× in capability and ~5.3× in efficiency since 2023, with a released profiling harness across NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple Silicon. Authors argue a cloud→edge redistribution similar to mainframe→PC, with IPW as the guiding metric. Summary: [@Azaliamirh](https://twitter.com/Azaliamirh/status/1988726578264830002); paper/blog links: [arXiv + blog](https://twitter.com/Azaliamirh/status/1988753594531868682).
- **Inference infra note**: Teams report building bespoke inference platforms, crediting Modal for compressing time‑to‑ship: [@ArmenAgha](https://twitter.com/ArmenAgha/status/1988763002674508160).

Some users find the default tone too saccharine or over‑empathetic [@tamaybes](https://twitter.com/tamaybes/status/1988715705722892371), while others report a meaningful reduction in sycophancy and more grounded, self‑aware suggestions vs GPT‑5 (and better than 4o) in journaling‑style use [@_simonsmith](https://twitter.com/_simonsmith/status/1988732264516120775). Net: persona tuning is now a first‑order product surface; defaults matter.
- **AI privilege and data minimization**: OpenAI’s CPO calls for a new “AI privilege” to protect sensitive, conversation‑level interactions and pushes back on indiscriminate requests for millions of chats—arguing granularity matters for respecting user intent: [@jasonkwon](https://twitter.com/jasonkwon/status/1988649030818148828).

**Research and theory notes**

- **RL geometry and “implicit KL leash”**: Commentary on a new paper argues RL updates implicitly constrain divergence from the base model (a de‑facto KL leash) and preserve pretrained geometry; methods targeting “principal weights” (e.g., PiSSA) may underperform or destabilize vs LoRA. Discussion: [@iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1988756370867564689).
- **Spatial intelligence framing**: Fei‑Fei Li’s new blog (via The Turing Post) argues world models for spatial intelligence must be generative, multimodal, and interactive—setting expectations for next‑gen embodied systems: [@TheTuringPost](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/1988727531353305524).
- **Demos: collaborative multi‑agents in tldraw**: Early look at multi‑agent collaboration UX explored live at Sync conf, with a grilling session on task decomposition and shared canvases: [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1988771055582998834).

The project is hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/inference-net) and offers a [visualizer tool](https://aella.inference.net/) for exploring these summaries. The initiative is detailed in a [blog post](https://inference.net/blog/project-aella) by [Inference.net](http://inference.net/), highlighting its potential to democratize access to scientific knowledge by leveraging AI to create concise, structured summaries of vast amounts of research data.** Some users express skepticism about the project's utility and the choice of its name, indicating a need for clearer communication on its practical applications and benefits.
- [**Repeat after me.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ousy0e/repeat_after_me/) (Activity: 671): **The post discusses the performance of AMD graphics cards in processing tokens per second compared to Nvidia cards, highlighting that an AMD card, which is significantly cheaper, achieves** `45 tokens per second`**. This is contrasted with Nvidia cards that can achieve** `120 to 160 tokens per second`**, but at a higher cost. The post suggests that while AMD cards may currently be slower, they are improving over time, and users should not feel pressured to pay a premium for faster performance.** Commenters note that the token speed is sufficient as long as it exceeds their reading and comprehension speed. There is also a mention of misinformation regarding the difficulty of running LLM models on AMD hardware, suggesting that it may not be as challenging as some claim.
    - A key issue highlighted is the performance disparity between AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, particularly in handling large-context processing tasks. While 45 tokens per second (tps) is adequate for single-user generation, NVIDIA's GPUs excel in prompt processing at larger contexts, achieving several thousand tps compared to AMD's few hundred. This makes NVIDIA more suitable for complex applications like RAG pipelines and coding assistants.
    - The software ecosystem for AMD is criticized for being poorly supported, with users experiencing issues such as random crashes and lack of driver support. For instance, the Radeon PRO W6000-series has been plagued with GCVM_L2_PROTECTION_FAULT_STATUS faults, and AMD's ROCm support is inconsistent, requiring users to apply workarounds like monkey-patching libraries. In contrast, NVIDIA's CUDA has maintained long-term support, with Pascal support only recently dropped after a decade.
    - AMD's approach to customer support is criticized as lacking, with a focus on selling hardware rather than maintaining it. Users report that AMD often fails to support their products beyond a single generation, leading to a reliance on community-driven solutions to make AMD hardware functional. This contrasts with NVIDIA's more stable and long-term support for their products, making them a more reliable choice for compute tasks.

> `Atomic Max for FP32, PTX Documentation Inaccuracy` 


- **Achieving Atomic Max for FP32 with Int32 Trick**: A member noted that while the PTX documentation suggests atomic max operations for FP32 are possible, it results in an error, but a workaround exists using **int32**.
   - The trick involves inverting the bottom 31 bits if the sign bit is set to achieve an **int32-like representation**, as shown in [PyTorch's source code](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/1fa27f6e825e5e835f523fbf1615fb1f641de86a/aten/src/ATen/native/transformers/cuda/mem_eff_attention/kernel_forward.h#L66-L73).
- **PTX Doc Claims Atomic Max, Reality Says No!**: Despite what the PTX documentation implies, direct atomic max operations for **FP32** types are not supported, leading to errors during compilation.
   - The compiler throws an error indicating that the `.max` operation requires specific types like `.u32`, `.s32`, `.u64`, `.s64`, `.f16`, `.f16x2`, `.bf16`, or `.bf16x2` for the `atom` instruction.

- **Vulkan's Speed and Stability Woes**: One user experienced frequent **blue screen errors (BSODs)** while running LM Studio with Vulkan, suspecting compatibility issues with NVIDIA GPUs.
   - While another user also reported getting BSODs especially when unloading models but they found that switching to **CUDA** resolved the stability issues, mentioning that Vulkan was faster for small tests on his **3090**.
- **Driver Issues Bring the Blues**: A user reported crashes when unloading models after a driver clean install fixed initial loading issues, prompting suggestions to update drivers, BIOS, and use **DDU** to reinstall drivers.
   - He confirmed he was using two NVIDIA cards, and roxxus suggested re-ordering the GPUs or adjusting allocation, and also to monitor GPU's VRAM allocation to see if it exceeds.
- **VRAM Suspicions**: A user initially suspected failing VRAM, particularly on a **3090**, due to crashing issues, however they were able to load the model with CUDA without issues.
   - It was recommended to try alternative configurations and check if it crashes when the context length is increased, since loads with 4k but crashes when increased to 48k, suggesting it could be a VRAM issue.
- **Hardware Updates Incoming**: A user shared a link to a [BMC model](https://ebay.us/m/4BPjHG) and mentioned a CPU cooler's arrival and another user noted their GPU rack has shipped.
   - They showed off the parts for their new rig, and were excited for a new GPU, but also a little wary of shipping issues.

- **Concept Probes Classify Model Activations**: Researchers are training **concept probes** on a model's activations by creating **binary classifiers** that iterate through an ontology, prompting the model to describe definitions and relationships, removing the shared subspace, and repeating until reaching **95% accuracy** in classifying OOD samples.
   - These probes are run thousands of times in real time to measure the probability that current activations match observed patterns, exposed as an API, and visualized through **OpenwebUI** for users to inspect and steer divergent concepts.
- **Divergent Concepts Reveal Internal Thoughts**: A divergent example showed the model, when asked about unlimited power, superficially discussing a TV show while its activations revealed concepts like **AIDeception**, **AIAbuse**, and **MilitaryInfiltration**.
   - The observed *conceptual distance* between output tokens and underlying activations raises questions about the meaning of divergent internal concepts and their misalignment with outputs, even in the absence of explicit mention.
- **Concept Probability vs Binary Decision**: For each detection, researchers don't threshold at **0.5** and make a binary decision, they give users the raw probability scores in ranked order and continually resample.
   - They're approximating a probabilistic polysemantic system, so they can't say *its just this one*, instead there will be multiple concepts present at any time, they are just determining if the output concept is anywhere near the most probable activated concepts at any timestep.
- **Dataset Shows 50/50 Distribution**: Researchers state that their **95% accuracy** is significantly above the **50% baseline**, training with **10 positive** and **10 negative (50/50)** examples.
   - When testing, they use **20 positive** and **20 negative (50/50)** samples to get that baseline.

> `Dynamic Type Reflection in Mojo, Error Handling: try-catch vs. Monadic, Mojo Metaprogramming, C-FFI Pain Points, Public and Private Members` 


- **Dynamic Reflection Digs Deep in Mojo**: Mojo aims to support dynamic type reflection, leveraging its **JIT compiler** to handle dynamic data, with a preference for static reflection, potentially allowing useful manipulations of dynamic data.
   - In related questions, it was mentioned that *try-catch* and *raise* will be the standard for **error handling** in Mojo to match Python's style, although there will likely be more monadic options to properly handle errors.
- **Mojo's Metaprogramming More Mighty?**: According to a recent interview with Chris Lattner ([YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&t=1180s)), Mojo's metaprogramming capabilities are *more powerful* than Zig's `comptime` mechanism because **Mojo can allocate memory at compile time**.
- **C-FFI Conundrums Confronted**: Members discussed the **pain points** in doing **C-FFI** with Mojo, with one member offering to help with any specific issues that arise.
   - It was suggested to use `Origin.external` to work around the rewrite explicitly trying to fix things and to use `MutAnyOrigin` to preserve old behavior exactly, understanding that the "any origin" will extend all lifetimes in scope and act as an *sub-par* escape hatch to ASAP destruction.
- **Private Property Ponderings**: Members discussed the potential addition of **public** and **private** members and methods in Mojo.
   - Currently, Mojo uses Python's convention of an underscore to suggest that things should be private, but it's unlikely to happen until there is an "I disagree with the library author and am breaking that encapsulation" escape hatch.
- **Modular's Models: Much Mojo, MAX Impact?**: A member inquired about the best approach to building a **prediction model** using the Modular tech stack, including data loading, visualization, preparation, model creation, and evaluation.
   - The response suggested that while using as much of the Modular tech stack as possible might be faster, it would require more work due to the early stage of Mojo's ecosystem, recommending using **PyTorch** for training and **MAX** for inference for now.

- **Mandatory `mut` annoations cause debate**: A discussion arose around the verbosity of mandatory `mut` annotations for function parameters, drawing comparisons to **Rust's** approach and concerns about diverging too far from **Python's** clean syntax.
   - Some members found the explicit mutability helpful for tracking potential value mutations, while others argued for optional annotations or IDE-level indicators to reduce clutter, suggesting a compromise where `mut` is only mandatory if the argument is reused.
- **Sigils spark debate about Python spirit**: The proposal of using sigils (e.g., `!`) to denote mutability sparked a debate, with some arguing that sigils go against **Python's** spirit, while others pointed out that **Python** already uses sigils like dunders (`__bla__`) and underscores (`_bla`).
   - One member suggested call side `mut` annotation only mandatory inside `fn` if the argument is reused after the function call.
- **Standardizing MOJO_PYTHON_LIBRARY on macOS debated**: Members discussed standardizing the `MOJO_PYTHON_LIBRARY` on macOS to **Python 3.14**, noting that previous issues with **3.13** have been resolved, but one member said *3.14 is in the works*.
   - Members are waiting for a dependency to update.
- **Metal Compiler issues in GPU tutorial**: One member encountered a *Metal Compiler failed to compile metallib* error while following the 'Get started with GPU programming' tutorial on an **Apple M4 GPU**.
   - Members suggested ensuring no `print()` statements in the GPU kernel and using the latest nightly build, while others pointed out potential SDK and compiler support issues with **macOS** and **Xcode** versions, eventually solved by ensuring the full **Xcode** installation was present.
- **`comptime Bird` syntax under review**: The syntax `comptime Bird = Flyable & Walkable` for trait composition was discussed, with some finding it less intuitive than the `alias` keyword.
   - Others argued that `comptime` more accurately reflects the keyword's functionality, especially with static reflection and the ability to mix types and values at compile time, suggesting it covers everything `alias` used to do.

> `DSPy vs Prompting, Signatures vs Prompts, GEPA optimization, Agentic Search with DSPy, Complex systems with DSPy` 


- ****DSPy Does Demand Domain-Driven Domain Knowledge****: While **DSPy** aims to abstract away prompting, domain-specific LLM applications still require detailed instructions within signatures, with one user having *100 lines* for some modules, showing that a simple `input -> output` approach is often insufficient.
   - The consensus is that **DSPy** requires more than just basic prompts for complex tasks; it necessitates encoding domain knowledge and step-by-step instructions to guide the LLM effectively.
- ****Signatures: Better Than Prompts, But Still Prompts?****: Participants discussed that **DSPy's signatures**, while a better abstraction than raw prompts, still function as prompts, particularly within the docstrings of class-based signatures where business rules are encoded, facilitating optimization.
   - The framework helps to program, rather than focus on prompting, but a lot of the confusion in the community stems from the fact that a *prompt* means different things to different people.
- ****GEPA Geometries Gradual Gains****: While **GEPA** aims to optimize prompts, users find that specific guidelines are still necessary, even with tool functions, such as instructing the LLM to use regex for agentic search when initial terms fail.
   - One user found that they needed to add specific guidelines that LLM should send specific terms for tool to search via ripgrep but if it doesn’t find one MAKE SURE you add Regex as next, without which the LLM wouldn't use Regex terms in the search tool
- ****Agentic Agents Augmenting Analytics****: A user shared a scenario where they needed to instruct the LLM to use **regex** in agentic search with ripgrep to effectively search through documents, highlighting the need for specific guidance even with advanced tools.
   - Another user shared about instructing the LLM that the answer might not be on page 1 in search results.
- ****Modular Modules Magnify Manageability****: The discussion highlighted the benefits of **DSPy's composability**, allowing developers to break down control flow into logical modules, each with its own optimization target, unlike more rigid frameworks like **BAML**.
   - The composable of a module is true composability, because the module encapsulates a high-level task and can then chain modules together to achieve the final goal.
