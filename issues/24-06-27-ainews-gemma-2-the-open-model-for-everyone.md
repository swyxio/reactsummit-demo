<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Knowledge Distillation is all you need to solve the token crisis?**

> AI News for 6/26/2024-6/27/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**416** channels, and **2698** messages) for you.

[Gemma 2 is out!](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/gemma-2-report.pdf) Previewed at I/O ([our report](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-google-io-in-60-seconds/)), it's out now, with the 27B model they talked about, but curiously sans 2B model. Anyway, it's good, of course, for its size - does lower in evals than Phi-3, but better in ratings on LMSys, just behind yi-large (which also [launched at the World's Fair Hackathon on Monday](https://x.com/01AI_Yi/status/1805431304999022812)):

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b7f2a5de-6997-4f87-8529-fa486a002b6d.png?w=960&fit=max) 

We have some small hints as to what the drivers might be:

- 1:1 alternation between local and global attention (similar to [Shazeer et al 2024](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-shazeer-et-al-2024/))
- Logit soft-capping per Gemini 1.5 and Grok
- GQA, Post/pre rmsnorm

But of course, data is the elephant in the room; and here the story has been KD:

> In particular, we focus our efforts on knowledge
distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), which **replaces
the one-hot vector seen at each token with the
distribution of potential next tokens computed
from a large model**. 
>
> This approach is often used
to reduce the training time of smaller models by
giving them richer gradients. In this work, we
instead train for large quantities of tokens with
distillation in order to simulate training beyond
the number of available tokens. Concretely, we
use a large language model as a teacher to train
small models, namely 9B and 2.6B models, on
**a quantity of tokens that is more than 50× the
compute-optimal quantity predicted by the theory (Hoffmann et al., 2022)**. Along with the models trained with distillation, we also release a 27B
model trained from scratch for this work.

At her [World's Fair talk on Gemma 2](https://youtubetranscript.com/?v=JVSKlEmUr0k&t=12381), Gemma researcher Kathleen Kenealy also highlighted the Gemini/Gemma tokenizer:

> "while Gemma is
trained on primarily English data the
Gemini models are multimodal they're
multilingual so this means the Gemma
models are super easily adaptable to
different languages. One of my
favorite projects we saw it was also
highlighted in I/O was a team of
researchers in India fine-tuned Gemma to
achieve state-of-the-art performance on
over 200 variants of indic languages
which had never been achieved before."

Fellow World's Fair speaker Daniel Han also called out the [attention-scaling](https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1806372357684220308) that was only discoverable in the code:

- **Newcomer finds solution for pow implementation**: A new member shared an [issue](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/issues/4190) about adding a pow function in Triton, later finding a workaround with `libdevice.pow(x,x+1)`. They expressed gratitude for the community's help, stating the issue is now closed.

- **Triton lacks native pow but has alternatives**: Members discussed Triton's absence of a pow function, suggesting the use of `exp` and `log` functions to simulate it. "*You can probably get away with it by doing multiplication*" was one suggestion.

- **CUDA pow kernels get compiled to exp and log**: It was highlighted that CUDA pow kernels, when using fast math, compile to a sequence involving `exp` and `log` instructions. The generated code for pow is more complex without fast math, implying a tradeoff between precision and performance.

- **Accuracy considerations for pow in deep learning**: The conversation emphasized that while the exp+log simulation of pow is less accurate, this inaccuracy is generally acceptable in deep learning contexts. "*The exp + log thing is inaccurate but it doesn't really matter for deep learning*" summarizes the sentiment.

- **Verification of Triton's generated PTX code suggested**: To ensure optimal performance, it was recommended to verify that Triton generates the 'fast' version of pow code. The original poster agreed to check, noting Triton currently uses CUDA's slower pow implementation.

- **Static Lifetime Discussion**: The chat included a deep dive into `ImmutableStaticLifetime`, clarifying it pertains to the lifetime of a "static" item, like what's stored in an alias. This allows taking references to `alias` items, similar to `let`.
- **Graph API and Indexing Updates**: Improvements were made to the Graph API, specifically integer literal slices and slicing across all dimensions, with some use restrictions for optimization. `ops.unsqueeze` was suggested as a workaround for certain indexing patterns not yet supported.
- **Call for More Detailed Changelogs**: Members expressed a need for more detailed changelogs, especially relating to API changes like in `max`. Developers acknowledged the oversight and committed to better documentation in future releases.
