<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**LLM evals will soon vary across categories and prompt complexity.**

> AI News for 5/8/2024-5/9/2024. We checked 7 subreddits and [**373** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **28** Discords (**419** channels, and **3747** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **450 minutes**.

LMSys is widely known for ELO-based (technically [Bradley-Terry](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-12-07-leaderboard/)) battles, and more controversially [opaquely prerelease-testing models for OpenAI, Databricks and Mistral](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/chatbotarena-the-future-of-llm-evaluation#%C2%A7gptchatbot-and-lmsyss-incentives), but only recently started to deepen its analysis by splitting out the scores to 8 subcategories of queries:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6f5379a0-2938-4952-9b20-f107416dd59e.png?w=960&fit=max) 

These categories are [about to explode](https://x.com/lmsysorg/status/1788363029387899016) in dimensionality. [LMsys published a deep analysis of Llama-3's performance on LMsys](https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-05-08-llama3/), that broke out its surprisingly uneven win rate across important categories (like summarization, translation, and coding)

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/a9d1f078-8dce-4c6d-8758-981387034b7b.png?w=960&fit=max) 

and for 7 levels of prompt complexity:

As GPT4T-preview-tier models commoditize, and as LMsys increasingly becomes the trusted eval that can be gamed in subtle ways, it is important to understand the major ways in which models can over- or under- perform. It's wonderful that LMsys is proactively doing  so, but also curious that the notebooks for this analysis weren't released per their usual M.O.

- **Cumulative Sum Function Spotlight**: A link to the modular Mojo standard library documentation for the `cumsum` function was provided, specifically highlighting its presence and usage. The function is referenced in the [Mojo documentation](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/algorithm/reduction/cumsum).

- **Naming Conventions and PyConLT Anecdote**: A member mentioned a brief internal struggle they had over the abbreviation `cumsum` while presenting at PyConLT but ultimately chose not to dwell on it.

- **Serious Bug Found in Mojo**: A potentially serious issue was raised in the `Tensor` / `DTypePointer` standard library, detailed in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/2591). A subsequent discussion focused on whether this constitutes a bug or a property of the `UnsafePointer` lacking a lifetime.

- **The Perplexity of Pointers and Lifetimes**: Confusion arose over the behavior of `DTypePointer` when used with `memcpy`; it was pointed out that the tensor is destroyed but its data assignment persists in a non-owning pointer, which leads to a dangling pointer scenario.

- **Mojo's Nightly Compiler Update**: The announcement of a new Mojo compiler release was made, with 31 external contributions merged. Users are encouraged to update with `modular update nightly/mojo` and check out the [diff of this release](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2593/files) and the [changelog for changes since the last stable release](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/nightly/docs/changelog.md).

- **Tensor API Update for Clarity**: The `Tensor.data()` call was renamed to `Tensor.unsafe_ptr()` to better reflect its behavior, a change that was generally appreciated by the members in the discussion.

- **Model Directory Structure Clarified**: Members discussed the proper directory for storing models. The correct setup involves a top-level `\models` folder with subfolders for each publisher and respective repository, akin to Hugging Face's naming convention. For instance, a model file should be in the pathway `\models\lmstudio-community\Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF\Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf`.

- **Connecting Web UI to LM Studio**: It was suggested to use a UI that supports generic OpenAI API specification for integrating with LM Studio. AnythingLLM and [Open WebUI with Docker support](https://docs.openwebui.com/tutorial/openai) were mentioned as viable options for interacting with the LM Studio API.

- **LM Studio's GPU Requirements Explained**: Discussions highlighted the necessity of GPU VRAM, advising to turn GPU acceleration off if encountering errors related to GPU detection. It was also noted that the app is not designed to run on Windows ARM laptops since ARM architecture is unsupported.

- **Challenges with Using LM Studio**: Errors like "unable to allocate backend buffer" imply insufficient memory on a user's PC to run local models. An explanation was given that local models typically require 8GB of VRAM and 16GB of RAM.

- **Local Model Discovery in LM Studio**: For finding all available models within LM Studio, a tip was shared to search for "GGUF" in the model search bar to list all models. This workaround helps uncover different models even if users are unaware of their specific names.

- **Performance Discussion on Normalization Techniques**: A Torch user posed a question regarding performance implications when normalizing tensors in NHWC format, questioning if permuting to NCHW is preferred over NHWC-optimized algorithms. Another user responded highlighting a [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/memory_format_tutorial.html) that suggests channels-last can lead to a 20% performance increase, but conversion might not have a cost due to stride manipulation.

- **Improvements in LibTorch Compile Times**: A discussion on improving compile times led to the discovery that using ATen’s `at::native::randn` instead of `torch::randn` and including `<ATen/ops/randn_native.h>` over `<ATen/ATen.h>` reduced a user's compile time from roughly 35 seconds to 4.33 seconds.

- **libtorch vs. cpp Extensions**: Marksaroufim suggested exploring cpp extensions for integrating C++ with PyTorch, reasoning that not many people work on libtorch today. Furthermore, he mentioned AOT Inductor as a way to generate `.so` files ahead of time, which is detailed in a [torch export tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_export_tutorial.html).

- **Clarification on ATen and libtorch Distinction**: Through the chat, it became clear that ATen is considered a backend while libtorch is regarded as a frontend. The user seeking advice realized they just needed tensor capabilities and not the entire libtorch, leading to significant improvements in their workflow.

- **Query on Model Caching with AOTInductor**: Benjamin_w inquired about caching a compiled model using AOT Inductor to avoid recompilation delays. Marksaroufim offered a potential solution by setting `torch._inductor.config.fx_graph_cache = True` and noted efforts to enhance warm compile times.

- **Clarification Sought on `DivNode` and `ModNode` in tinygrad**: A user questioned if `symbolic.DivNode` intentionally required `self.b` to be an `int` rather than a `Node`, relating to the need for a symbolic version of `arange`. A response indicated that the union type of `Node` or `int` should not prevent a `Node` from being used.
  
- **Discussion on Symbolic `arange` Implementation**: It was suggested that for implementing symbolic `arange`, `Tensor.full` could call `Tensor.from_node` conditionally, and `div` and `sub` operations might be extended in the same pattern as `mul`. Concerns were raised about potential downstream fallout and lack of support for pooling operations.

- **Attempt at Enhancing tinygrad with Symbolic `arange`**: A user shared frustration after attempting to implement symbolic `arange` in tinygrad, referencing their [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/compare/master...davidjanoskyrepo:symbolic-arange-pull) and noting uncertainty in the intended behaviour of `step` in tests, planning to refocus on a 'bitcast refactor'.

- **Inquiring About In-place Output Mechanisms in tinygrad**: One user inquired about the possibility of writing the output of matrix operations directly into a pre-allocated section of an existing matrix to avoid wasteful copies, mentioning a novel design that concatenates the output of `n` matrix operations. George Hotz commented that there are hacks for this regarding disk storage and it would likely be a quick change to implement more broadly.

- **Metal Build Process and `libraryDataContents()` Mystery**: A user struggling with the Metal build process for tinygrad asked about `libraryDataContents()`, referencing a Discord message and outside documentation without finding clear answers. The user questioned whether there was a missing symbol or library necessary to understand the usage.

- **Visualization Tool for Shape and Stride Introduced**: For those working with shape and stride concepts in tinygrad, a user created and shared a [visualization tool](https://mesozoic-egg.github.io/shape-stride-visualizer/) that could assist in understanding different combinations.

- **InterpretedFlopCounters and Flop Counting Explained**: A user's query about the purpose of counting flops in `ops.py` was clarified with the point that flop count serves as a proxy for performance in tinygrad.

- **Seeking Functionality Similar to PyTorch's `register_buffer` in tinygrad**: Querying about a feature analogous to PyTorch's `register_buffer`, a user received guidance to use `Tensor(..., requires_grad=False)` as an equivalent in tinygrad.

- **Launch of Quickscope by Regression Games**: Regression Games has announced the launch of [**Quickscope**](https://play.regression.gg), a suite of AI tools designed to automate testing for Unity games, boasting simple integration and a code-free setup. The toolkit includes a **Gameplay Session recording tool** and a **Validations tool** to automate smoke tests and functional tests with ease.

- **Deep Property Scraping Explained**: Quickscope's functionality includes deep property scraping of game object hierarchies, extracting comprehensive details from game entities without the need for custom code integration. This allows for detailed information to be gathered on positions, rotations, and the public properties and fields of MonoBehaviours.

- **Discover the Quickscope Platform**: Potential users are encouraged to try out Quickscope for their test automation needs, as the platform promotes various automation approaches, including **smart replay and playback systems**, and is designed with **QA teams** in mind. The platform boasts quick and easy integration, with no custom code required, significantly simplifying the test setup process. 

- **Tools Highlight for Efficient Testing**: Quickscope emphasizes its [highly interactive UI](https://regression.gg/) for defining tests, offering QA engineers and game developers a user-friendly approach to game testing. The service can be used directly in the Unity editor, in builds, or integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
