- **A100 underperforms with INT1 loading**: There’s an ongoing issue with loading **INT1** on the **A100 GPUs**, making performance sub-optimal compared to other models like the **3090**. A GitHub [issue](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/issues/4906#issuecomment-2458194810) highlights this inconsistency and seeks insights from the community.
  
  - The confusion around performance metrics has been persistent for weeks, with detailed logs examined for clarity.
- **FP8 Triton Kernel shows speed advantage**: Using an activation quantization kernel along with the **FP8 Triton kernel**, one member reported faster performance than other methods, achieving **45.39 us** compared to **55.23 us** for Torch compiled alternatives. This showcases the efficiency of the Triton approach in matrix multiplication tasks.
  
  - Discussions ensued about potential slowdowns when quantizing activation within the matmul, with experiments revealing mismanagement of matrix dimensions as a performance drawback.
- **Optimizing Kernel Configurations**: There was an exchange about avoiding `autotune` by using pre-defined configurations based on matrix dimensions for Triton kernels to improve warm-up times. Suggestions included creating a dictionary for sizes to streamline kernel calls.
  
  - This method anticipates slight variations needed for different GPU architectures, leading to potentially enhanced performance.
- **Challenges with Triton PTX Launch**: A user expressed difficulty in calling Triton-compiled **PTX** kernels directly using CUDA launch syntax outside of Python, citing uncertainty on the correct launch parameters. They sought clarification on how to derive these parameters.
  
  - Another member suggested using **ncu** to determine the actual block and grid sizes for specific problem sizes, facilitating better alignment with Triton-generated configurations.

> - `PyTorch Tensor Iteration Performance`
> - `Numpy Iteration Speed`
> - `Torch Script Debugging`
> - `Overhead of tolist()`

- **tolist() shines in PyTorch tensor iteration**: Benchmarking showed that using `tolist()` for iterating a PyTorch tensor was significantly faster, taking only **0.0073 seconds** compared to **2.39 seconds** for GPU and **0.64 seconds** for CPU iterated versions.
  
  - One user mentioned that the **CPU tensor iteration** may be slow due to the overhead of dispatching operations on torch tensors.
- **Numpy iteration faster than CPU tensors**: Adding to the conversation, another user benchmarked numpy iteration at **0.0138 seconds**, which was faster than CPU tensor iteration but still slower than list iteration.
  
  - This suggests that while numpy is efficient, the list conversion provides a notable performance advantage.
- **Overhead concerns with tolist()**: It was pointed out that around **30%** of the overhead in CPU tensor iteration derives from the `.tolist()` call, which could matter if performance is critical for repeated iterations.
  
  - Optimizing away this conversion could lead to better performance in scenarios requiring numerous iterations over tensor data.
- **Question on Torch Script Debugging**: A user expressed a need for guidance on debugging Torch Script, specifically mentioning attempts to print each node's output.
  
  - This inquiry suggests a search for better tools or methods within the community for tracing and debugging Torch Script effectively.

> - `KD-div Misinterpretation`
> - `Cross-Entropy Optimization`

- **KD-div's Returned Value Confusion**: It's highlighted that while we refer to it as **KD-div**, the **returned value** is actually **cross-entropy**, which can lead to misinterpretation when comparing with other loss functions like KL-div.
  
  - The potential confusion arises particularly when considering swapping teacher and student logits, a process often referred to as *reverse KL*.
- **Cross-Entropy as a Natural Extension**: A viewpoint shared suggests it feels more intuitive to *optimize for cross-entropy*, interpreting it as an extension of cross-entropy loss from regular labels to soft labels produced by a teacher model.
  
  - This perspective emphasizes the evolution from **hard labels** in training to **soft labels** in fine-tuning as a natural progression.
