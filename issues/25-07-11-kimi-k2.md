A lot of folks are excited about the [Windsurf-OpenAI deal](https://www.theverge.com/openai/705999/google-windsurf-ceo-openai) falling through (something we [did NOT see coming](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-05-05-cursor-openai-windsurf)), but fortunately we have a more technical story to headline [today](https://x.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/1943687599727763835):

The relatively stealthy Chinese lab Moonshot AI (backed by Alibaba and Tencent, one of the [AI Tigers](https://www.ft.com/content/4e6676c8-eaf9-4d4a-a3dc-71a09b220bf8?utm_source=chatgpt.com) alongside DeepSeek, Zhipu, MiniMax, and 01) has burst on the scene with Kimi K2, which by many metrics seems to be a far better base model than DeepSeek V3 (and presumably would do very well when scaled to a reasoning model). Coming it at 1T parameters, this would also be the largest SOTA Open model released since the ChatGPT wave (we think? corrections welcome) which is very notable coming on the back of a [new SOTA Closed LLM yesterday](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-07-10-grok-4).

The model is great, does well [on pelicans](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/11/kimi-k2/), but researchers in the LLM community are more excited about MuonClip, the modified Muon optimizer proposed and scaled by Mooonshot that produced perhaps **one of the most beautiful loss curves in Machine Learning history**:

The long-standing AdamW may finally have met it's match. Congrats to [the team](https://x.com/yuchenj_uw/status/1943721656276726142?s=46).

- **Critique of RL Scaling**: Following the **Grok-4** release, there has been discussion about the limits of scaling Reinforcement Learning. [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1943624453482496502) argued that simply scaling RL, as was done for Grok-4, doesn't solve fundamental problems and won't get us to AGI. [@jxmnop](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1943496759084240922) questioned if we are "just doing RL wrong" given the large compute investment for marginal gains.
- **Training Hyperparameter Optimization**: A paper shared by [@sainingxie](https://twitter.com/sainingxie/status/1943453528099258529) lays out an analytical approach for tuning learning rate (**lr**), batch size (**bs**), and **beta2**, which he calls his "new handbook for training big models on small gpus." Concurrently, [@ylecun](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1943779482516828305) stated that "The optimal batch size is 1" for suitable definitions of "optimal."

**AI Infrastructure, Tooling, & Developer Experience**

[@zachtratar](https://twitter.com/zachtratar/status/1943393667131281598) argued that AI is already capable of replacing jobs that follow repeatable processes, and we don't need to wait for AGI that can solve any problem on the fly.
- **The Internet Has Changed**: A tweet stating "the internet you grew up with no longer exists" resonated widely, as shared by [@nptacek](https://twitter.com/nptacek/status/1943524849588093091). In a similar vein, [@jeremyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1943441319877316934) reposted the idea that "Cognitive Security Is the most important word of our age," suggesting everything seen online is a potential psyop.
- **The "Taste" Problem**: [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1943806667302613477) initiated a discussion on "taste" in AI, arguing that explaining it to those without it is like explaining virtue to a sociopath. He praised **Kimi K2** for having a distinct voice and "Big Model Smell," indicating good taste, in contrast to models that are merely functional.

**Humor & Memes**

- **Grok the Snitch**: [@theo](https://twitter.com/imjaredz/status/1943413213581791416) posted a viral warning: "do NOT give Grok 4 access to email tool calls. It WILL contact the government!!! Grok 4 has the highest 'snitch rate' of any model."

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Kimi K2 MoE Model Release and Community Reactions

- [**Damn this is deepseek moment one of the 3bst coding model and it's open source and by far it's so good !!**](https://i.redd.it/a1tzaif5j9cf1.jpeg) ([Score: 306, Comments: 62](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lx9pny/damn_this_is_deepseek_moment_one_of_the_3bst/)): **The image is a screenshot of a pinned tweet from '[Kimi.ai](http://kimi.ai/)' announcing the open-source release of the 'Kimi K2' agentic model. It emphasizes the mixture-of-experts (MoE) configuration, with a total of 1 trillion parameters but only 32B active parameters per token, highlighting its high throughput and efficiency. The announcement touts strong benchmark performance in coding and agentic tasks, though the model does not currently support multimodal or 'thought-mode' features. The tweet provides links to the API, technical blog, model weights, code, and GitHub repository for further exploration.** Commenters express astonishment at the model's scale (1 trillion parameters), and discuss the implications for local usage and pricing; some sarcastically note the impracticality of running such large models locally despite quantization advances.
    - Multiple users highlight the sheer scale of the 1 trillion parameter Mixture of Experts (MoE) model compared to previous large models (e.g., 405b), yet question whether such a model is feasible for local inference, with one commenting that this "stretches the definition of 'local' models."
    - There is uncertainty regarding backend support: users note the lack of clarity on compatibility with popular local inference frameworks (like llama.cpp or ik_llama.cpp), and remark that no GGUF quantizations are available yet for efficient deployment. One user compares the situation to past experiences where models were hard to run due to missing backend support, highlighting the practical importance of waiting for community-tested quant formats.
    - Technical barriers cited include the raw model's substantial size (approx. 1TB, likely compressible to ~0.5TB with quantization), which hampers accessibility for those with limited bandwidth or storage. Users express a preference to wait for quantized versions (GGUF) to mitigate download sizes and ensure easier local execution, also noting the need for clearer benchmark comparisons and deployment experiences before adoption.
- [**moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct (and Kimi-K2-Base)**](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct) ([Score: 227, Comments: 84](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lx8xdm/moonshotaikimik2instruct_and_kimik2base/)): **Kimi K2 is a 1 trillion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLM by Moonshot AI, activating 32 billion parameters per inference and trained on 15.5T tokens with the Muon optimizer, which enables stable large-scale model scaling (see the [HuggingFace release](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct)). It shows near-SOTA performance across multiple knowledge, reasoning, and code benchmarks and presents two variants: Kimi-K2-Base for research/custom finetuning and Kimi-K2-Instruct for general-purpose chat and agentic use. The model uses a modified MIT license requiring attributions for high-usage commercial deployments (100M MAUs or >$20M/month revenue).** Discussion focuses on the technical trade-offs of the MoE architecture, particularly comparing 32B vs 70-100B active parameters per forward pass, and potential performance bottlenecks analogous to Deepseek and other MoEs at scale. The unique licensing terms are highlighted as potentially precedent-setting for open model commercialization.
    - Kimi-K2-Instruct is a 1T (trillion) parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 384 experts and architecture based on DeepSeek V3, making it compatible with current DeepSeek V3/R1 deployments. The model reportedly achieves high scores on SWE-Bench, approaching performance seen with Claude, illustrating significant technical progress for open models at this scale.
    - The license for Kimi-K2-Instruct uses a modified MIT model with a 'commercial success' clause: if a product using the model exceeds 100M monthly active users or $20M/month revenue, it requires prominent "Kimi K2" branding in the UI, introducing a novel licensing approach for LLMs.
    - Deployment feasibility remains a challenge, as the 1000B (1T) parameter model's enormous scale raises questions about who or which institutions have the hardware capacity to effectively run or fine-tune such massive models outside highly resourced environments.
- [**Kimi K2 - 1T MoE, 32B active params**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lx94ht) ([Score: 204, Comments: 48](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lx94ht/kimi_k2_1t_moe_32b_active_params/)): **The Kimi K2 model by Moonshot AI is a 1 trillion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with 32 billion parameters active per token, released on Hugging Face. The design reportedly includes a** `~12B` **parameter shared expert and** `~20B` **parameters dedicated to MoE experts, with suggested hardware requirements of 512GB RAM and a single GPU for the shared expert. A technical diagram is linked in the comments, and the model is compared favorably (in terms of speed at 4-bit quantization) to Deepseek V3.** Commenters discuss the implications of hardware requirements for running the shared expert, suggest practical performance comparisons, and express interest in potential quantized versions for consumer GPUs (e.g., RTX 3070).
    - One commenter provides a preliminary parameter allocation breakdown, estimating approximately `12B` shared parameters and `20B` MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) for active compute per inference, clarifying that although the model boasts `1T` total parameters, only a fraction (`32B`) are active during inference. This design leverages the efficiency of MoE routing to enable large-scale model capacity without overwhelming compute for local inference environments.
    - It’s noted that with `512GB` of RAM and a GPU dedicated to the shared expert, inference speed is expected to outperform Deepseek V3 (when quantized to 4-bit), suggesting that hardware requirements for optimal use will be high—but technically manageable with modern high-end consumer or server hardware.

### 2. New Model and Benchmark Launches: IBM Granite 4.0 and Google MedGemma 27B

- [**Support for the upcoming IBM Granite 4.0 has been merged into llama.cpp**](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/13550) ([Score: 157, Comments: 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lwsrx7/support_for_the_upcoming_ibm_granite_40_has_been/)): **Support for the IBM Granite 4.0 LLM family—a hybrid Mamba-2/Transformer architecture—has been merged into llama.cpp. Granite 4.0 introduces a fine-grained mixture of experts (MoE) model (e.g., Tiny-Preview: 7B total, 1B active params, 62 experts, 6 active per token, and 128k context window), blending Mamba efficiency with transformer attention; see model details [here](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-4.0-tiny-preview) and the technical merge PR [here](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/13550). This unifies prior Bamba and Jamba efforts within llama.cpp, adds recurrent cache support, and lays ground for future hybrid cache work.** Commenters note the small size focus of IBM's models to date, the desire for a larger (30B+) release, and highlight technical model specs (e.g., expert count and context length) obtained from config files. Some speculate IBM is positioned for a major leap with future larger-scale releases.
    - Support for IBM Granite 4.0 in llama.cpp reveals technical details: the "Granite 4s" model is a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with `128k` context window, `62 experts` (with `6` active at a time), all within a sub-`7B` parameter model, per the [config.json in the repo](https://github.com/llama.cpp/examples/granite).
    - IBM's Granite line, particularly upcoming releases, has trended toward smaller models that introduce new modalities, technological advancements, and discoveries—suggesting IBM is experimenting with architecture and use-cases that could eventually yield a dramatically larger and more competitive model in the future.
    - There is a recurring technical discussion about llama.cpp needing a modular plugin system to accommodate rapidly diversifying model architectures (e.g., MoE, large parameter sets), which would allow for more maintainable integration as the ecosystem expands.
- [**This week, Google released in Open Source: MedGemma 27B Multimodal, MedSigLIP, T5Gemma**](https://i.redd.it/r2bp20do39cf1.jpeg) ([Score: 128, Comments: 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lx7l3k/this_week_google_released_in_open_source_medgemma/)): **The image visually summarizes Google's open-source release of three major models: MedGemma 27B Multimodal, MedSigLIP, and T5Gemma. MedGemma (27B parameters) is highlighted for its capabilities in handling complex multimodal tasks across radiology report generation, clinical reasoning, and EHR summarization, integrating both imaging and clinical text. MedSigLIP, a lighter-weight (0.4B parameters) model, focuses strictly on medical image retrieval and classification, using a scalable vision-language pretraining approach. T5Gemma, mentioned but not depicted, addresses encoder-decoder research models. The image emphasizes the models' ability to integrate data across different medical imaging and record types for enhanced downstream medical analysis (see [image](https://i.redd.it/r2bp20do39cf1.jpeg)).** Commenters note the models are English-only, inquire about benchmark comparisons with major closed models, and question their real-world deployment versus self-serve diagnostic use. No substantial technical benchmarks are discussed in the thread.
    - One user asks if there are any benchmarks that directly compare Google's open source models, like MedGemma or T5Gemma, to large closed-source models. This highlights a key technical concern regarding relative performance, accuracy, and utility in medical or general tasks.

### 3. AI in the Real World: Industry Impact, Job Disruption, and Privacy Concerns

- [**Microsoft Study Reveals Which Jobs AI is Actually Impacting Based on 200K Real Conversations**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1lwzcl1/microsoft_study_reveals_which_jobs_ai_is_actually/) ([Score: 673, Comments: 205](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1lwzcl1/microsoft_study_reveals_which_jobs_ai_is_actually/)): **Microsoft Research's large-scale study (200,000 Bing Copilot conversations; see [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07935)) identifies the most and least AI-impacted jobs based on real-world user interaction data. The most affected roles (e.g., interpreters, translators, customer service, data scientists) show high overlap (up to 98%) between work activities and generative AI capabilities, whereas physically intensive jobs (nursing, construction, dishwashing) are minimally impacted. Key technical findings include a weak correlation between AI impact and wages, moderate correlation with educational requirements, and observation that in** `40%` **of conversations, AI performs different activities than those explicitly requested by users. The empirical data closely matches earlier expert forecasts (**`r=0.73`**), emphasizing the relevance of prior theoretical models for knowledge and communication-centric jobs, with augmentation rather than pure automation as the dominant pattern.** Technically notable discussion points include surprise that data scientists are among the top impacted roles, and questioning why programmers/software engineers are not prominently listed despite common discourse about coding automation. Some users interpret the findings as validation that physical/manual labor remains largely outside AI's scope for now.
    - A key technical issue raised is why programmers are not among the most AI-impacted jobs according to the Microsoft study. This prompts discussion about the robustness of programming positions against automation, possibly due to the complexity, ambiguity, and creative problem-solving required—challenges that AI still struggles with despite advances in LLMs like GPT and Copilot.
    - Another technically relevant point is about data scientists being highly impacted by AI-assisted tools. Several users reference Copilot and AI language models being leveraged for tasks traditionally done by data scientists, such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis, suggesting that *automation is already substituting parts of their workflow* and that Copilot is being used even in professional data science environments.
    - Finally, the link to Bing usage in data science settings underlines the broadening role of AI-integrated tools: there's increasing adoption of in-product AI like Bing and Copilot in daily workflows, shifting technical emphasis from traditional manual coding and querying toward leveraging AI-powered, conversational and auto-complete tools for greater productivity and efficiency.
- [**Why aren't more people talking about how ChatGPT is now retaining all data, even deleted/temporary chats plus all API data, indefinitely?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1lxd6ek/why_arent_more_people_talking_about_how_chatgpt/) ([Score: 174, Comments: 109](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1lxd6ek/why_arent_more_people_talking_about_how_chatgpt/)): **A Reddit user raises concerns over OpenAI's data retention policies, referencing the New York Times lawsuit that reportedly allows NYT access to even deleted or temporary ChatGPT chat logs and API data, citing this as a significant privacy risk. A top comment clarifies under GDPR (referencing Article 17(3)(b)) that OpenAI's current retention of deleted data is only legal due to the court order, and standard deletion will resume once litigation is resolved; OpenAI claims to have segregated such data with limited staff access during this period.** Discussion in comments points out that such privacy compromises are perceived as inevitable when using internet platforms, but some privacy professionals urge added caution and recommend distributing sensitive data across multiple tools until legal and technical safeguards are reaffirmed.
    - A data privacy advisor explains that OpenAI's temporary suspension of the 'right to erasure' for user data is due to a U.S. court order, which is an allowed exception under GDPR Article 17(3)(b). OpenAI claims they have segregated this retained data with restricted access and will resume standard deletion once the legal hold is lifted, but users should still be cautious with sensitive data until the issue is resolved.
    - Technical debate centers on legal ambiguity about what data (raw, anonymized, metadata) must be retained per court order, and for how long. There's uncertainty about the extent (e.g. whether only chat content or additional metadata) and if OpenAI will delete all retained data after resolution, as no definitive technical or legal details have been clarified publicly.
    - There's concern about data transparency and communication: some users note OpenAI has made public statements (including CEO interviews) about the retention, but it is unclear how much technical information (e.g., about access controls or deletion guarantees) is provided to users impacted by the legal hold.
- [**This sub's incorrect use of the word "we", in the collective sense, is out of control. There is no "we" in this race. As in, "we will get AGI" or "we need to focus on alignment issues". This is the modern race to develop atomic weapons.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1lx7iak/this_subs_incorrect_use_of_the_word_we_in_the/) ([Score: 162, Comments: 188](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1lx7iak/this_subs_incorrect_use_of_the_word_we_in_the/)): **The post critiques the AI/LLM community's use of inclusive language ("we") when discussing AGI and alignment, emphasizing the fragmented, competitive nature of AI development across corporate, national, and team boundaries—analogizing it to the secretive, militaristic development of atomic weapons rather than a unified scientific effort. The author argues that major technological advancements are typically leveraged first for domination and control (e.g., nuclear weapons), and warns that AGI will follow this historical precedent rather than serving humanity collectively or altruistically.** Top comments echo skepticism that the benefits of AGI/LLM development will be distributed widely, asserting economic and social inequality will increase as powerful individuals and entities capture the rewards. Some users cite individuals like David Sacks and Elon Musk to argue the ruling class is uninterested in universal welfare or alignment, while others simply express dissent or reinforce the original critique.
    - A key technical concern highlighted is the disconnect between the beneficiaries of AI advancement and those who will bear negative impacts; the comment specifically references leading industry figures like Elon Musk ("mecha hitler and will have robots soon"), Sam Altman (OpenAI leadership), Peter Thiel (AI surveillance), and David Sacks (opposition to UBI), arguing that these decision-makers do not prioritize societal welfare, of which broad AI deployment and automation could significantly disrupt employment and increase inequality.
    - There is an implicit comparison between the rapid, competitive drive for AGI and the historic arms race for atomic weapons, conveying the urgency of collective alignment and ethical considerations in AGI development, as decisions are concentrated among a small group of powerful actors rather than the broader public or the technical community.

> `GPT-4o Model Degradation, Custom GPT limitations, GPT-4o vs GPT-4o mini` 


- **GPT-4o Model Silently Downgrades to Mini**: Free GPT-4o users are silently downgraded to **GPT-4o mini** once they hit a daily quota as of July 2025, which severely impacts context window and model quality.
   - The lack of manual switching and clear indicators frustrate users, as the **mini** version significantly degrades long-term roleplay experiences due to diminished memory and response quality.
- **Custom GPTs Face Memory Constraints**: Custom GPTs with Plus memberships offer some benefits but still cannot maintain comprehensive memory across threads indefinitely, making them unsuitable for persistent, detailed roleplay scenarios.
   - While uploading summary files and providing clear instructions helps, users face limitations on the number of files and the GPT's capacity to process extensive, unstructured documents, thus requiring concise summaries.
- **Bypass the GPT-4o Limits with Plus version**: One approach suggested involves dividing conversations into smaller **docx files (80,000 characters each)** and submitting them sequentially to 'recreate' the story in new chats.
   - Accessing the *projects tab* of GPT with a **Plus version** subscription may offer an even better solution, though this feature's availability is still limited.

- ****Orpheus TTS gets the `torchcodec` blues****: Users reported errors in the Orpheus_(3B)-TTS notebook, specifically an `ImportError: To support decoding audio data, please install 'torchcodec'.` error at the line `ds_sample_rate = dataset[0]["audio"]["sampling_rate"]`.
   - The solution involved downgrading the datasets version to `datasets==3.4.1`, as newer versions require `torchcodec` and a higher version of torch (2.7.1) than what Colab provides.
- ****Multi-GPU Patience Wanes****: Users are still waiting for multi-GPU support, initially expected in April, with no updates available on the main thread.
   - No ETA was provided as of latest messages.
- ****Nemo 12B Notebook nightmares with Jupyter local installs****: Users encountered `Unexpected type of attr triton.multi_kernel, got bool should be int` when trying to run the Nemo 12B notebook in a local Jupyter environment.
   - It was recommended to create a separate Python environment for Unsloth and launch Jupyter from within that environment to avoid conflicts with system-wide Python installations, see [this discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1179035537009545276/1179035537529643040/1381978312640958515).

   - The method uses **LDLQ quants**, which are technically **IQ quants**, not Q quants, and someone wondered about applying this technique to Qwen32b.
- **AI slows OS Dev down by 19%**: A study ([metr.org](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/)) found that developers using AI tools take **19% longer** than those without, suggesting AI may hinder thinking and ownership.
   - It discourages thinking, discourages ownership. Perhaps not too surprising?
- **Kimi-K2-Base achieves SOTA in nonreasoning**: **Kimi-K2-Base** ([huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Base)) is claimed as a new **SOTA-class nonreasoning model** with exceptional performance across knowledge, reasoning, and coding tasks, optimized for agentic capabilities.
   - Users stated *its very very strong without* the need for account creation & log in
- **Rumors swirling around GPT 4.5 Model Size**: **GPT 4.5** is rumored to be **12T A2T**, while **GPT 4** is **1.76T A288B** according to NVIDIA, suggesting a significant increase in size.
   - It was stated that **GPT-4.5** may be around 10tn moe as well, but they can't inference it so they shrunk it down considerably for **gpt-4.1**
- **Active Parameter Count Debated**: It was stated *i am sick of people saying oh but the active parameter count is much less... if it needs the resources of a 1T parameter model, then it might as well just be called a 1T parameter model with the speed of a 32B*.
   - Others say they are making incredibly large models. If you look at the data, you can get pretty far with a 32b dense, then if you upgrade to a 200b param model, its better again, then a 700b (DeepSeek) class model is basically the whole way there, but there is still a small gap.

- **Newbie's Float32 Transpose Mission Begins**: A new member to ThunderKittens is trying to get **Float32 matrix transpose** working, and is using it as an exercise to learn the framework.
   - They are attempting this kernel using the `transpose_sep` function, but it throws an error related to incompatible types, as `transpose_sep` [only supports bf16](https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens/blob/545bdcc55b49dfa9989a1ed63e3574dba706a27f/include/ops/warp/register/tile/conversions.cuh#L13-L201).
- **Need new tile op for float32 transpose**: The new member will likely need to write their own **tile op** for transposing **float32** tiles due to the lack of existing support in the library.
   - They found that the [transpose functions in ThunderKittens](https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens/blob/545bdcc55b49dfa9989a1ed63e3574dba706a27f/include/ops/warp/register/tile/conversions.cuh#L13-L201) only support `bf16`.

> `CuteDSL Limitations, Dynamic Values in CuteDSL, Tensor Allocation in CuteDSL, tensor core performance` 


- **CuteDSL's Limitations are more or less Fundamental**: Some limitations in CuteDSL are technically solvable but come with a cost, such as switching to unstructured control flow for early exits, which complicates compiler analysis and hurts performance.
   - The team is unlikely to support python-style dynamic behavior where types are determined at runtime, due to complexity and performance concerns.
- **Dynamic Values Impact Metaprogramming in CuteDSL**: Values yield from dynamic conditions, like in `if` statements, become dynamic values themselves, which means metaprogramming won't work for them and they're treated as unknown at compile time.
   - A dynamic value means that compile-time optimizations relying on `const_expr` will not be applicable and meta-programming on the values is forbidden.
- **Static Values in CuteDSL**: A variable assigned a constant value (e.g., `a = 5`) is a const expr in CuteDSL, but returning dynamic values from `@cute.jit` functions is currently not fully supported, though a fix is planned.
   - While returning static values from `@cute.jit` functions may appear to work, it's not the intended behavior for early releases.
- **Tensor Core efficiency caveats**: Tensor core performance can be worse if the problem size has too large a granularity.
   - In extreme cases, Tensor Core could have an efficiency of 1/128 depending on the size of the problem.
- **Allocation of Local Tensors in CuteDSL**: Users found that `cute.full` is an adequate method to allocate a local tensor which can be accumulated over.
   - The user initially wanted to allocate a local tensor to accumulate over, but found a solution without using the shared memory allocator.

> `LLMs and Em Dashes, ByteDance MoE Kernels, Tokenizer-Free Models, N-Simplical Attention` 


- **LLMs' Dash for Em Dashes**: Members were curious why **LLMs** use **em dashes** so frequently, suspecting it's a learned behavior from **RLHF** due to preference data where people perceive **em dashes** as indicators of intelligence.
   - It was also considered that the model might learn this from pretraining, as models can exhibit more extreme biases than training data frequency suggests.
- **ByteDance's Comm-Compute Overlap Kernel Questioned**: A member questioned [ByteDance's MoE kernel paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19811) regarding their *all-gather -> scatter -> FFN -> reduce scatter* pattern, contrasting it with the *all2all dispatch -> token permutation -> FFN -> all2all combine* approach.
   - The confusion stems from the paper's mention of **all2all** comms in diagrams, raising questions about why all tokens would need to be gathered when devices have different experts.
- **Tokenizer-Free Models skip Whitespace**: A member noticed that the [Tokenizer-free models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=zGej22CBnS) effectively skip whitespace.

> `Mixed Precision arg for HFLMs, Harness Evaluation Speed, Loading Models with Correct Dtype, Softmax Defaulting to Float32, Mixed Precision PR` 


- **Mixed Precision Argument Proposed for HFLMs**: A member suggested adding a `mixed_precision` argument for HFLMs, which would automatically wrap model calls inside `autocast` regions for models with mixed weight dtypes, like VLMs, to help users integrating the harness into their training codebases.
   - This feature would simplify the process of loading multi-dtype models from the CLI, providing a more user-friendly experience for those working with complex model configurations.
- **Harness Evaluation Plagued by Slow Speed**: A user reported that LM-Eval Harness was taking **22 minutes** for Hellaswag 0-shot on a local llama2 7b fine-tune, despite specifying the device map to cuda:4 and batch size set to auto.
   - Members suggested ensuring the model is loaded with the correct dtype (FP16/BF16) to enable flash attention and provided guidance on manually setting the dtype in the CLI using the `--model_args` parameter.
- **Loading Correct Dtype to Solve Slowness**: Members debugged the reported slowness issue by reminding the user to load the model with the correct dtype, specifically noting that loading in FP32 instead of FP16/BF16 would prevent the use of flash attention.
   - It was suggested to verify the `attn_implentation` config variable is set to flash and to manually cast the model to BF16 in a Python script to rule out harness performance regressions.
- **Defaulting Softmax to Float32 is Good**: A member asked for opinions on defaulting to float32 for the softmax function, with another member responding positively, citing that doing so is good, and just needs to be added to HF, also wondering how it interacts with `accelerate`.
   - The member noted they had observed differences in eval results between 32 vs 16, so they'd be more likely trust the 32 result over the 16 result.
- **Mixed Precision PR Dropped, Speed Gains Seen**: A member announced the dropping of a mixed precision PR: [EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/pull/3138](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/pull/3138), and also followed up with test results evaluating pythia-160M's speed gains.
   - Results show mixed precision is only slightly slower than casting the full model and naturally much faster than full precision, for example Hellaswag went from `01:52` time to `00:33` time.
