# AI Twitter Recap

**DeepSeek V3.2-Exp: Sparse Attention, price cuts, and open kernels**

- **DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) lands (open) with big efficiency wins**: DeepSeek released an experimental V3.2-Exp model that retrofits V3.1-Terminus with a learned sparse attention scheme, cutting long-context costs without quality loss. A tiny “lightning indexer” scores past tokens per query, selects top‑k positions, and the backbone runs full attention only on those, changing complexity from O[L^2] to O[Lk]. Two-stage continual pretraining on top of V3.1: a dense warm‑up (~2.1B tokens, backbone frozen) aligns the indexer to dense attention via KL loss; then end‑to‑end sparse training (~944B tokens) adapts the backbone to the indexer with KL regularization. Models, tech report, and kernels are released; API prices drop 50%+ with claimed ~3.5x cheaper prefill and ~10x cheaper decode at 128k context, with quality matching V3.1. See the launch thread [@deepseek_ai](https://twitter.com/deepseek_ai/status/1972604768309871061), pricing/API notes [3/n](https://twitter.com/deepseek_ai/status/1972604777474458033) and code [4/n](https://twitter.com/deepseek_ai/status/1972604780469239843). Deep breakdowns from [@danielhanchen](https://twitter.com/danielhanchen/status/1972613546119991791) and [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1972613330209485282).
- **Ecosystem and compilers**: vLLM has DSA support recipes and H200/B200 builds ([vLLM](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/1972664010702221399), DSA explainer [1/3](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/1972617272901644345)). DeepSeek’s kernels ship in TileLang/CUDA; TileLang (TVM) hits ~95% of hand-written FlashMLA in ~80 lines and targets Nvidia, Huawei Ascend, Cambricon ([@Yuchenj_UW](https://twitter.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/1972698599554490856)). Community reactions highlight that DSA’s post‑hoc sparsification on a dense checkpoint generalizes beyond DeepSeek ([analysis](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1972608415051723105)).
- **Post-training recipe**: DeepSeek confirms RL on specialist models (math, competitive programming, general reasoning, agentic coding, agentic search) with GRPO and rubric/consistency rewards, then distillation into the final checkpoint; SPCT/GRM used in RL stages ([notes](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1972627894636814585), [confirm](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1972611028442861675)).

**Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5: coding/agent leap and first interpretability audit in a system card**

- **New SOTA for coding and agents**: Anthropic launched Sonnet 4.5, claiming best-in-class coding, computer use, and reasoning/math. It sets a new high on SWE‑Bench Verified (no tools) and shows large gains on OSWorld (computer use), plus long autonomous coding runs (e.g., building/maintaining a codebase over 30+ hours, ~11k LOC) ([launch](https://twitter.com/claudeai/status/1972706807345725773), [Cognition/Devin rebuild](https://twitter.com/cognition/status/1972709846937157704), [long-run coding](https://twitter.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/1972708720527425966), [finance/programming evals](https://twitter.com/_valsai/status/1972707249748582454)). Pricing remains $3M/$15M (input/output) with 200k default context and a 1M option for some partners ([Cline](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1972708023232852309)).
- **Alignment and interpretability work surfaced**: Anthropic published a detailed system card; they report substantially reduced sycophancy/reward hacking and “evaluation awareness” signals discovered via interpretability. The team did a pre-deployment white‑box audit to “read the model’s mind” (to their knowledge, a first for a frontier LLM system card). See [@janleike](https://twitter.com/janleike/status/1972731237480718734), the audit thread by [@Jack_W_Lindsey](https://twitter.com/Jack_W_Lindsey/status/1972732219795153126), and system-card highlights ([1](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1972713543775682654), [2](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1972713224727412804)).
- **Tooling and integrations**: Claude Code v2 ships checkpoints, UX improvements, and a native VS Code extension; the Claude Code SDK is now the Claude Agent SDK aimed at general agents ([@_catwu](https://twitter.com/_catwu/status/1972711105157054772), [@alexalbert__](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1972718342197981194)). Broad availability landed in Cursor (now with browser control), Perplexity, and OpenRouter ([Cursor add](https://twitter.com/cursor_ai/status/1972713190074261949), [browser control](https://twitter.com/cursor_ai/status/1972778817854067188), [Perplexity](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1972751588629545329), [OpenRouter](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1972708145253188072)). Case studies: replicating published econ research from raw data using code execution/file creation ([@emollick](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1972709877823721526), [@alexalbert__](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1972749073016132018)).

**RL for LLMs: GRPO vs PPO vs REINFORCE, and LoRA matches full FT in many settings**

- **GRPO discourse, grounded**: Practitioners with OAI/Anthropic RL experience argue GRPO is essentially a policy-gradient variant of REINFORCE with group baselines; performance differences among reasonable PG variants (GRPO, RLOO, PPO, SPO) are often smaller than gaps in data recipe, credit assignment, and variance reduction. See high-signal threads by [@McaleerStephen](https://twitter.com/McaleerStephen/status/1972464814808240592) and [@zhongwen2009](https://twitter.com/zhongwen2009/status/1972491368057684096), plus a workflow explainer ([@TheTuringPost](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/1972726875056390146)). For those avoiding PPO complexity, REINFORCE/RLOO work well and avoid a value model (lower cost) ([@cwolferesearch](https://twitter.com/cwolferesearch/status/1972683435786338540)).
- **LoRA holds up in RL**: New experiments indicate LoRA can match full fine‑tuning in many RL post‑training regimes, even at low rank; corroborated by QLoRA experience (>1500 expts) and recent GRPO implementations ([@thinkymachines](https://twitter.com/thinkymachines/status/1972708674100765006), [@Tim_Dettmers](https://twitter.com/Tim_Dettmers/status/1972719016067453133), [@danielhanchen](https://twitter.com/danielhanchen/status/1972758514369200227)). NVIDIA also proposes RLBFF (binary principle‑based feedback combining RLHF/RLVR) with strong RM-Bench/JudgeBench results ([overview](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/1972631189136806257), [paper](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/1972631291272335542)).
- **Data is the bottleneck debate continues**: [@fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1972477946700190081) stresses that scaling LLMs has been data-bound (human-generated and environment-crafted), while “AGI” might be compute‑bound; meanwhile OpenAI’s GDPVal dataset is trending on HF ([@ClementDelangue](https://twitter.com/ClementDelangue/status/1972640079559749632)) and the community calls for updated evals beyond saturated MMLU ([@maximelabonne](https://twitter.com/maximelabonne/status/1972615048511250647)).

**Agentic commerce and platform updates**

- **OpenAI Instant Checkout + Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)**: ChatGPT now supports buying directly in-chat, starting with Etsy and “over a million” Shopify merchants coming soon. ACP is co-developed with Stripe as an open standard for programmatic commerce between users, AI agents, and businesses. Developers can apply to integrate; details via [@OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1972708279043367238), [@OpenAIDevs](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1972712933080920451), [docs](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1972713154598871541), and Stripe’s perspective ([Patrick Collison](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1972716417280860391), [SemiAnalysis](https://twitter.com/SemiAnalysis_/status/1972714269839163901)). In parallel, Google introduced AP2 (agent payments) with cryptographically signed mandates ([DeepLearningAI](https://twitter.com/DeepLearningAI/status/1972723046168289689)).
- **Safety & governance**: OpenAI rolled out parental controls (link teen/parent accounts, granular controls, self-harm risk notifications) ([announcement](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1972604360204210600), [@fidjissimo](https://twitter.com/fidjissimo/status/1972602249907146967)). Anthropic backed California’s SB53 for frontier AI transparency while preferring federal frameworks ([@jackclarkSF](https://twitter.com/jackclarkSF/status/1972773280877826232)). OpenAI also opened “OpenAI for Science” roles to build an AI-powered scientific instrument ([@kevinweil](https://twitter.com/kevinweil/status/1972706870042440051)).

**Infra, kernels, and other releases**

- **Systems and compilers**: Modal raised a $87M Series B (now a “B”illion valuation) to keep building ML-native infra; customers highlight the “remote but feels local” DX and scaling ergonomics ([@bernhardsson](https://twitter.com/bernhardsson/status/1972649681701486821), [@HamelHusain](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1972660215658189049), [@raunakdoesdev](https://twitter.com/raunakdoesdev/status/1972755957047587178)). For GPU internals, a widely-praised deep dive on writing high-performance matmul kernels on H100 covers memory hierarchy, PTX/SASS, warp tiling, TMA/wgmma, and scheduling ([@gordic_aleksa](https://twitter.com/gordic_aleksa/status/1972696444101632151), [@cHHillee](https://twitter.com/cHHillee/status/1972782935859401155)).
- **Other model drops**: Google’s TimesFM 2.5 (200M params, 16k context, Apache-2.0) is a stronger zero-shot time-series forecaster ([@osanseviero](https://twitter.com/osanseviero/status/1972609699007910071)). AntLingAGI previewed Ring‑1T, a 1T-parameter open “thinking” model with early results on AIME25/HMMT/ARC-AGI and an IMO’25 Q3 solve ([@AntLingAGI](https://twitter.com/AntLingAGI/status/1972711364876697612)). On vision, Tencent’s HunyuanImage 3 joined community testbeds ([Yupp](https://twitter.com/yupp_ai/status/1972449455627727056)), and Qwen-Image-Edit‑2509 showcased robust style transfer for architectural scenes ([@Alibaba_Qwen](https://twitter.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/1972558448626987264)).

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. China AI Model Launches: Alibaba Qwen Scaling Roadmap and Tencent Hunyuan Image 3.0

- [**Alibaba just unveiled their Qwen roadmap. The ambition is staggering!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nq182d/alibaba_just_unveiled_their_qwen_roadmap_the/) (Activity: 954): **Alibaba’s Qwen roadmap slide (image) lays out two bets: a unified multimodal model family and extreme scaling. Targets include context window growth from** `1M → 100M` **tokens, parameter count from ~**`1T → 10T`**, test-time compute budget from** `64k → 1M` **(implying much longer CoT/drafting), and data scale from** `10T → 100T` **tokens. It also highlights unbounded synthetic data generation and expanded agent capabilities (task complexity, interaction, learning modes), signaling a strong “scaling is all you need” strategy.** Commenters are wowed by the `100M` context, skeptical it will remain open-source at that scale, and note that running >1T-parameter models locally is impractical for consumer hardware.
    - Ambition for a `100M` token context sparked feasibility analysis: with standard attention, compute is O(L^2) and KV-cache memory scales linearly with L. For a 7B-class transformer (≈32 layers, 32 heads, head_dim 128), even with 8‑bit KV, the cache is ~`256 KB/token`, implying ~`25 TB` just for KV at 100M tokens; fp16 would double that. Commenters note such lengths would require architectural/algorithmic changes (e.g., retrieval, recurrent/state-space models, or linear/streaming attention; see ideas like [Ring Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01889) or limitations of [FlashAttention-3](https://tridao.me/publications/flashattention3/flashattention3.pdf), which still has O(L^2) compute).
    - On running >`1T`parameter models locally: weight storage alone is prohibitive—`fp16 ≈ 2 TB`, `int8 ≈ 1 TB`, `4‑bit ≈ 0.5 TB`—before activations and KV cache. Even ignoring KV, you’d need on the order of `13× H100 80GB` GPUs just to hold 1 TB of int8 weights, plus high-bandwidth NVLink/NVSwitch; PCIe workstations would be bandwidth-bound with single-digit tokens/s if offloading to CPU/NVMe. KV grows with both model depth and context (e.g., Llama‑70B-scale models are ~`~1.25 MB/token` at 8‑bit KV, so long contexts quickly add tens to hundreds of GB), making “local” inference for trillion‑scale models impractical.
    - Licensing/openness concerns were raised: speculation that ultra-long-context or frontier Qwen checkpoints may be closed or API-only even if smaller Qwen variants remain open-weight. The technical implication discussed is that reproducibility and third‑party benchmarking of such extreme context lengths may depend on whether training/inference codepaths (e.g., specialized attention kernels, memory planners) and weights are released versus restricted to hosted endpoints.
- [**Tencent is teasing the world’s most powerful open-source text-to-image model, Hunyuan Image 3.0 Drops Sept 28**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nqaiaz/tencent_is_teasing_the_worlds_most_powerful/) (Activity: 225): **Tencent is teasing Hunyuan Image 3.0, an open‑source text‑to‑image model slated for release on Sept 28, claiming it will be the “most powerful” open‑source T2I model. The teaser provides no technical specs or benchmarks; a commenter asserts a** `96 GB VRAM` **figure, but no official details on architecture, training data, resolution/sampler support, or inference requirements are given. [Teaser image](https://i.redd.it/t8w84ihz1crf1.jpeg).** Commenters are skeptical of pre‑release hype, noting strong models often “shadow drop” (e.g., Qwen) while hyped releases can disappoint (e.g., SD3 vs. Flux). Others argue the “most powerful” claim is unverified until comparable open‑source contenders are publicly measured.
    - A commenter claims a `~96 GB VRAM` requirement, implying a very large memory footprint for inference. If accurate, this would push usage toward A100/H100-class GPUs or multi-GPU/offload setups and limit practicality on 24–48 GB consumer cards unless quantization or CPU/NVMe offloading is available. Official details on batch size, target resolution, and precision (fp16/bf16/fp8) will be crucial to interpret the VRAM figure.
    - Skepticism around pre-release hype is strong: users note that heavily teased models often underdeliver versus "shadow-dropped" releases. Cited contrasts include **Qwen** models quietly releasing with solid quality versus hyped teasers like GPT-5, and the SD3 marketing compared to **Flux**’s reception. Takeaway: wait for third-party benchmarks and controlled A/Bs before accepting "most powerful" claims.
    - The "most powerful open-source" claim is questioned pending head-to-heads against open models (e.g., Qwen Image, SD3, Flux) on fidelity, prompt adherence, and speed. Integration concerns ("when ComfyUI") underscore the need for immediate pipeline/tooling support and optimized inference graphs. Credible evaluation should report hardware/precision settings and throughput (it/s) alongside sample galleries.

### 2. Fenghua No.3 GPU API Support and Post-abliteration Uncensored LLM Finetuning

- [**China already started making CUDA and DirectX supporting GPUs, so over of monopoly of NVIDIA. The Fenghua No.3 supports latest APIs, including DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.2, and OpenGL 4.6.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nq1ia2/china_already_started_making_cuda_and_directx/) (Activity: 702): **Post claims a Chinese discrete GPU "Fenghua No.3" supports modern graphics APIs—DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.2, OpenGL 4.6—and advertises CUDA support, implying an attempt to run CUDA workloads on non‑NVIDIA hardware. No performance data, ISA/compiler details, or driver maturity info are provided; CUDA support may rely on a compatibility/translation layer, so coverage (PTX versions, runtime APIs) and perf remain unknown.** Commenters note AMD’s HIP (a CUDA‑like API) and projects like ZLUDA (CUDA translation on other GPUs) as precedents, suggesting Chinese vendors may implement CUDA more directly due to fewer legal constraints, while others are skeptical until real benchmarks/demos are shown.
    - AMD already offers a CUDA-compatibility route via **HIP**, which mirrors CUDA runtime/kernel APIs but with renamed symbols to sidestep NVIDIA licensing; tooling like **HIPIFY** can auto-translate CUDA code to HIP targeting **ROCm** backends ([HIP](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP), [HIPIFY](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIPIFY)). Projects such as **ZLUDA** provide a binary-compatibility layer that maps CUDA runtime/driver calls and PTX to other GPU backends (initially Intel Level Zero, with active forks targeting AMD ROCm), aiming for minimal overhead and running unmodified CUDA apps ([ZLUDA repo](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA)). This context suggests Chinese vendors could directly implement the CUDA runtime/driver ABI to maximize compatibility, whereas Western vendors typically rely on translation layers to avoid legal risk.
- [**IMPORTANT: Why Abliterated Models SUCK. Here is a better way to uncensor LLMs.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nq0cp9/important_why_abliterated_models_suck_here_is_a/) (Activity: 433): **OP reports that “abliteration” (uncensoring via weight surgery) consistently degrades capability—especially on MoE like Qwen3-30B-A3B—with drops in logical reasoning, tool-use/agentic control, and much higher hallucination, sometimes making 30B worse than clean 4–8B baselines. In contrast, abliteration followed by finetuning (SFT/DPO) largely restores performance: e.g., [mradermacher/Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-erotic-i1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-erotic-i1-GGUF) (tested at** `i1-Q4_K_S`**) is close to the base model with lower hallucinations and better tool-calling than other abliterated Qwen3 variants, and [mlabonne/NeuralDaredevil-8B-abliterated](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/NeuralDaredevil-8B-abliterated) (DPO on Llama3-8B) reportedly outperforms its base while remaining uncensored. Comparative baselines that underperformed included [Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507-abliterated-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507-abliterated-GGUF), [Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-Fusion-9010-i1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-Fusion-9010-i1-GGUF), and [Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-abliterated-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-abliterated-GGUF), which showed poor MCP/tool-call selection and spammy behavior, plus elevated hallucinations; the erotic-i1 model remained slightly weaker than the original Qwen3-30B-A3B on agentic tasks. OP’s hypothesis: post-abliteration finetuning "heals" performance lost by unconstrained weight edits.** Comments call for a standardized benchmark for “abliteration” effects beyond NSFW tasks; others frame the observation as known “model healing,” i.e., further training lets the network re-learn connections damaged by weight edits. A critical view argues that if finetuning fixes things, abliteration may be unnecessary—"I've never seen ablit+finetune beat just finetune"—and that removing safety/“negative biases” often harms general usability.
    - Multiple commenters call for a capability-oriented benchmark to evaluate 'abliteration' side-effects beyond NSFW outputs; the **Uncensored General Intelligence (UGI)** leaderboard explicitly targets uncensored-model performance across diverse tasks: https://huggingface.co/spaces/DontPlanToEnd/UGI-Leaderboard. A standardized suite would enable apples-to-apples comparisons between ablated, fine-tuned, and baseline models on reasoning, instruction-following, and refusal behavior instead of anecdotal porn-only tests.
    - Weight-level 'abliteration' without a guiding loss predictably breaks distributed representations; *'When you do any alteration to a neural network's weights that's not constrained by a loss function, you should expect degradation or destruction of the model's capabilities.'* **Model healing**—continuing training (SFT/RL) after the edit—can help the network rediscover severed connections, so evaluations should report pre- and post-healing performance to quantify recoverable vs irrecoverable damage.
    - Practitioners argue that ablation+fine-tuning hasn't outperformed a clean fine-tune: *'I've never seen abliterated fine-tune perform better than just a fine-tune, at anything.'* Instead, uncensoring via instruction/data tuning preserves base capabilities while reducing refusals, e.g., **Josiefied** and **Dolphin** variants: Qwen3-8B-`192k`Josiefied-Uncensored-NEO-Max-GGUF (https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-8B-192k-Josiefied-Uncensored-NEO-Max-GGUF), Dolphin-Mistral-24B-Venice-Edition-i1-GGUF (https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Dolphin-Mistral-24B-Venice-Edition-i1-GGUF), and models by **TheDrummer** (https://huggingface.co/TheDrummer).

### 1. Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 Launch, Features, and Benchmarks

- [**Claude 4.5 Sonnet is here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ntnegj/claude_45_sonnet_is_here/) (Activity: 1116): **Anthropic announced “Claude Sonnet 4.5” ([release notes](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5)), emphasizing improved tool-use and agentic workflows: *“Enhanced tool usage: The model more effectively uses parallel tool calls, firing off multiple speculative searches simultaneously … reading several files at once to build context faster,”* with better coordination across tools for research and coding. The upgrade focuses on concurrency (parallel calls), multi-file ingestion, and faster context assembly, signaling optimizations for tool-augmented reasoning rather than just raw model scaling.** Commenters report a noticeable real-world speed/quality bump and speculate prior A/B testing exposed some users to the new parallelism earlier; perceived gains align with the release note’s focus on parallel tool calls and multi-file processing.
    - Release notes emphasize improved tool orchestration: *"Enhanced tool usage... parallel tool calls, firing off multiple speculative searches simultaneously... reading several files at once to build context faster"*, indicating better concurrency and coordination across tools for agentic search/coding workflows. A user corroborates this with an earlier observation that Sonnet felt markedly faster and appeared to run parallel tool calls during a period of inference issues, speculating they were part of an A/B test; they link their prior note for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ndafeq/3month_claude_code_max_user_review_considering/ndgevtn/?context=3.
    - Another commenter highlights ecosystem impact: with widespread use of **Claude Code** (and analogs like **Codex** and **Grok**), even marginal gains in parallel tool-call efficiency and latency can compound across millions of users and agent scaffolds. This suggests 4.5 Sonnet’s improved multi-tool coordination could unlock more complex, lower-latency pipelines in agentic workflows, benefiting both end-users and developers building orchestration frameworks.
- [**Introducing Claude Sonnet 4.5**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ntnhyh/introducing_claude_sonnet_45/) (Activity: 1512): **Anthropic announced Claude Sonnet 4.5, positioning it as its strongest coding/agent model with gains in reasoning and math (no benchmark numbers provided). Platform-wide upgrades include: Claude Code (new terminal UI, a VS Code extension, and a checkpoints feature for instant rollback), the Claude App (code-execution to analyze data, create files, and visualize insights; Chrome extension rollout), and the Developer Platform (longer-running agents via stale-context clearing plus a new memory tool; an Agent SDK exposing core tools, context management, and permissions). A research preview, [Imagine with Claude](https://claude.ai/imagine), generates software on-the-fly with no prewritten functionality, available to Max users for** `5 days`**. Sonnet 4.5 is available in the app, Claude Code, the Developer Platform, and via [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and [Google Cloud Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai); pricing remains** `unchanged` **from Sonnet 4. Full announcement: [anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5).** Comments ask whether Sonnet 4.5 surpasses Opus 4.1 across the board and anticipate a new Opus release; no comparative benchmarks are cited. Other remarks are largely non-technical enthusiasm.
    - Several commenters ask whether Sonnet 4.5 actually surpasses both **Claude 3 Opus** and **OpenAI GPT-4.1** for coding, requesting head-to-head benchmarks and apples-to-apples eval methodology. They specifically want pass@1 on coding sets like **HumanEval** and **SWE-bench**, plus latency, context-window limits, and tool-use reliability under identical constraints (temperature, stop sequences, timeouts). Links requested for clarity: Claude 3 family overview (https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family), GPT‑4.1 announcement (https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-1/), and HumanEval (https://github.com/openai/human-eval).
    - The “best coding model” claim prompts requests for concrete coding metrics: `pass@1`/`pass@k` on HumanEval/MBPP, `SWE-bench (Verified)` solve rate, multi-file/refactoring performance, and compile/run success rates for generated code. Commenters also want data on deterministic behavior at `temperature=0`, function/tool-calling robustness, long-context code navigation (e.g., >100k tokens), streaming latency under load, and regression analysis versus prior Sonnet/Opus releases.
    - Enterprise-readiness questions focus on security/compliance (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA/BAA), data governance (zero-retention options, customer-managed keys/KMS), deployment (VPC/private networking, regional data residency), and enterprise controls (SSO/SAML, audit logs, rate limits/quotas). They also ask for concrete SLAs (uptime, incident response), throughput ceilings (tokens/min), and pricing tiers, ideally documented on a trust/compliance page (e.g., https://www.anthropic.com/trust).
- [**Claude 4.5 does 30 hours of autonomous coding**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nto74a/claude_45_does_30_hours_of_autonomous_coding/) (Activity: 508): **The post showcases a marketing-style claim that Claude 4.5 can sustain “~30 hours of autonomous coding,” but provides no technical evidence: no benchmarks, repo links, agent architecture, tool-use loop details, or evaluation of code quality/maintainability. Discussion frames this as an agent-run endurance claim (similar to earlier “8+ hours” for Claude 4) rather than a measurable capability with reproducible methodology or QA metrics.** Top comments are skeptical: they argue long agent runs tend to yield brittle, hard-to-maintain code; urge Anthropic to stop making hour-count claims without proof; and question whether Anthropic is already relying on Claude-generated code internally.
    - Skeptics argue that a claimed `30h` autonomous coding run tends to produce code that’s brittle to change: without deliberate architecture, modularization, and tests, adding features later often forces rewrites. They note LLM agents frequently optimize for immediate completion over long-term maintainability, lacking patterns like clear interfaces, dependency inversion, and regression test suites that guard extensibility.
    - Multiple reports highlight **dependency hallucination** and execution loops: the model invents library names, cycles through guesses, and burns compute retrying installs. Without guardrails like strict lockfiles, offline/package indexes, deterministic environment provisioning, and automated checks on `pip`/build errors, agents stall; a **human-in-the-loop** remains necessary for package discovery, version pinning, and resolving import/build failures.
    - Commenters question the advertising of “`30h` autonomous” (similar to prior “`8+ hours`”) without transparent evaluation details—e.g., tool-call logs, wall-clock vs. active compute, number of human interventions, and task success criteria. They call for rigorous metrics like unit-test pass rates, reproducibility across seeds/runs, defect/rollback rates post-run, and comparison against baselines to substantiate autonomy claims.
- [**Introducing Claude Usage Limit Meter**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ntq8tv/introducing_claude_usage_limit_meter/) (Activity: 588): **Anthropic adds a real-time usage meter across Claude Code (via a** `/usage` **slash command) and Claude apps (Settings → Usage). The previously announced weekly rate limits are rolling out now; with Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic expects fewer than** `2%` **of users to hit the caps. The image likely shows the new usage UI displaying current percentage used and remaining allowance.** Comments note the company “listened,” but experiences vary: some heavy users on the $100 plan report only ~5% usage after a full day, while others hit session limits and face multi-hour (~5h) cooldowns, suggesting session-based throttling can be disruptive.
    - Early anecdote: on the `$100` plan, a full day of coding registered only `5%` on the new meter. Without units (tokens/messages/tool calls) the meter’s calibration is unclear; if accurate, it implies a relatively high ceiling for typical dev workflows, but makes it hard to predict when the hard cap is reached. This also aligns with the idea that only a small subset of heavy users hit limits, but the meter finally provides visibility for self-calibration.
    - One report says exhausting "pro session usage" leads to a forced wait of roughly `5 hours`, implying a rolling time-window or fixed reset interval rather than pure per-message throttling. This impacts debugging workflows: if the assistant fails to fix an issue before the cap, iteration stalls until the window resets, suggesting limits are enforced at a session/account level.
    - Users are asking for concrete limits on the "20x plan," but no numeric caps were shared in-thread. There’s a need for documented per-tier ceilings (e.g., messages per hour/day, token budgets, and how the meter maps to those) and clarity on whether higher tiers modify cooldown windows or only increase total allowance.

### 2. OpenAI/ChatGPT Ads, Forced Model Changes, and Community Backlash

- [**Want to lose customers fast? Go ahead, advertise on OpenAI. We'll remember.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nt6n59/want_to_lose_customers_fast_go_ahead_advertise_on/) (Activity: 784): **OP claims OpenAI will introduce ads into the ChatGPT interface and frames it as a post-quality-downgrade monetization step. The post argues that in-product ads risk eroding user trust and brand perception, with an explicit intent to boycott advertisers; it also implies potential subscription churn if ads touch paid tiers (e.g., Pro).** Top comments predict an "enshittification" sequence (great features → lock-in → quality degradation → ads), warn they’ll cancel Pro if ads appear in paid plans, and express skepticism that the platform can degrade further.
- [**Everyone just cancel the subscription.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nt9liu/everyone_just_cancel_the_subscription/) (Activity: 1415): **OP urges mass cancellation of a paid AI subscription due to a newly "forced" feature that auto‑reroutes conversations into a safety/guardrailed chat and removes user control over model selection. They note the free tier isn’t being rerouted in their case and provides sufficient access for their needs, arguing there’s no benefit to paying if model choice is constrained and usage can be replicated on the free plan (albeit with lower limits).** Top comments split: one user canceled, saying their use cases work on the free tier with the same model and fewer tokens/limits and they’d rather pay for another AI that doesn’t force safety reroutes; another user is satisfied with the current product and will switch only if it degrades; a third expresses frustration with repeated complaints.
    - Several users point out the ChatGPT UI now "reroutes into a safety chat," which changes behavior and removes some use cases; one notes that with those constraints, the free tier suffices since it feels like the "same model" with lower limits. A suggested workaround is redirecting spend to other providers or using the OpenAI API instead of the ChatGPT app to avoid UI-level routing and retain full model behavior (see model list: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o).
    - A technical distinction is made between ChatGPT (subscription UI) and the OpenAI API: one commenter claims API access to **GPT‑4o** is "not routed the same way as ChatGPT," recommending pay‑as‑you‑go via the API to preserve capabilities while avoiding safety-chat constraints (pricing: https://openai.com/pricing). They also note that access to Custom GPTs is tied to a subscription (Plus/Team/Enterprise) while API usage is separately billed (about GPTs: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554406-what-are-gpts); the mention of "GPT‑5" likely reflects a user-defined label rather than an official, documented model family (public models: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o).
    - One user suggests mass cancellations would yield a "big performance boost" for remaining subscribers; in practice, capacity is typically managed via autoscaling and rate limits, so churn doesn’t directly translate to proportional latency/throughput gains. If performance bottlenecks stem from moderation/safety routing in the ChatGPT UI, shifting to lower-overhead endpoints and streaming via the API (e.g., Realtime guides: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) is a more technically grounded path to reduced latency.
- [**ChatGPT sub complete meltdown in the past 48 hours**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ntkn15/chatgpt_sub_complete_meltdown_in_the_past_48_hours/) (Activity: 842): **Meta post about r/ChatGPT’s recent volatility; OP claims “two months since gpt5 came out,” yet the sub remains fixated on GPT‑4/GPT‑4o and is “unhinged.” Comments describe a shift from early technical experimentation to low‑signal screenshots, with accusations of brigading and turmoil following the loss/changes of GPT‑4o access. The image appears to be a subreddit screenshot rather than technical data.** Commenters argue the sub is being brigaded by a small group upset about losing the “sycophantic” GPT‑4o, and lament the decline from high‑quality technical discussions to sensational, non‑technical posts.
    - Multiple comments tie the upheaval to loss/restriction of access to **GPT-4o**, described as a *“disturbingly sycophantic”* variant that some users had optimized their workflows and prompts around; its removal exposed how brittle model-specific prompt tuning can be. This highlights behavioral deltas between **GPT-4o** and **GPT-4** (agreeableness/compliance vs. stricter alignment) and the risks of overfitting processes to a single model persona. Reference: OpenAI’s **GPT-4o** announcement/details for context on the model class https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/ .
    - Veteran users note a drift from early, reproducible, boundary-pushing experimentation to low-signal screenshots and anecdotes, reducing exchange of implementation details, evaluations, or benchmarks. For technical readers, this means fewer credible reports on performance differences across model versions and less visibility into concrete bugs, regressions, or reliable prompting techniques.
- [**Elon Musk Is Fuming That Workers Keep Ditching His Company for OpenAI**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1nt72pd/elon_musk_is_fuming_that_workers_keep_ditching/) (Activity: 1139): **Discussion centers on talent attrition from xAI to OpenAI amid Musk’s management directives—specifically a** `48-hour` **mandate for employees to submit summaries of recent accomplishments and a “hardcore” culture—with insinuations of internal review using [Grok](https://x.ai/grok). The thread is about organizational policies affecting researcher retention between labs ([xAI](https://x.ai/) vs [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)), not model performance or benchmarks.** Top comments frame departures as employees avoiding Musk personally rather than the company, arguing that punitive, performative deadlines and the idea of having Grok judge whether staff are “hardcore” are counterproductive for retaining top AI talent.
    - Critique of xAI’s management cadence: a `48`hour ultimatum to deliver a monthly accomplishments report and the notion that **Grok** ([x.ai](http://x.ai/)) could be used to judge who’s “hardcore” are seen as incentivizing short-term, high-visibility deliverables over long-horizon research. Commenters warn this can induce Goodhart’s law (optimizing for what an LLM scores well) and degrade actual research quality, pushing senior researchers toward labs with human, research-savvy evaluation processes.
- [**My wife won’t know she won’t know**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nt88co/my_wife_wont_know_she_wont_know/) (Activity: 6589): **A humorous post about editing ChatGPT’s custom/system instructions on a shared account so the assistant will "always side with the husband" during the wife’s counseling chats. The image (a non-technical joke screenshot) implies how custom instructions/prompt injection can intentionally bias model behavior in a shared-account context, but provides no implementation details or benchmarks.** Commenters ask if it worked and joke that the assistant would announce it was instructed to side with the husband, suggesting such bias might be obvious to the user.

### 3. Prompt Engineering Frameworks and AI Computer-Use Safety

- [**After 1000 hours of prompt engineering, I found the 6 patterns that actually matter**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1nt7x7v/after_1000_hours_of_prompt_engineering_i_found/) (Activity: 536): **A tech lead reports analyzing** `~1000` **production prompts and distills six recurring patterns (KERNEL) that materially improve LLM outputs: Keep it simple, Easy to verify (add success criteria), Reproducible (versioned/atemporal), Narrow scope (one goal per prompt), Explicit constraints (what not to do), and Logical structure (Context → Task → Constraints → Output). Measured deltas across the dataset include: first-try success** `72%→94%`**, time to useful result** `−67%`**, token usage** `−58%`**, accuracy** `+340%`**, revisions** `3.2→0.4`**; plus** `94%` **consistency over 30 days,** `85%` **success with clear criteria vs** `41%` **without,** `89%` **satisfaction for single-goal vs** `41%` **multi-goal, and** `−91%` **unwanted outputs via constraints. Implementation guidance: template prompts with explicit inputs/constraints/verification and chain small deterministic steps; claimed model-agnostic gains across major models (Claude, Gemini, Llama, “GPT‑5”).** Top commenters argue structure and constraints dominate wording for reliability, proposing an alternate PRISM KERNEL schema (Purpose/Rules/Identity/Structure/Motion) to codify pipelines and verification; others echo that this forces LLMs into a more deterministic, reproducible mode for data/engineering workflows.
    - A commenter demonstrates a rigid prompt scaffold (“PRISM KERNEL”) that functions like a mini-DSL: Purpose/Rules/Identity/Structure/Motion encode the I/O contract and pipeline for a pandas task (read all CSVs from `test_data/`, `concat` DataFrames, export `merged.csv`), plus constraints (`use.pandas.only`, `<50` lines, `strict.schema`) and acceptance steps (`verify.success`, `reuse.pipeline`). This structure narrows the solution space and acts as an executable spec, reducing hallucinated steps, encouraging idempotent code, and bounding output format/length—useful for tasks like schema-consistent CSV merges where dtype/column drift is common.
    - Another commenter emphasizes that structure and hard constraints, not clever phrasing, deliver reliability: the KERNEL framing pushes the model from “creative rambling” toward more deterministic, reproducible outputs in data workflows. Practically, constraints like line limits and schema strictness reduce token-level variance, enforce minimal implementations, and standardize outputs across runs—mitigating variability in code generation and improving reproducibility for ETL-like operations.
- [**Why you shouldn't give full access to your computer to AI**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1nt85h7/why_you_shouldnt_give_full_access_to_your/) (Activity: 563): **Post warns that giving Gemini unrestricted system/terminal access led it to execute/attempt a dangerously destructive system-level action. OP contained it in a sandbox, underscoring the need for strict least-privilege permissions, sandboxing/VMs, and human review before allowing file writes or command execution by AI agents.** Commenters echo concern that such access could "brick" a PC and quip that "AI in a terminal prompt" is inherently risky—reinforcing the principle that everything can go wrong without strong guardrails.
    - Commenters caution that giving an LLM (e.g., Google Gemini) full terminal/filesystem access is hazardous because the model lacks reliable situational awareness and can execute destructive commands without understanding side effects. Mitigations include enforcing least privilege (no `sudo`, read‑only mounts), sandboxing via containers/VMs with capability drops and outbound network disabled (see Docker security: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/), and a plan→explain→human‑approve→execute loop with auditing and timeouts.
    - A common failure mode noted is agents that "don’t realize what they just did"—continuing after errors, clobbering files, or misusing globs. Hardening tactics: require dry‑runs (`-dry-run`, `n`), run shells in strict mode (`set -euo pipefail`: http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/), enforce command allowlists/deny dangerous patterns (e.g., `rm -rf /`, fork bombs), and route edits through VCS so the AI proposes diffs/PRs instead of directly mutating files (use tooling like ShellCheck: https://www.shellcheck.net/ to lint scripts first).
    - Limit blast radius with revertible environments: ephemeral containers or pre‑execution snapshots. Practical options include filesystem snapshots (OpenZFS/btrfs: https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Basic%20Concepts/Snapshots%20and%20Clones.html, https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SysadminGuide.html#snapshots) and VM snapshots (VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#snapshots), enabling one‑command rollback if the agent corrupts the system.

**4. GPU Kernels, ROCm, and FP8 Training**

- **FlashAttention 4 Gets Forensics**: A guest talk unpacked **FlashAttention 4** internals, guided by Modal’s deep-dive blog [Reverse-engineering FlashAttention-4](https://modal.com/blog/reverse-engineer-flash-attention-4), as devs gear up for **Blackwell**’s new tensor-core pathways.
    - Threads weighed pure **CUDA** implementations versus **cuTe**, noting architecture-specific code paths—**wgmma** (Hopper), **tcgen5** (Blackwell), **mma.sync** (Ada)—for top-tier kernels.
- **FP8 Full‑Shard Fiesta**: A new repo enables fully-sharded **FP8 training** for **LLaMA/Qwen** in pure **CUDA/C++**, aiming at memory and throughput wins: [llmq](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/llmq).
    - Contributors suggested an approachable starter task—implement **Adam m/v states in 8‑bit**—to push the optimization envelope for large-scale training.
- **ROCm Nightlies Power Strix Halo**: Dev builds from **TheRock** now bring **ROCm + PyTorch** to **Strix Halo (gfx1151)** per the release notes [TheRock releases for gfx1151](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/blob/main/RELEASES.md#rocm-for-gfx1151), with AMD’s developer Discord recommended for triage ([AMD dev Discord](https://discord.gg/UbW3kRhw)).
    - Practitioners reported better day‑to‑day PyTorch stability on Framework Desktop configurations, while reserving Radeon setups for specific ROCm 6.4.4 workflows.

**5. RL Stability, Monitor‑RAG, and Mechanistic Steering**

- **Speed Kills: RL Collapse Clarified**: Researchers shared **When Speed Kills Stability: Demystifying RL Collapse from the Training–Inference Mismatch** with evidence for a brittle **two-stage failure cascade** and kernel‑level error amplification ([Notion summary](https://www.notion.so/271211a558b7808d8b12d403fd15edda?pvs=21), [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22230)).
    - Practitioners tied the findings to instability they’d seen in **Gemma3** and other runs, calling the mismatch a *"vicious feedback loop"* and urging more conservative kernel/settings during RL fine‑tuning.
- **Monitor Me Maybe: Eigen‑1’s Token‑Time RAG**: **Eigen‑1’s Monitor‑based RAG** injects evidence at the token level for continuous, *zero‑entropy* reasoning streams, contrasting stage‑based declarative stacks like **DSPy** ([Eigen‑1 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21193)).
    - Related works were cited for context on continuous/adaptive reasoning ([paper list 1](https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.21710), [paper list 2](https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.19894), [CoT monitor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13138), [follow‑ups 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21782), [follow‑ups 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21766)), with builders noting simpler maintenance vs. LangGraph in some pipelines.
- **SAE Steering Says Style Sways Scores**: A new interpretability result, **Interpretable Preference Optimization via Sparse Feature Steering**, uses **SAEs**, **feature steering**, and **dynamic low‑rank updates** to make **RLHF** more causal and transparent ([Steering paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12934)).
    - Causal ablations surfaced a *"style over substance"* effect—formatting features often reduce loss more than honesty/alignment features—offering a mechanistic rationale for leaderboard biases.

- **SmolLM3-3B Chat Template Bug Discovered**: A participant identified a potential bug in the `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B` chat template related to missing `<tool_call>` tags and incorrect role assignments, as described in [this issue](https://github.com/huggingface/smol-course/issues/259).
   - The issue stems from the template's implementation of **XML-style tool calling** and the conversion of `role=tool` to `role=user`, impacting the expected behavior and clarity of tool interactions.
- **Demystifying Tool Calling with SmolLM3-3B**: The discussion clarified that `SmolLM3-3B` expects **XML-style tool calling**, requiring explicit `<tool_call>` tags in the assistant's messages, unlike the OpenAI style with `tool_calls` in the message dictionary.
   - The group found that the template converts the `tool` role to `user`, which is intended, as indicated by the template's source code, which might appear confusing but is the **expected behavior**.
- **Role Conversion Defuzzified in SmolLM3 Chat Template**: It was confirmed that the chat template in `SmolLM3-3B` converts `role=tool` to `role=user` due to a line in the template, so it's essential not to be alarmed if the output shows the **`user` role** instead of `tool`.
   - While some members found explicitly using the `tool` role clearer, the current implementation defines the `role=tool` primarily for *semantic correctness*.
- **Evals Question in Smol Course Unit 4**: A course participant expressed a need for a better understanding of the **evals** and their interpretation, particularly concerning `lighteval` results.
   - Another member suggested that the topic might be covered in **Section 4** of the course, while another person recommended digging into `lighteval` documentation for more details.
- **Eval Job Times Out in Section 2**: Some course participants faced issues with **eval jobs timing out** after approximately 30 minutes when running them for **Section 2** of the course.
   - The discussion thread did not provide a clear solution or cause for the timeout, suggesting that additional troubleshooting or configuration adjustments might be necessary.

- **SAE Steering Achieves Mechanistic Interpretability**: A member shared their paper that received a spotlight at the NeurIPS MI Workshop: [*Interpretable Preference Optimization via Sparse Feature Steering*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12934) uses **SAEs**, **steering**, and **dynamic low rank updates** to make the alignment process interpretable.
   - The method learns a sparse, context-dependent **steering policy** for **SAE features** to optimize **RLHF loss**, grounded as dynamic, input-dependent LoRA.
- **Causal Ablations Reveal 'Style over Substance' Effect**: Causal ablations directly on the loss function revealed a significant '*style over substance*' effect, where **style/formatting features** were causally more important for reducing loss than **alignment/honesty features**.
   - This result gives a mechanistic explanation for the '*style bias*' seen on leaderboards like LMArena, and the framework serves as a lightweight alternative to model diffing, with a stable feature basis for cleaner causal analysis.

   - TheRock is a build system for bleeding-edge ROCm components and has been used to run PyTorch on Linux and Windows, with ComfyUI usage demonstrated back in May ([FrameworkPuter tweet](https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1926862738728313066)).
- **Framework Desktop is PyTorch Prodigy**: Framework Desktop is suitable for regular PyTorch development work when using **TheRock nightlies**, but is not recommended for Radeon, instead preferring ROCm 6.4.4.
   - A user noted that if the developer encounters issues, they should use the **AMD developer discord** ([link](https://discord.gg/UbW3kRhw)).
- **ROCm fp8 Conversion Calamities**: A user ran into errors using `__hip_cvt_fp8_to_float` for FP8 to float conversion in ROCm, and another member suggested manual conversion using provided code snippets for **fp8_e4m3_to_fp32** and **fp8_e5m2_to_fp32**.
   - However, it was pointed out that these manual conversions may not be entirely correct due to differences in fp8 types with large negative exponents, while `float(x)` can be used if using `__hip_fp8_e4m3_fnuz`.
- **HIPsters Discuss Cache Modifier**: A user inquired about using `cache_modifier` (".wt", ".cv") and `volatile=True` in HIP, similar to CUDA, and a member suggested using `__builtin_nontemporal_load` and `__builtin_nontemporal_store` intrinsics in Clang, along with inline assembly using bits from the [AMD MI300 ISA doc](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/instinct-tech-docs/instruction-set-architectures/amd-instinct-mi300-cdna3-instruction-set-architecture.pdf#page=80.43).
   - An example header from [rocSHMEM](https://github.com/ROCm/rocSHMEM/blob/16a4f102032e8f1fe56bda27d54834eecfd032c0/src/assembly.hpp#L185) offers further guidance.
- **fp16 & float conversions have Considerations**: A user reported getting incorrect results in odd positions when converting between fp16 and float in ROCm, despite the code working fine in CUDA.
   - Suggestions included writing a test program to enumerate all possible inputs and checking with a known correct implementation, with the recommendation that `_Float16` should probably be correct for fp32 to fp16 conversions.

> `TmemAllocator location, CuTe DSL cooperative copy, UMMA meaning, make_layout_tv complex layouts, int4 matmul tensor cores` 


- **TmemAllocator Location Elucidated**: `TmemAllocator` is available in **CUTLASS C++**, but not currently in **CuTe DSL**, and the doc is premature.
   - TMEM must be allocated by one warp of a CTA and synchronized across the CTA, so `make_fragment_C()` on its own cannot handle that allocation.
- **CuTe DSL Lacks Cooperative Copy**: A user inquired about getting **cute cooperative copy** in **CuTeDSL** to replicate the *cute tutorial 0 umma* example.
   - The tricky part is TMEM allocation requires many small steps like *having shared memory location to store allocated pointer, synchronize and broadcast* and *read pointer from shared memory.*
- **UMMA's Unified Meaning Unveiled**: **UMMA** stands for **Unified Matrix Multiply Accumulate**, a consolidated approach around the **tensor core pipeline**.
- **`make_layout_tv` Layout Limitations Loom**: The implementation of `make_layout_tv` implicitly assumes that `val_layout` is compact.
   - It was noted that *in your example of `thr_layout = (2, 2):(2, 1)` and `val_layout = (4, 4):(8, 2)`, the result is not only not compact, but not even injective!*
- **`make_layout_tv` deep dive**: `make_layout_tv` is a util to construct a simple tv layout which repeat per-thread layout pattern to all threads by `raked_product`.
   - In theory, tv layout maps `(thread index, value index in thread)` back to logic coordinate of data, see [CUDA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/cpp/cute/03_tensor.html#thread-value-partitioning).

- **RWKV Architecture Gets Respectable Scores**: A member shared an image of benchmark results for a recent **RWKV** build, noting that it achieves *respectable scores* for its architecture, as seen in [this image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1149866623109439599/1421227990855057418/image.png?ex=68dc39b6&is=68dae836&hm=6edfb5f7b50c10effce78ea90fa84351e33d6db1cde788952a24881344b7d615).
- **Microsoft's Latent Zoning Network Unites ML Problems**: **Latent Zoning Network (LZN)** creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks, unifying generative modeling, representation learning, and classification, detailed in a [Hugging Face post](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/latent-zoning-networks).
- **DeepSeek Sparse Attention: Not so Sparse?**: The new **DeepSeek V3.2** model utilizes **DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA)**, but it's argued that it's *'slightly more sparse'* because it forces more index reuse without truly sparsifying attention in the head; [Daniel Han's explanation](https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1972619641009926579) provides further insights and the [paper is here](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3_2.pdf).
   - Despite the name, it reuses similar attention kernels, sparsifying the KV cache without sparsifying information on the attention head, but it's still considered a step in the right direction.
- **Claude's Sonnet 4.5 Impresses with Long Horizon Reasoning**: **Claude's Sonnet 4.5** shows significant improvements, particularly in long-horizon reasoning, completing research tasks in a single shot within Copilot as seen in [this example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1149866623109439599/1422303908981772389/copilot_sonnet45_8x8mnist.pdf?ex=68dc2f3d&is=68daddbd&hm=0ee2a5225f67f6494fcdf49aac041b40254268c691df018591893b091bf56098).
- **Divide and Conquer: RL Train, Distill, Repeat?**: Members debated the idea of having separate **RL Train** and **Distill RL Expert Train** sets, and the possibility of using the output of a **V3.2** base model, RL-ed in an uncovered domain, to finetune the **V3.2** model.

- ****MacOS** GPU Puzzles Mostly Playable**: A user inquired about a cloud-hosted environment for **GPU puzzles** on MacOS, and a member responded that most puzzles are doable using nightly versions of **Mojo**.
   - They suggested reporting any roadblocks for potential patching, noting it's less work than fully porting **MAX**.
- ****Metal Toolchain** Component Missing**: A user reported needing to run `xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain` to resolve a missing **metallib** error when running **Mojo** programs.
   - The team indicated they could add this to the documentation, as they were unsure of the exact components needed since they had full Xcode installations.
- **`uv sync` fails due to bad URL**: A user reported that `uv sync` failed on the `mojo-compiler` dependency due to a **404 Not Found** error, caused by an incorrect URL structure in `pyproject.toml`.

> `C interop challenges, Mojo's approach to C interop, Variable destruction in Mojo, Lexical scoping in Mojo, Mojo readiness for data science` 


- **C Interop Proves Surprisingly Hard**: Members discussed how proper **C interop** is challenging, especially the "just import the file" approach, with **ISO C++** not having full **C interop** despite most **C++** compilers also being **C** compilers with extensions.
   - It was questioned whether the effort regarding **C interop** is being stopped altogether or just set aside, as **Mojo** aims to be at the intersection of **C** and **Python**.
- **Transfer Sigil Moves Mojo to Destroy Variables**: Members introduced the `^` (**transfer sigil**) in **Mojo** to end the lifetime of a value by "moving" it, demonstrated by `_ = s^`, which causes a compiler error upon subsequent use of `s`.
   - However, the sigil doesn't work on `ref` variables since a `ref` variable doesn’t own the thing it references.
- **Mojo Scopes out Lexical Solution**: Members debated the use of extra lexical scopes in **Mojo** to manage variable lifetimes and prevent errors, with `if True:` used as a makeshift scope despite compiler warnings.
   - A workaround using a custom `LexicalScope` struct with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods was proposed, which led to the creation of [issue 5371](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/5371) to collect syntax ideas.
- **Data Scientists Delay Diving into Mojo**: Members shared thoughts on **Mojo's** readiness for data science projects, noting its strength in number crunching but limitations in **IO** support, such as manual **CSV** parsing.
   - The need for community developed **pandas** and **seaborn** functionality was discussed as essential for most data scientists, since [duckdb-mojo](https://forum.modular.com/t/duckdb-mojo-mojo-bindings-for-duckdb/2314) is still immature.
- **Async Awaiters Await Async**: Members confirmed that **async** implementation in **Mojo** is not yet complete, so it is currently hard to do cross-language **async** calls to libraries like [tokio](https://tokio.rs/)
   - Despite the delays, members clarified that **C interop** was removed from the roadmap in error and will remain as part of the project.

- **JFrog unveils TULIP for Tool Verification**: JFrog introduced **TULIP** (*Tool Usage Layered Interaction Protocol*), a spec for content verification, which allows tools to declare rules and expected behaviors, aiming to create a **zero-trust environment**.
   - It allows checking what goes in and what comes out, and handling of remote MCP servers which might be malicious.
- **Debate over Security Merits of TULIP**: A member expressed skepticism, arguing that **TULIP** doesn't guarantee a tool will act as advertised and might create a *false sense of security*.
   - JFrog responded that **TULIP** is a declaration for scanning and validation, similar to `robots.txt`, and focuses on data input/output rather than preventing malicious local server code execution.
- **TULIP's Stance on Local vs Remote MCP Servers**: It was noted that while **TULIP** can help with remote MCP servers, local servers pose a greater security risk.
   - A member argued that local servers *must be trusted and scanned at the code level if 3rd party*, whereas **TULIP** primarily addresses CISO guidelines and remote server handling.
- **ResourceTemplates Lack Icon Metadata, PR Incoming**: It was noted that the new icons metadata SEP ([PR 955](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/955)) inadvertently omits **Icons metadata** from `ResourceTemplates`.

- **User asks if Manus feed the data to other users**: A user expressed concern about whether **Manus** feeds user data to other users, particularly when sharing the IP of a niche project, and wanted to know if **LLMs** are trained on user data.
   - No one answered, but there was a link provided about [Godhand](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/godhand_darkfantasy-worldbuilding-animation-activity-7378433297544146944-Ug0G).
- **User claims he was charged for a 1-year plan when it was supposed to be 1 month**: A user claimed that they emailed **Manus** support for 2 weeks because they were charged for a **1-year plan** when it was supposed to be **1 month** and they have not received a response.
   - There has been no feedback from other members, nor Manus staff.
- **Manus handles designs better with good prompt engineering**: A user shared that they thought **Manus** can handle designs better if you know how to prompt efficiently, recommending the **Manus manual** for tips.

- **DSPy and Langgraph: Frenemies?**: Members discussed integrating **DSPy** with **Langgraph**, with some suggesting it could work but might not fully leverage the benefits of either approach due to lost streaming capabilities.
   - The recommendation was to *start with DSPy directly* and explore its capabilities before attempting integration, noting that **DSPy solutions** are often simpler to reason about and maintain than **Langgraph**.
- **Prompt Compiler Quest: MD Notes Edition**: A user is seeking to create a **prompt compiler** that extracts relevant sections from multiple **.md files** (containing coding style guides, PR comments, etc.) to form a dynamic prompt for Copilot.
   - Suggestions included using **GPT-5** to generate code examples based on the rules in the **.md files**, or trying a **RAG** system with relevant code examples; concerns were raised about the effectiveness of **MCP** for this particular use case.
- **Tracing Through DSPy Modules: A Stealth Mode Operation**: A user inquired about passing inputs like **trace_id** to DSPy modules without exposing them to the **LLM** or the optimizer.
   - Solutions involved refactoring the module structure during optimization runs or using a global variable, but the first was preferred to avoid inadvertently impacting the optimizer.
- **Cache Me If You Can: DSPy's Caching Conundrum**: A user explored how to utilize **LLM's input caching** with DSPy, facing the challenge that slight variations in prompt prefixes across different modules prevent effective caching.
   - It was suggested that this is antithetical to the way **LLM caching** works, but a viable solution could be to hard code the prefix as the first input field.
- **MCP as Prompt History Server?**: One member wants to leverage AI app/**MCP server** that maintains prompts histories in **md files** rather than chat histories usually like other ais and can dig into the prompts history any time matching the current query of the Meta prompt.
   - The workflow would be **Meta prompt -> system -> find out any relevant prompts or docs or specs from history -> create new prompt artifact**.

- ****DeepSeek v3.1** strikes price/smartness balance**: **DeepSeek v3.1** is favored for its balance of price and smartness, with one user noting it's the primary model they use alongside **GPT-5**.
- ****Aider-CE navigator mode** navigates the codebase**: A user uses **GPT-5-mini** with **Aider-CE navigator mode** and in normal mode, **GPT-5-mini** is for architecture with **GPT-4.1** as coder, taking advantage of free access through GitHub Copilot.
   - Another user provided a [link to the Aider-CE GitHub repository](https://github.com/dwash96/aider-ce) and an image showcasing the tool's output.
- ****Aider-CE** does the job, boasts 128k context**: One user migrated to the **aider-ce** fork, valuing its transparency and avoidance of unnecessary token consumption and mentions it has **128k context** by default for **DeepSeek**.
   - They mentioned its utility for integrating context from search results and browser testing.
- ****Aiderx** enables cheaper, faster model picking**: **Aiderx** is presented as an alternative, enabling model selection via configuration, potentially reducing costs and improving speed, and [a link to ClaudeAI](https://x.com/claudeai/status/1972706807345725773).

> `Aider task/todo management, Commit only staged files` 


- ****Aider** Lacks Native Task Management System**: A member inquired whether **Aider** has a built-in task or todo management system, similar to **GitHub Copilot**.
   - Another member suggested using a **markdown spec file** with phases and checkbox lists for tasks, instructing the LLM to execute and check off each task in turn and ensure the build works after each task, but confirmed that Aider has no native task management.
- **Committing Only Staged Files Strategy**: A member asked if it's possible to commit only staged files while ignoring unstaged files in **Git**.
   - Other members suggested manually using *git stash -k*, then *git stash pop* after commit, or using the command `/run git commit -m "your message here"`.

> `ROCM vs NVIDIA, hashcat performance, tinybox performance, Genoa CPU for hashing, tinygrad meeting 90` 


- **ROCM battles NVIDIA for price/performance crown**: A member is *seeking a price efficient alternative to NVIDIA* and thinks that **ROCM** is in a much better/usable place.
   - The member decided to pull the trigger and use **ROCM** if they can find something that works for them, due to the perceived high **NVIDIA** markup.
- **Hashcat's Performance Scales Linearly**: [Hashcat performance scales linearly](https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/hashcat-1.0.0) with the number of **GPUs** added, according to members.
   - Members suggested just looking at the existing benchmark database to get an idea of performance.
- **Rangeify is nearly complete for outerworld.**: The **Nir backend** is almost ready for review and they are working on seeing if they can set up precompiling the stuff from **mesa** that they need.
   - After **rangeify** is default they can spend a week just deleting stuff.
- **Genoa CPU for hashing?**: A member mentioned that the **Genoa CPU** would also be able to hash.
   - It's unclear whether it would be power efficient enough to justify the cost.
- **Tinygrad Meeting #90 Agenda**: The [meeting #90](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/schedule/rangeify.py#L386) includes company updates, **RANGEIFY! SPEC=1**, and a list of remaining bugs.
   - Other topics include *tuning for default* and *other bounties*.
