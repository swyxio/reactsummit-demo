**CUDA MODE ▷ #[torch](https://discord.com/channels/1189498204333543425/1189607750876008468/1235563374348341288)** (43 messages🔥): 

- **PyTorch PR Pains**: A contributor, **kashimoo**, expresses frustration with the slow build times of linear algebra components in PyTorch and a separate PR that was reverted due to issues with Meta's internal builds. **chhillee** confirms that such setbacks are common due to PyTorch’s "github first" policy and offers to connect **kashimoo** with more knowledgeable contributors on the Slack channel.

- **Debugging Symbols for PyTorch Development**: **kashimoo** inquires about building specific directories with debugging symbols to facilitate the use of gdb. While **chhillee** suggests using an available script on the [PyTorch development forum](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/how-to-get-a-fast-debug-build/1597), **kashimoo** thinks it might not be enough for their purposes.

- **Dynamic Compilation Challenges in PyTorch**: **benjamin_w** reports issues when using `dynamic=True` with `torch.compile(...)` in conjunction with Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) in PyTorch 2.3. While the approach worked in PyTorch 2.2.2, it appears to lead to recompilation for each batch in version 2.3. **marksaroufim** advises against using `dynamic=True` and suggests manually marking sequence lengths as dynamic instead.

- **Improving Issue Triage on CUDA MODE Discord**: **marksaroufim** and others discuss ways to handle the growing number of issues on the server, proposing the idea of a bot that parses and automatically files issues on GitHub, with **jamesmel** offering to implement the bot. It's decided to open issues in cuda mode for now to manage the influx.

- **Torch Compile Optimization for Variable Lengths**: Troubleshooting continues as **benjamin_w** struggles with `ConstraintViolationError` when using `torch._dynamo.mark_dynamic(inputs, index=1)` on PyTorch 2.2 & 2.3 for dynamic sequence lengths. They prefer persistent model compilation over multiple batches, but encounter brittle behavior. **marksaroufim** suggests that creating a GitHub issue would be best for resolving the issue.

- **CUDA and Memory Optimization Discussions**: The team achieved **167K tokens/second**, outperforming PyTorch's 150K tok/s, by optimizing CUDA kernels and introducing changes like CUDA streams and fused classifiers. They're discussing the impact of **bias kernel optimizations** and potential **next steps** for further gains. See the related [discussion and pull request](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/344).
  
- **Scratch Buffers and Atom Variables**: They've introduced scratch buffers to handle atom variables more efficiently. The usage of fp32 atomics on a scratch buffer and then a read and round/write to bf16 is suggested to avoid slow fp32 atomics in global memory.

- **Profiling Script Updates**: Updates have been made to the profiling script, improving robustness against CUDA library updates and separating NVIDIA kernel times from llm.c kernel times. The script changes are tracked in [this pull request](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/342).

- **PyTorch Padding**: There is a debate on whether padding PyTorch's vocabulary size is fair for performance comparison, with acknowledgment that it's not straightforward and involves ensuring that padded dimensions are not used in the loss or during sampling.

- **Layernorm and Residual Calculations**: The conversation touched upon **saving variance and mean of layernorm in fp32** for stability and performance benefits, although it hasn't been implemented in llm.c due to code simplicity and the bf16 type used for activations.

- **CHERI Blossoming into Daily Use**: Chats highlight that the **Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI)** offers considerable promise in improving hardware security, with potential to nullify 70% of current vulnerability exploits. The discussion was spurred by a recent [conference playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55r1-RCAaGU6fU2o34pwlb6ytWqkuzoi) that delves into the advancements within the CHERI ecosystem.

- **A Paradigm Shift in Software Development**: With the adoption of CHERI, software development could see a seismic shift, as processes could become orders of magnitude faster, resulting in efficient UNIX-style programming with high performance. This potentiality is discussed in the context of [CHERI facilitating lightning-fast IPC](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheripedia/wiki/Colocation-Tutorial) and the inherent benefits of such capabilities.

- **Sandboxes Entering the Fast Lane**: The conversation moved towards how CHERI's *scalable compartmentalization* could fundamentally change environments that utilize sandboxes, impacting web browsers, virtual machines, and even edge computing. A [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/_QxXiTv1hH0?t=933) was referenced, illustrating this transformative tech.

- **Potential Redundancy of Traditional Security Measures**: Speculation abounds that with the rise of CHERI, traditional hardware security like MMU-based memory protection or address space layout randomization might become obsolete, thereby simplifying hardware design and enhancing software speed.

- **Microkernels Could Take Center Stage**: One member pondered if CHERI could precipitate a revolution in OS development, where the traditionally high cost of IPC in microkernels is countered, making them a potentially dominant architecture.

- **Mojo Reference Semantics Still in Flux**: Mojo's semantics for references and lifetimes are being actively designed to offer **simpler yet flexible** structures than the existing prototype. A design will be shared publicly, and there is an ongoing debate on whether the semantics of reference and lifetime is nearly complete or will continue to have layers added on top.
- **Crash Reports and Bug Tracking**: Discussions point to a [crash report and a bug](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/2429) related to `struct lifetime` that requires attention. Concerns are raised over compiler crashes that should instead provide meaningful error messages.
- **InlineArray Intrigues and Issues**: `InlineArray` is not yet on stable build; despite its utility, there are known quirks with large arrays and related GitHub issues indicate it's awaiting more stability. The feature is implemented in `utils.InlineArray`.
- **Debating Mojo's GPU Support**: Mojo is anticipated to soon have GPU support, starting with Nvidia, leveraging MLIR for versatility across platforms. Meanwhile, discussions clarify that it's a multi-year effort for existing languages to move from LLVM to MLIR, making Mojo's inherent MLIR integration special.
- **Interest in Snap Package and I/O Functions**: There is a request for an official Snap package on the Snap Store for Ubuntu and discussion on the current state of Mojo’s I/O module being basic, necessitating imports from Python for simple user input functionality like reading from `stdin`.

- **Intriguing Trends in Multilingual LLMs**: An ongoing discussion revolves around how to enhance multilingual capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), with references made to research papers such as ["Understanding Language Models by Fine-grained Language Identification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588) and work exploring LLMs' processing of multilingual inputs. The framework depicted suggests that in initial layers, LLMs convert multilingual inputs into English before generating responses in the original query's language.

- **Reflecting on the Journey of ML Domains**: Users reminisced about abandoned or overshadowed research areas in machine learning, including adversarial robustness, automated architecture, and domain-specific model training. There's a feeling of nostalgia and a hint of regret for the paths not taken, exacerbated by the fact that job pull by major tech companies has deprioritized these areas.

- **The Changing Landscape of AI Funding and Impact**: Users discussed the enormous investments in AI companies and the potential over-saturation leading to diminishing returns on investment. Concerns are raised about how this affects the efficiency of scaling up models and the future direction of AI research.

- **LLMs and System Hierarchy Vulnerabilities**: There's an intricate conversation on how models handle instruction hierarchies and the vulnerabilities that arise when a system prompt is not considered different from a user prompt—a risk particularly important in preventing prompt injections or other attacks on LLMs. A linked paper, ["Improving Robustness to Prompt Injections with Instruction Hierarchy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13208), suggests reinforcing instruction hierarchies could mitigate these vulnerabilities.

- **Job Search for an ML Engineer**: A member is reaching out to the community seeking opportunities for a machine learning engineer position outside the US.

- **Exploring the Depths of Dataset Contamination**: Amidst discussions about instruction-finetuning and benchmark effectiveness, participants shared concerns over benchmark dataset leakage in large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the difficulty in measuring leaked information and the cycle of detecting and addressing leaks. Two recent papers on benchmark dataset leakage were highlighted: one focused on [detecting data leakages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18824) and the other discussing [fresh benchmark questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00332) as a solution to prevent unfair comparisons.
  
- **Chatbot Conversations as a Learning Tool**: The idea of using chatbot conversations, particularly those with multiple multiturn interactions with the same user, was contemplated with the notion of utilizing sentiment analysis or user retention (churn) to improve an LLM. Participants were curious about how these could lead to a self-improvement loop within the model, with one member pointing out a [paper focusing on indirect preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15269) and another reference to the [WildChat dataset for chatbot research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01470).
  
- **Chess Mastery without Heuristics**: A study using a transformer model trained on a dataset of 10 million chess games was brought up, demonstrating the model's high performance in chess without domain-specific enhancements or explicit search algorithms. The [DeepMind paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04494) indicates that training models at scale can lead to competitive levels of play without the approaches traditional chess engines use.

- **Serendipitous Time Travels and Future Returns**: A humorous exchange took place where a participant jokingly claimed to have built a time machine and returned from the future, leading to playful interactions about their presence in the 'ot' (off-topic) channel and the utilization of a time machine.

- **Gwern's Peripheral Return**: In a meta-discussion, participants noted gwern1782's selective responses to past mentions after a period of absence from the server, with mentions of using Discord's search feature to filter through the multitude of notifications.

- **DeepSpeed Stage 3 Quality Concerns Cleared**: DeepSpeed Stage 3, also known as ZeRO-3, does not inherently degrade model quality but optimizes memory usage during training. It's essential to correctly implement and integrate ZeRO-3 within the training pipeline to avoid potential issues due to misconfigurations. [DeepSpeed documentation](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/tree/main/docs/source/usage_guides/deepspeed.md#L83L167) can guide configuration.
  
- **Flash Attention with DeepSpeed for Fine-Tuning**: It is possible to use both Flash Attention and DeepSpeed Stage 3 for fine-tuning models, requiring integration of Flash Attention into the model and DeepSpeed Stage 3 setup within the training script. Proper configuration is crucial to leverage both technologies effectively.

- **Speed Improvements with DeepSpeed Stage 3**: DeepSpeed Stage 3 can speed up very large model training, allowing for larger batch sizes and reducing the need for complex parallelism strategies. However, the extent of speedup can vary based on model architecture, hardware setup, and data loading efficiency.

- **Training with LLaMA 3 Instruct on Axolotl**: Instructions for training with LLaMA 3 Instruct involve setting up an environment, creating a YAML config file, and initiating training and inference through commands using Accelerate and Axolotl. Adjustments specific to LLaMA 3 Instruct's implementation may be required. [Axolotl GitHub](https://github.com/openaccess-ai-collective/axolotl)

- **Understanding VRAM Usage with Axolotl Configurations**: Utilizing the simple `qlora.yaml` config in Axolotl examples uses both GPUs equally, but transitioning to FSDP or DeepSpeed Stage 3 might not show significant VRAM reduction due to various factors including model compatibility and overhead in managing sharded models. Configurations may need fine-tuning to optimize memory savings.

- **LLaMA Quantization Quandary**: A Discord member highlighted a [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cetn9z/quantization_seems_to_hurt_the_quality_of_llama_3/) discussing the impact of quantization on **LLaMA 3's** quality compared to LLaMA 2. They linked to an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14047) detailing the performance degradation with low-bit quantization, raising questions about post-training quantization methods.
- **Quantization Loses Details**: A member expressed that the significant quantization of **Meta's LLaMA** which ignores the *chinchilla scaling law* and uses 15T tokens, could be the reason for major information loss, affecting performance. This suggests a greater risk of degradation with enhanced precision reduction in larger models.
