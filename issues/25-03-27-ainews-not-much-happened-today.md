> `Gemini 2.5 Pro Pricing and Access, Windsurf vs. Cursor: Pros and Cons, Context Window Limitations, Model Performance and Preferences, Workflow Strategies` 


- **Cursor Faces Rate Limits with Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Users are encountering very small rate limits with **Gemini 2.5 Pro** in Cursor, with one user reporting only *two API requests* before hitting the limit.
   - A member mentioned using a combination of **Gemini API**, **Requesty**, and **Open Router** to circumvent these limitations, while another suggested that **Google Workspace Business** accounts might offer increased limits via a direct line to a representative.
- **Windsurf and Cursor Face-Off**: Members continue to debate the merits of **Windsurf** versus **Cursor**, with some favoring **Windsurf** for prototyping due to its claimed *full context* and others preferring **Cursor** for bug fixing.
   - A user noted that **Windsurf's** UI styling was inconsistent compared to **Cursor's**, which maintains a consistent aesthetic across pages, while another called for the "official shitsurf shill" to be hired.
- **Context Window Size Limited by Cursor?**: A user inquired if **Cursor** limits the context window for **Gemini 2.5 Pro** to 30K, despite the model's advertised 1M context limit.
   - Later, it was clarified that while agentic models have a 60k context window, **Claude 3.7** has a 120k context window, or even 200k if max settings are enabled, though not enough data to tell is it's Vertex.
- **The Perplexing Pricing Puzzle of Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Users voiced concerns over **Cursor's** charging for **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, which is allegedly free through **Google's AI Studio API**, leading to accusations of dishonesty.
   - A **Cursor** representative clarified that the charges are to cover the capacity required to handle the model's usage, as **Google** is not offering a free tier at **Cursor's** scale and the price of the mode mirrors Gemini 2.0 Pro.
- **New Workflows Emerge: Goodbye Cursor, Hello Cline?**: Users are experimenting with new coding workflows, some of whom intend to move away from **Cursor** in favor of **VSCode** with **Cline** for coding (with **Gemini**) and **DeepSeek v3** from **Fireworks** for planning.
   - While expressing nostalgia for **Cursor's Tab** feature and a general decline for most models, but still recognizing the usefulness of the said models, one user voiced the opinion that *local models all suck at the RTX 4090 level anyway*.

> `Unsloth Dynamic 4-bit Quantization, Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B in Unsloth, GRPO research, TTS fine-tuning, Llama 3.2 vision` 


- **Unsloth's New Dynamic Quantization is Selectively Quantized**: Unsloth's [Dynamic Quants](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/tutorial-how-to-run-deepseek-v3-0324-locally) are selectively quantized, greatly improving accuracy over standard bits.
   - Unsloth released **DeepSeek-V3-0324 GGUFs**, including 1-4-bit Dynamic versions, for running the model in *llama.cpp*, LMStudio, and Open WebUI, and provides [a guide](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/tutorial-how-to-run-deepseek-v3-0324-locally) for detailed instructions on running them.
- **TTS Finetuning and emotional cues with Unsloth Notebook released**: Unsloth released the **Orpheus TTS notebook** that delivers human-like speech with emotional cues and allows users to customize voices + dialogue faster with less VRAM.
   - One of the members said that it supports *single stage models* -> pretty much llm text token in -> audio token out and added that **Kokoro won't be finetuneable at all**.
- **Details on how to train an LLM that generate voices with classified emotions**: Members are using **scribe v1 from 11labs** that *does audio event classification* to extract transcribed voice lines with emotion from a dataset of **40k hours audio** in order to train an Orpheus model.
   - The goal is *prose/speed/spacing in a given mood* and a member stated *the official orpheus was trained on 8096 ctx so you can go as high as 5-10 min*.
- **LLMs playing turn based strategy games**: Members discussed the possibility of finetuning an LLM to play a complicated turn based game like chess but with x1000 more complexity.
   - One of the members replied *you fooling your self if you think you can get that reliable with so many permutations / rules*, and recommended to check [y-haidar/awbw-research](https://github.com/y-haidar/awbw-research).

- **Gemma3 Finetuning Frustrations**: A user encountered a `ValueError` when trying to load a finetuned **Gemma3** model from disk, related to missing `bitsandbytes` components, as discussed in [GitHub issue #638](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/638).
   - The user provided a minimal example showcasing the issue with saving and loading the **Gemma3** model.
- **Qwen2.5VL-7B fine-tuning changes**: A user shared their changes to the **GRPOTrainer** for fine-tuning **Qwen2.5VL-7B**, pointing to a specific [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/1179035537009545276/1179777624986357780/1354452423296422079).
   - The user questioned whether Unsloth's implementation could provide better memory improvements compared to their own changes.
- **LoRA fine-tuning unlocks Llama 3**: A blog post was shared discussing how **LoRA** reduces the amount of parameters modified during fine-tuning which makes finetuning **Llama 3 8B** feasible.
   - The Neptune AI blog post can be found [here](https://neptune.ai/blog/fine-tuning-llama-3-with-lora).
- **Instruct Models: To Pretrain or Not To Pretrain?**: A user was advised *not to continually pretrain an instruct model* because it can degrade performance and is generally intended for adding new domain knowledge.
   - Instead, the member was encouraged to explore Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) instead for Q&A tasks, referencing the [Unsloth documentation](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/beginner-start-here/what-model-should-i-use#should-i-choose-instruct-or-base).
- **Llama 3's Batched Token Troubles**: A user reported that **Llama 3 8B** returns different tokens for the same input when using batched inputs, and traced the issue back to a regression in the `2025.3.4` release.
   - The user confirmed that `2025.3.3` works as expected.

> `ByteDance training policy, Dr GRPO paper, Catastrophic overtraining, Low precision training, Nvidia pruning paper` 


- ****DAPO**: ByteDance's Open-Source RL System Sparks Interest!**: Members shared a link to [ByteDance's Open-Source RL System **DAPO**](https://github.com/BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO), noting it *"seemed like it kind of went under the radar"*.
   - The system comes from ByteDance Seed and Tsinghua AIR.
- **Reasoning Lengths Influence Model Performance**: Discussion arose around the idea that a *"steady increase in response length allows for greater exploration"*, improving the model's reasoning and training, citing the [Dr GRPO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19206).
   - It was theorized that penalizing against too many thinking tokens for wrong answers might *"cut off the search space"*.
- **Catastrophic Overtraining: More Pre-training, More Problems?**: The paper *"[Catastrophic Overtraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19206)"* suggests that extended pre-training can degrade fine-tuning performance, terming this effect *"catastrophic overtraining."*
   - One member suggested that if an LLM is very tightly fit to one probability distribution (the pre training data) and then you try to shift it to a second distribution (the instruct data) it won't go well.
- **Pruning and Layer Addition: Nvidia's Strategy for Fine-Tuning?**: Nvidia presented a pruning paper which can be found [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62348/), as mentioned by a member. 
   - Pruning parameters irrelevant to a given task, then adding new layers to compensate for lost bulk, and continuing training, could strike a balance between plasticity and pre-training gains, as described by another member.
- ****KB-LaM**: Microsoft's Plug-and-Play External Knowledge!**: A member shared a link to Microsoft's **KB-LaM** (*Knowledge Base Language Model*) [introducing plug-and-play external knowledge to LLMs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-kblam-bringing-plug-and-play-external-knowledge-to-llms/).
   - Unlike fine-tuning or RAG, **KB-LaM** integrates external knowledge without costly retraining or complex retrieval modules.

> `Gemini 2.5 Pro, Rate Limits with Gemini 2.5 Pro, Model Context Protocol (MCP), OpenAI's GPT-4o Update, Aider's New /context Command` 


- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Faces Demand Surge, Rate Limits To Rise**: The Google team is prioritizing raising rate limits for **Gemini 2.5 Pro** due to high demand ([@OfficialLoganK Tweet](https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1905298490865160410)).
   - One user notes *Google LLMs have been buttcheeks for coding forever, give us something!*
- **OpenRouter Offers Gemini 2.5 Pro Optimization Tactics**: To bypass rate limits, [OpenRouter suggests](https://x.com/OpenRouterAI/status/1905300582505624022) adding an **AI Studio API key** and setting up OpenRouter, using it as a *surge protector*.
   - Another member noted their free tier quantized version of deepseek is rather *stupid* and verbose.
- **Gemini 2.5 Demolishes Claude 3.7's Coding Capabilities**: Users on Reddit report that **Gemini 2.5** fixed Claude's 3.7's atrocious code with one prompt.
   - Another member reports Gemini 2.5 *has just blasted my refactoring project, absolutely incomparable to Sonnet.*
- **OpenAI's GPT-4o Gets A Boost**: **GPT-4o** received an update in **ChatGPT** featuring improved instruction following, technical problem solving, intuition, and creativity ([OpenAI Tweet](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1905331956856050135)).
   - It now ranks #2 on the [Arena Leaderboard](https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1905340075225043057), surpassing **GPT-4.5**, tying #1 in Coding and Hard Prompts.
- **Aider's /context Command Expedites Codebase Navigation**: Aider's new `/context` command automatically identifies and adds relevant files for a given request, streamlining the coding process, however it is half baked and in testing.

- **Gemma 3 T/S on 9070XT**: A member with a newly acquired **9070XT** achieved **54 t/s** using **Gemma3 - 12b Q4_K_M** (Vulkan, no flash attention).
   - They noted their **7800XT** only generated around **35 t/s** with Vulkan and **39 t/s** with ROCm.
- **Gemma 3's Memory Appetite**: Members discussed how **Gemma3** models can spill into shared memory even with full offload, and how context can fill 32 GB of shared memory.
   - Someone asked *so one can load model as large as 48+gb (24 VRAM+32 Shared RAM)?* and then followed up saying that even though part of total memory will be in VRAM, *it still will work as mostly RAM inference*.
- **P100: E-Waste or Bargain Find?**: A member inquired about a **P100 16GB** as a hobby investment at **400 CAD/200 USD**.
   - Another member strongly advised against it, labeling it basically *e-waste* due to its Tesla architecture, unsupported CUDA versions, and inferior performance compared to modern cards like the **6750XT**.
- **Nemo 12B causes crashes**: A member reported that any models based on **Nemo 12B** just crashes and doesn't load.
   - The same member stated they are not sure whether they have motherboard issues related to this problem.
- **Backyard AI Program is a Remedy**: A member made progress, indicating that the **Backyard AI** program seems to load the model in correctly.
   - The member suggested trying **Backyard AI** for other members that haven't resolved loading issues.

> `Deepseek V3 on Mac Studios vs. Cloud Instances, ICLR 2025 Meetup, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B Audio Testing, Qwen 32B Model Evaluation with LLM Harness, Transformers Library Errors` 


- **Deepseek V3 Runs on Mac, Cloud?**: Members discussed running **Deepseek V3** on **Mac Studios** and the possibility of using high RAM cloud instances as a cheaper alternative to GPUs, noting a user getting **20toks/second** on a Mac Studio.
   - Someone pointed to [this article](https://digitalspaceport.com/how-to-run-deepseek-r1-671b-fully-locally-on-2000-epyc-rig/) where they observed only **4 tokens/sec** on an **AMD EPYC Rome** system, possibly due to the Mac's faster unified RAM.
- **EleutherAI Planning ICLR 2025 Meetup**: A member inquired about an **ICLR thread** and suggested seeking sponsors for a meetup if attendance numbers were promising.
   - Another member estimated around **30** attendees for **EAI and friends**.
- **Voice Sample Test for Qwen 2.5 Omni**: A member asked for someone to test the **Chelsie voice** and post an audio sample using **Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B** with audio output enabled as described [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B).
   - The code snippet provided was ```model = Qwen2_5OmniModel.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B", torch_dtype="auto", device_map="auto", enable_audio_output=True,)```
- **LLM Harness struggles with Qwen 32B**: A member reported issues evaluating the **Qwen 32B** model on **LLM harness**, despite having the latest version of Transformers.
   - The consensus was that the sharded model may have more than **10 shards**, related to **tied embeddings**, and that the transformers library could be the cause.
- **Transformers Library Blamed for Error Messages**: A member traced an issue back to transformers `4.50.2`, sharing a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1W1yMQfIY5365IB8b1as3SiD2EIxhtrex?usp=sharing) using version `4.50.0` where the issue was not present.
   - The error message was misleading and stemmed from a lack of storage, even though the error message suggested the issue was with the `AutoModel` loading function, and there was a suggestion to submit a PR to lm-eval to add better error handling.

> `Catastrophic Overtraining, OLMo-1B instruction-tuned model, Gemma Team` 


- **LLMs face Catastrophic Overtraining**: A new [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19206) challenges the assumption that better pre-training performance translates to improved downstream models, coining the term **catastrophic overtraining**.
   - The paper suggests that extended pre-training can make models harder to fine-tune, leading to degraded final performance due to a systematic increase in the broad sensitivity of pre-trained parameters to modifications.
- **OLMo-1B Suffers from Catastrophic Overtraining**: The instruction-tuned **OLMo-1B** model pre-trained on **3T tokens** leads to over **2%** worse performance on multiple standard LLM benchmarks than its **2.3T token** counterpart, according to a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19206).
- **Gemma Team Publishes New Paper**: The **Gemma Team** has published a new [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19786) with authors including Aishwarya Kamath, Johan Ferret, and Shreya Pathak.

> `privileged basis, neural networks and fixed mechanisms, CoT for reward hacking, manifold manipulation` 


- **Privileged Basis gets Deconstructed**: Members discussed the concept of a "privileged basis", which refers to directions in data that *retain more information* after nonlinear transformations, but one member called it **ill-defined**, questioning the assumptions behind its usefulness.
   - They asked, *privileged by whom?*, further questioning the assumptions that the points are uniformly distributed on the unit ball first, and that each point has the same "information content" to start out with too.
- **Neural Networks lack Organs**: One member argued against the concept of **mech interp**, asserting that neural networks generalize without fixed mechanisms and that is how they generalize, noting, Neural networks aren't made of fixed mechanisms, they have flows of information and intensities of neural activity.
   - They linked to a [tweet](https://x.com/norabelrose/status/1905336894038454396) arguing that they *can't be organized into a set of parts with fixed functions*.
- **Do Circuits just not exist?**: One member suggested interpretability tools will need to describe the manipulation of entire manifolds of data at once rather than zeroing in on the model's behavior for specific samples, suggesting such descriptions may be more architecture invariant than activation or weight based approaches.
   - In a possible galaxy-brained moment, this member grew more sympathetic to saying **circuits aren't real**.
- **CoT is actually good!**: One member stated that **CoT** is actually good and is one of the best interp tools.
   - They linked to a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11926) showing that monitoring a frontier reasoning model, such as OpenAI o3-mini, for reward hacking in agentic coding environments by using another LLM that observes the model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can be far more effective than monitoring agent actions and outputs alone.

> `GPT-NeoX Data Chunking, Cross-Document Attention, FA3 Support for H100s, FP8 and H100 performance` 


- **GPT-NeoX Data Chunking Discussed**: A member raised concerns about data chunking with **GPT-NeoX** for training on the **Common Pile v0.1**, especially with documents exceeding the context length.
   - It was noted that the current preprocessing script might not handle pre-chunking, potentially leading to correlated examples in batches.
- **Cross-Document Attention Remains On**: A member noted that there is no way to turn off cross document attention within the same sequence.
   - This can affect performance and training dynamics, particularly with chunked data.
- **FA3 Support Boosts H100 Performance**: It was mentioned that **FA3 support** brings a noticeable speedup on **H100s** compared to **A100s**, but is not currently implemented in NeoX.
   - This could influence hardware considerations for training runs.
- **FP8 Branch Achieves High H100 Throughput**: A member reported that they have a branch with added features (definitely **FP8** and possibly **FA3**) that's getting **580 TFLOP/H100/s** and **10,312 T/H100/s**.
   - This indicates significant performance improvements on **H100s** due to recent optimizations.

- **OpenAI Revenue Triples, Gunning for AGI**: According to a Bloomberg [report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/openai-expects-revenue-will-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year?srnd=undefined), **OpenAI** expects its revenue to triple this year to **$12.7 billion**, projecting **$125B** by 2029, becoming cash flow positive as they chase AGI.
- **Midjourney CEO Bitter over 4o Image Generation**: The **Midjourney** CEO reportedly said that **4o imagegen** is slow and bad, claiming OpenAI is just trying to raise money and it's a meme not a creative tool, further postulating that in one week nobody will talk about it anymore, according to [this tweet](https://x.com/flowersslop/status/1904984779759480942).
- **Sparse Autoencoders Don't Change the Game**: Research from the GDM mechanistic interpretability team indicates that **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)** don't help probes generalize OOD and aren't a game-changer, as detailed in [this post](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4uXCAJNuPKtKBsi28/) on the Alignment Forum.

> `GPT-4o Image Generation Rollout, Naming Conventions for Models, Gary Marcus on AI Economics, White House Deletes Ghibli-Style Tweet` 


- **GPT-4o's Confusing Image Generation Launch**: The rollout of **GPT-4o's** image generation feature in ChatGPT was criticized for being confusing, despite OpenAI's claim that paying users received it quickly.
   - A member noted that *the warning for free users using outdated stuff was late, tiny, and easy to miss*, referencing [Simon Willison's blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/introducing-4o-image-generation/) about the launch and its issues.
- **Model Naming Conventions Confuse Users**: Members discussed that having *path-dependent names for models* is confusing because **model names should not require you to know of every other model to understand them**.
   - One member found **QvQ** cute but still questioned its practicality, while another proposed naming it **QwQ-V** to clarify its function.
- **Gary Marcus Flags Dubious AI Economics**: **Gary Marcus** posted a [substack article](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/genais-day-of-reckoning-may-have) arguing that *the economics of generative AI do not make sense*, referencing his previous warnings about technical limits dating back to **2001**.
   - He pointed out that **Nvidia**, despite making profits from AI, is facing headwinds, with its stock down **17.75%** YTD, though it was pointed out that this YTD number was from 2025.
- **White House's Dark Ghibli Tweet Pulled**: The White House deleted a tweet featuring a Ghibli-style image, which was characterized as *dark* by a member.
   - Reportedly it was a "ghiblified" horrifying detention center photo.

- **Divergence on using C Unions**: One member asked about how `union` lowers into and another member suggested a C union.
   - The second member said, *Since iirc CUDA has unions in some parts of the API.*
- **Traits Discussion Reveals Nuances**: A discussion about extension methods and traits, with a member pointing out that extensions allow adding methods to **library types**, a feature not directly available with Rust's `impl` due to orphan rules.
   - Another member corrected that Rust's `impl` can implement library types.
- **Exploring Implicit Trait Implementations Soundness**: Debate on implicit trait implementations, with one member expressing hope they are temporary and stating they *make marker traits hazardous to have*.
   - Other members discussed ways to propagate trait implementations, mentioning the possibility of naming extensions and discussing the soundness tradeoffs.
- **Tuple Mutability Draws Disbelief**: A member noted that assigning to an index inside a tuple is possible and can be done with indexing.
   - Another member highlighted that this is *a side effect of `__getitem__` returning a mutable reference* and noted that it should not be the case.

   - Unlike SetFit, these reranker models are for classifying pairs of text, often queries and answers, and are commonly used as "rerankers" in a 2-stage retriever-reranker pipeline.
- **LLMs Can Output JSON in Various Modes**: A user asked about using LLMs to generate JSON text, and another user confirmed that it is possible to get a JSON output from LLMs like **ChatGPT** by providing examples in the prompt or using a JSON mode.
   - It was highlighted that while LLMs can generate JSON, they might not be suitable for large data processing directly, like PDFs, and suggested chunking for large documents.
- **Converting PDFs to JSON with Chunking**: A user inquired about converting large PDFs into JSON format for finetuning but another user suggested chunking for large documents.
   - It was noted that while direct PDF to JSON conversion might be challenging for large files, one could extract data from the PDF, convert it to CSV, and then to JSON, or use chunking strategies before feeding it to an LLM.
- **Training Model on Precaution Data**: A user was seeking methods to train a model on precaution data, converting it to JSON for finetuning, with the goal of providing precautions based on danger levels and was thinking of converting it into JSON format for finetuning

   - Staff are reportedly in *open revolt* due to the cuts.
- **GPT-4o Confirmed as Autoregressive Image Model**: **GPT-4o** is confirmed to be an autoregressive image generation model, detailed in [OpenAI's Native Image Generation System Card](https://cdn.openai.com/11998be9-5319-4302-bfbf-1167e093f1fb/Native_Image_Generation_System_Card.pdf).
- **Speculation Surrounds Image Token Reusal in GPT-4o**: Speculation arises that **GPT-4o** reuses image input tokens for image output, suggesting it may output the same format of image tokens used as input.
   - It was observed that when asked to exactly reproduce an image, the model introduces small changes, indicating a *semantic encoder/decoder* instead of pixel-level encoding, with one member stating that *OpenAI were saving it until Google releases a good model to take away attention.*

- **Pre/Post Hooks unsupported in Triton Autotune**: *pre_hook* and *post_hook* are not supported in `triton.Autotune` or `triton.Config` due to requiring python code execution at runtime, which **Inductor** can't support in AOTI.
   - A member stated that implementing this support shouldn't be too hard.
- **Hopper's num_ctas Mystery**: It appears that no one is using a `num_ctas` value higher than 1 for **Hopper** in Triton, due to crashes or `RuntimeError: PassManager::run failed` exceptions.
   - The root cause of these issues remains unclear.
- **Local Tensor Expansion Woes**: A member is facing issues porting code using `torch.Tensor.expand()` to Triton due to unsupported tensor index for repeating elements of a local tensor.

> `LlamaExtract Schema Inference, TS Chatbot with Postgres DB, E-commerce Chatbot Architecture, SQL Query Generation Issues, Structured Prediction Bug` 


- **LlamaExtract Ditches Schema Inference**: The schema inference capability in **LlamaExtract**, announced last year, has been de-prioritized because most users already have the schema they need, as stated in the [LlamaExtract Announcement](https://example.com/llamaextract_announcement).
   - The feature may return in the future, but other aspects are being prioritized.
- **TS Chatbot Tussles with Postgres Data**: A user inquired about using **LlamaIndex** with a relational Postgres database and a recommendation was made to use a text-to-SQL application built with **LLM objects**.
   - Converting data to a vector DB was deemed unhelpful due to the nature of relational data, but there is a [TS package](https://ts.llamaindex.ai/docs/llamaindex/tutorials/workflow) that may help with workflows.
- **E-commerce Chatbot Multi-Agent Mayhem**: A user considering a multi-agent system with a react agent and functional handoff agents for an e-commerce chatbot received a suggestion to stick to **function calling agents** if the LLM supports it.
   - Websockets were recommended for providing quick replies, but the choice depends on the overall system architecture.
- **Chatbot struggles with SQL Query Generation**: A user building a chatbot that generates SQL queries from user messages reported issues with the bot not picking the appropriate columns, even with column comments in the SQL file.
   - No specific solution was provided but it was suggested the user file a bug report to the team.
- **Structured Prediction Bug causes Dict Field Fail**: A bug was reported where structured prediction fails with Dict fields, potentially due to limitations in JSON schema or OpenAI's support for annotations, as noted in [Issue #18298](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/issues/18298).
   - Workarounds include giving the field a description and setting the type to Any, or defining another Pydantic model to describe the dict field.

> `Atom of Thoughts (AOT), Tree of Thoughts (ToT), Markovian Reasoning, Two-phase Transition, Atomic Granularity & Dependencies` 


- ****AOT vs ToT****: The poster distinguishes **Atom of Thoughts (AOT)** from **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** by detailing that AOT reasoning steps are memoryless whereas ToT maintains the entire tree history, furthermore AOT has explicit decompose-then-contract phases targeting atomic, indivisible subquestions whereas ToT explores branching thoughts without explicit contraction.
   - AOT also forces decomposition into atomic subquestions structured as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whereas ToT allows varying granularity without enforced dependencies.
- ****Evaluation Datasets Suitability****: Ideal evaluation datasets include [GSM8K and MATH](https://example.com/datasets) (datasets with step-by-step solutions), [HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA](https://example.com/datasets) (annotated reasoning paths), and Datasets explicitly detailing intermediate reasoning steps.
   - The poster included examples such as `mock_llm_client.generate.side_effect = ["0.9", "42"]`.
- ****Decomposition Strategy with LLMDecomposer****: AOT uses flexible decomposition via `LLMDecomposer`, where prompts adapt by question type (MATH, MULTI_HOP), supports custom decomposers and dynamic prompt selection, and ensures atomicity through a contraction validation phase.
   - Example decomposition prompt includes `QuestionType.MATH: Break down this mathematical question into smaller, logically connected subquestions: Question: {question}`.
- ****AOT integrates with DSPy****: AOT integrates smoothly into DSPy workflows, enhancing reasoning by fitting DSPy's modular design, synergizes with DSPy optimizers (like MIPROv2), complements DSPy's inference strategies, allowing efficient scaling, and complements DSPy's dynamic routing, intelligently adapting reasoning paths.
   - The poster confirms that they have *a working implementation of this ready to go.*
