  **Nvidia's Nemotron** ranks #1 open model on LMsys and #11 overall, surpassing
  **Llama-3-70b**. **Meta AI** released **Chameleon 7B/34B** models after
  further post-training. **Google's Gemini** introduced context caching,
  offering a cost-efficient middle ground between RAG and finetuning, with a
  minimum input token count of 33k and no upper limit on cache duration.
  **DeepSeek** launched **DeepSeek-Coder-V2**, a 236B parameter model
  outperforming **GPT-4 Turbo**, **Claude-3-Opus**, and **Gemini-1.5-Pro** in
  coding tasks, supporting 338 programming languages and extending context
  length to 128K. It was trained on 6 trillion tokens using the **Group Relative
  Policy Optimization (GRPO)** algorithm and is available on Hugging Face with a
  commercial license. These developments highlight advances in model
  performance, context caching, and large-scale coding models.

> AI News for 6/17/2024-6/18/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**415** channels, and **3582** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **397 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Today was a great day for AINews followups:

-  Nvidia's Nemotron ([our report](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-to-be-named-2748/)) now ranks [#1 open model on LMsys and #11 overall](https://x.com/lmsysorg/status/1802836187511713933) (beating Llama-3-70b, which [maybe isn't that impressive](https://x.com/agihippo/status/1802845990329737687) but perhaps [wasnt the point](https://x.com/kuchaev/status/1802889658294288706)), 
- Meta's Chameleon ([our report](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-chameleon-metas-unreleased-gpt4o-like/)) 7B/34B was released (minus image-output capability) after [further post-training](https://x.com/ArmenAgha/status/1803141009267990929), as part of a set of [4 model releases today](https://x.com/AIatMeta/status/1803103538169651679)

But for AI Engineers, today's biggest news has to be the [release of Gemini's context caching](https://x.com/officiallogank/status/1803096828595863608?s=46&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww), first teased at Google I/O ([our report here](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-google-io-in-60-seconds/)).

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/208873c2-7d1d-46d9-be26-dda2e947a88b.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Caching is exciting because it creates a practical middle point between the endless RAG vs Finetuning debate - instead of using a potentially flawed RAG system, or lossfully finetuning a LLM to maaaaybe memorize new facts... you just allow the full magic of attention to run on the long context and but pay 25% of the cost (but you do pay $1 per million tokens per hour storage which is presumably a markup over the raw storage... making the breakeven about the 400k tokens/hr mark):  

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/e278f575-8f5e-49a5-87eb-2e130c57d4c8.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Some surprises:

- there is a *minimum* input token count for caching (33k tokens)
- the context cache defaults to 1hr, but has [no upper limit](https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1803113392565264723) (they will happily let you pay for it)
- there is [no latency savings for cached context](https://x.com/johnowhitaker/status/1803111007835005187)... making one wonder if this caching API is a "price based MVP".

We first discussed context caching with Aman Sanger on [the Neurips 2023 podcast](https://www.latent.space/p/neurips-2023-startups) and it was assumed the difficulty was the latency/cost efficiency around loading/unloading caches per request. However the bigger challenge to using this may be the need for prompt prefixes to be dynamically constructed per request (this issue only applies to prefixes, dynamic suffixes can work neatly with cached contexts).

- **Async function word doesn't eliminate stack need**: One user argues that putting the word `async` in a function signature doesn't magically remove the need for a stack in programming. They humorously suggest making the word zero characters long for brevity if it could.
- **FFI thread safety constraints**: Discussions highlight that not all FFI types are thread-safe, presenting a constraint that needs addressing especially in a model assuming every function is async. The comparison is drawn between potential solutions and the traditional concept of function coloring with different defaults.
- **Concurrency model and async/await syntax**: It's explained that async/await is part of a concurrency model providing an interface for parallel or distributed systems programming. The significance of schedulers being orthogonal to syntax is highlighted, allowing programmers to write concurrent programs without manual thread management.
- **Debate on in-language FFI handling**: There's a recurring discussion about how different languages like Swift and Python handle FFI and threading, with references to approaches such as pinning non-thread-safe FFI code to a single CPU core. The conversation suggests that while Mojo plans to support FFI robustly, it's still a work in progress.
- **Mojo community updates and resources**: The recording for the third Mojo Community Meeting is shared, providing insights into updates such as the Lightbug HTTP framework, compile-time assertion constraints, and Python/Mojo interop. The community is encouraged to watch the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/onrRbJ6DeYg) for more details.

- **Agent Hospital Simulacrum Introduced**: A member linked to an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02957) that introduces **Agent Hospital**, a system simulating the entire process of treating illness with autonomous agents powered by LLMs. The paper discusses **MedAgent-Zero**, which helps doctor agents learn and improve their treatment performance by simulating disease onset and progression.
  
- **Real-World Application of Agent Hospital**: The paper highlighted in the discussion claims that the knowledge acquired by doctor agents in **Agent Hospital** is applicable to real-world medicare benchmarks. Accumulating experience from treating around ten thousand patients in the simulation helps improve performance, replicating years of real-world learning.
