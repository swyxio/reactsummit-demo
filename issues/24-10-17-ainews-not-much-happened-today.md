- **[Un Ministral, des Ministraux](https://mistral.ai/news/ministraux/)** ([Score: 39, Comments: 10](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g50sbn/un_ministral_des_ministraux/)): Mistral AI has released new models including **Mistral 7B**, **Mixtral 8x7B**, and **Mistral Small**, with the latter two being **commercially licensed**. The company's decision to restrict access and impose licensing fees for some models has sparked debate about the balance between open-source principles and commercial interests in AI development. This shift in Mistral's approach contrasts with their initial commitment to open-source models and raises questions about the future direction of AI model distribution and accessibility.
  - **Mistral's new models** spark debate on open-source vs. commercial AI development. Some users express disappointment with the **restrictive licensing**, with one stating "No Apache Licence, F * Irrelevant".
  - The **multilingual capability** of new models is noted as the biggest advancement, though not considered hugely exciting by some users. Others look forward to trying the models, hoping they will "punch above their weight" like previous Mistral offerings.
  - The **research license** for the 8B model is viewed positively by some for ERP research. However, concerns are raised about the lack of weights for the 3B model and the restrictive nature of the 8B license.
- **Why ther is no middle ground version of llama between 8 and 70b?** ([Score: 46, Comments: 80](https://reddit.com//r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g4wul3/why_ther_is_no_middle_ground_version_of_llama/)): The post questions the **absence of mid-sized Llama models** between **8B and 70B** parameters, highlighting a gap in options for users with **8-16GB GPUs**. The author notes that while a **4GB 3050 GPU** can run the **8B model** adequately, there's no suitable option for more powerful consumer GPUs that can't handle the **70B model**. They suggest developing a **16B parameter model** to fill this gap in the Llama model lineup.
  - Users discussed the potential for **home labs** and **consumer-grade AI hardware**, with some suggesting that tinkerers might soon have personal "hardware brains" for AI processing.
  - **Meta's Llama models** are not designed with consumer GPUs in mind; the **8B model** is considered the "local" version, while larger models target datacenters. Some users recommended alternatives like **Gemma 2's 9B and 27B models** as ideal mid-sized options.
  - The community debated the absence of a **mid-sized Llama model**, with mentions of a **32.5B original model** and a failed **Llama 2 mid-sized version**. Some suggested trying other models like **Qwen2.5 14B**, which reportedly outperforms **Llama 3.1 8B**.
