- **Hermes 2.5 vs Mixtral Performance**: `@teknium` and other users engaged in a discussion comparing the performances of **Hermes 2.5** and **Mixtral**. One user, `@fullstack6209`, shared his user experience that highlighted Mixtral's superior performance in certain benchmark testing. Both models were noted to originate from the Nous Research team, with a user (`@vic49.`) mentioning the latest release, **Nous Hermes 2 - Yi-34B - GGUF Quantized Version**. The link: [Nous Hermes 2 - Yi-34B - GGUF Quantized Version](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B-GGUF) was posted in relation to this conversation. 

- **Code Contamination in Models**: A lively conversation was held concerning the issue of code contamination in AI models. Users `@.beowulfbr` and `@nonameusr` led the discussion, mentioning the difficulty of benchmarking models and problems with "contaminated" base models like **yi-34b**.

- **Experience with Reddit Users**: The chat between `@.beowulfbr` and other users like `@weyaxi`, `@ldj`, and `.benxh` suggested dissatisfaction with the Reddit user community, citing negative experiences they had.

- **NeurIPS 2023**: User `@lejooon` asked about ways to access NeurIPS 2023 talks without being in attendance. Responses from `@itali4no` and `@gabriel_syme` suggested that online tickets would need to be purchased or one could wait for potential free access after a few weeks.

- **LM Studio Compatibility**: User `@vic49.` inquired about the compatibility of models produced by Nous Research with LM Studio. Specific reference was made to **Nous Hermes 2 - Yi-34B - GGUF Quantized Version**. `@teknium` confirmed that they are indeed compatible.

- **Usage of <0x0A> in the LLM**: `@teknium` pointed out that `<0x0A>` is used to denote a newline in a model script. This was further validated by `@everyoneisgross`, though they also noted a complication with their mixtral model, which seemed to convert the tag into string and alter their text. This suggested a possible bug in the script.
- **Model Selection for Local LLM Training**: `@leuyann` sought recommendations for models suited for local and non-local fine-tuning and testing with reference to reasoning enhancements in large language models (LLMs). `@eas2535` clarified that while CUDA was not needed for the 4-bit quantized version of Mixtral, it did require substantial RAM, which made it unsuitable for systems with 16GB memory. `@night_w0lf` recommended starting with a 3B base model such as StableLM before taking on larger models like a 7B Mistral.
- **Converting Models to fp16**: `@mgoin` raised the issue of running Nous Hermes 2 - [Yi-34B](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B) in fp16, noting that the model produced NaNs when run in that precision. They noted the lack of support for bfloat16 in PyTorch's fake_quantize. `@teknium` advised simply changing the torch.dtype to float16.
- **Data Cleaning and Dataset Formation**: `@.beowulfbr` sought suggestions in building and cleaning datasets. `@teknium` recommended using Lilac, an open-source data improvement tool by @tomic_ivan. `@spencerbot15` provided the corresponding [link](https://docs.lilacml.com/) to the Lilac documentation.

## [DiscoResearch](https://discord.com/channels/1178995845727785010) Discord Summary

- Anergetic discussions on the **bias of LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation**, highlighting concerns such as exploitation of *GPT-4's preference for long outputs*. Possible mitigation strategies included evaluating questions with reference answers.
- Examination of the **application of Disco Judge in different evaluation contexts**. Difference in contexts noted, with *reference answers not always being available* in instances like synthetic data filtering or quality assurance.
- Conversation regarding the limitations of the **LLM-as-a-Judge methodology**. Issues raised included inherent biases or narrow scope depending on whether an LLM determines answer quality or if it compares to a reference answer generated by an LLM.
- Conclusion that there's a need for continued discussions and **quantification of these limitations** in LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methods.
- Presentation of **benchmarked results of various 7B models**. Models discussed include *xDAN-AI/xDAN-L1-Chat-RL-v1*, *openchat/openchat-3.5-1210*, *Weyaxi/SauerkrautLM-UNA-SOLAR-Instruct*, and *upstage/SOLAR-10.7B-Instruct-v1.0*. The benchmarking tool and source code was mentioned as [EQbench](https://www.eqbench.com/) with the accompanying [Source Code](https://github.com/EQ-bench/EQ-Bench) and [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06281).

- **Discussion on the Bias of LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation**: `.calytrix` expressed concerns about models being fine-tuned to exploit the biases of a judge model such as **gpt-4's preference for long outputs**. They suggested mitigating this issue by evaluating questions that have reference answers.
- **Application of Disco Judge in Different Evaluation Contexts**: `_jp1_` responded by stating that for "real" evaluation and benchmarks, reference answers would be helpful but in applications like synthetic data filtering or quality assurance, reference answers often do not exist. They highlighted that **Disco Judge** aims to accommodate both use cases.
- **Limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge Methodology**: `.calytrix` further brought up that the current llm-as-a-judge benchmarks could be limiting as they either allow the llm to determine what is a good answer based on any set metric, or they compare to a reference answer generated by an llm. 
- **Need for Active Discussion on Drawbacks**: `bjoernp` agreed with the concerns and emphasized the need for active discussions and quantification of these limitations later down the line.
