<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Depth is all you need.** We couldn't decide what to feature so here's 3 top stories.

> AI News for 7/8/2024-7/9/2024.
We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**463** channels, and **2038** messages) for you. 
Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **250 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Two major stories we missed, and a new one we like but didn't want to give the whole space to:

1. [**Lilian Weng on Extrinsic Hallucination**](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/): We [usually](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-lilian-weng-on-video-diffusion/) drop everything when the Lil'Log updates, but she seems to have quietly shipped this absolute monster lit review without announcing it on Twitter. Lilian defines the SOTA on **Hallucination Detection**  (FactualityPrompt, FActScore, SAFE, FacTool, SelfCheckGPT, TruthfulQA) and **Anti-Hallucination Methods** (RARR, FAVA, Rethinking with Retrieval, Self-RAG, CoVE, RECITE, ITI, FLAME, WebGPT), and ends with a brief reading list on other **Hallucination eval** benchmarks. We definitely need to do a lot of work on this for our Reddit recaps.
2. [**MobileLLM: Optimizing Sub-Billion Parameter Language Models for On-Device Use**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MobileLLM): One of the [most hyped](https://x.com/_akhaliq/status/1761951318711640355/quotes) FAIR papers published at the upcoming ICML (though not even receiving a spotlight, hmm) focusing on sub-billion scale, on-device model architecture research making a 350M model reach the same perf as Llama 2 7B, [surprisingly in a chat context](https://x.com/reach_vb/status/1809866925637345750?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1809866925637345750%7Ctwgr%5E984c999745e3e6e2d8c7fddc68a5da7d52f1352f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emergentmind.com%2Fpapers%2F2402.14905). [Yann LeCun's highlights](https://x.com/ylecun/status/1810035281472491665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1810035281472491665%7Ctwgr%5E984c999745e3e6e2d8c7fddc68a5da7d52f1352f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emergentmind.com%2Fpapers%2F2402.14905): 1) thin and **deep**, not wide 2) **shared matrices** for token->embedding and embedding->token; **shared weights** between multiple transformer blocks".   ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/d10e727f-a5cd-4296-82d6-0aab39bf2fb0.png?w=960&fit=max) 
3. [**Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States**](https://github.com/test-time-training/ttt-lm-pytorch) ([advisor](https://x.com/xiaolonw/status/1810387662060269668), [author](https://x.com/karansdalal/status/1810338845659131940) tweets): Following [ICML 2020](https://x.com/xiaolonw/status/1283447035673210880) work on Test-Time Training, Sun et al publish a "**new LLM architecture**, with linear complexity and expressive hidden states, for long-context modeling" that **directly replace attention**, "**scales better (from 125M to 1.3B) than Mamba and Transformer**" and "**works better with longer context**".
 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/e7a54ad3-16ba-41cb-af6d-6a963705490c.png?w=960&fit=max) Main insight is replacing the hidden state of an RNN with a small neural network (instead of a feature vector for memory).  ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/83f3f5fd-1460-4e33-8881-dd75a3a9b6a3.png?w=960&fit=max)  The [basic intuition](https://x.com/xiaolonw/status/1810387664929173520) makes sense: "If you believe that training neural networks is a good way to compress information in general, then it will make sense to train a neural network to compress all these tokens." If we can nest networks all the way down, how deep does this rabbit hole go?

[Turbopuffer also came out of stealth](https://turbopuffer.com/blog/turbopuffer) with a small well received piece.

> - `Timer Cycle Functions` 


- **Clock Calibration Causes 1 ns Difference**: A member pointed out that running both `_clock_gettime` calls back to back results in a 1 ns difference, causing issues when calibrating one clock from another.
   - *Since this is attempting to calibrate, the minimal difference impacts the accuracy*, leading to potential timing discrepancies.
- **Timer Cycle Functions for Multiple Architectures**: Code for obtaining timer cycles on x86 and ARM architectures was shared, using specific LLVM intrinsics and inline assembly respectively.
   - The function defaults to error handling if neither architecture is detected, printing an error message and exiting.

- **Brain size riddle solved**: A study published in [Nature Ecology & Evolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02451-3) reveals that the largest animals do not have proportionally bigger brains, with humans bucking this trend.
   - Researchers at the University of Reading and Durham University collected data from around **1,500 species** to clarify the controversy surrounding brain size evolution.
- **Linearity in brain size questioned**: It's suggested that the black line in the brain size plot isn't straight but **slightly curved** at the end.
   - This raises questions about the dependency of the relationship between larger animals having bigger brains on its linearity.
- **Reproductive benefits of intelligence**: Discussion on whether the reproductive benefits of increased intelligence were limited in the ancestral environment if the scaling hypothesis is true.
   - One participant noted that *brain size is only part of the picture*, with structure and neuronal density also being important.
- **Neuronal density and intelligence in various species**: *In mammals*, overall cortical neuron count gives a good map of the intelligence distribution since structure is almost the same across the board.
   - *In birds and lizards*, the density of all neuron types matters more, although data is sparse unless differentiated by structures.
