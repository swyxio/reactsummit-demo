- **Adding Custom Tasks**: User `@gabriel_syme` expressed positivity towards broader evaluations, appreciating the ability to include attacks and prompt engineering. The efficiency of this technique, however, will be determined by the **ease of adding custom tasks**.


### ▷ #[interesting-links](https://discord.com/channels/1053877538025386074/1132352574750728192/) (185 messages🔥🔥): 
        
- The conversation started with a discussion about the efficacy of **Instruction Finetuning (IFT)** and the possibility of incorporating **pretraining data** during fine-tuning to prevent **catastrophic forgetting**. User `@euclaise` suggested including data such as **GoodWiki** for factuality, but cautioned that for models like **Mistral**, this approach could potentially degrade the model's performance, due to Mistral's high-quality base data.

- The discussion further evolved to consider the possibility of using higher quality data like **ARXIV papers** in combination with general **pretrain data** to maintain a model's non-domain-specific capabilities, even when it is being fine-tuned towards a particular domain. This led to the recommendation of mixing pretraining data with **Instruction Finetuning (IFT) data** in a ratio of **1:100** if working with a large SFT dataset. 

- One contraindication was made by `@tokenbender` stating that if the objective was **memorization**, extensive finetuning on pretraining data could lead to **significant hallucinations**. This invoked a discussion around successful model training strategies and the importance of preserving a model's base capabilities while minimizing hallucinations and data loss.

- The members also discussed the practical application of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** in the context of AI research. `@gabriel_syme` and `@giftedgummybee` propose a **step-by-step** approach, moving from structured data towards task-specific data, suggesting that it could be a more effective way of conducting retrieval, as more traditional retrieval methods were resulting in irrelevant selection.

- Lastly, the conversation touched upon the limitations of **GPT-4**, with several members expressing disappointment over its reasoning capabilities and outputs. They suggested that the model's performance seemed to have regressed compared to an earlier iteration, which was apparently more effective.


### ▷ #[general](https://discord.com/channels/1053877538025386074/1149866623109439599/) (98 messages🔥🔥): 
        
- **AI Model Performance and Usage**: Discussion surrounds the performance and usage of multiple AI models. `@makya` expressed surprise over **Character Ai** being used more than **Bard and ChatGPT**. In the same vein, there was confusion around a chart suggesting **Claude** has much more usage than other models, prompting `@night_w0lf` to suggest that it represents overall usage, with each provider adding to this total.

- **Testing Models and Potential Improvements**: `@gitmo joe` and `@teknium` had contrasting views on the performance of **4bit Mistral** vs **unquantized Mistral**, with teknium arguing that 4bit **Mistral** performs better assuming the same dataset fine-tuning. `@gabriel_syme` shared their experience of testing **gpt4-vision** for the first time, finding it useful for data annotation in multimodal environments but unclear on how to provide prompts effectively.

- **AI Training Strategies and Developments**: `@fblgit` proposed the idea of a **knowledge infinite-turn conversation training doctrine**, involving reading a dataset as an iterative and synthesized interaction for gradual improvement in model learning. Separately, `@mihai4256` made their plan known to continue manually writing dataset samples.

- **Discord Server Reorganization**: `@teknium` mentioned the restructuring of the server and the addition of a public project called **Project Obsidian**. A few users mentioned access issues with the new channels, but these were resolved after refreshing their Discord.

- **Upcoming AI Models and Predictions**: Members anticipated the release of new AI models like **UNA Solar**. Predictions regarding the potential performance of these models on the **MMLU (Multiple-Choice Machine Learning Understanding)** were made. Some users joked about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) being achieved through a random model merge or by Nous Research.

- **Deploying/Running an LLM locally**: User `@deki04` asks for a guide to deploy/run an LLM locally and prefers via a CLI but a GUI option would be good too. `@teknium` shares an **OpenHermes** script for inference, which can be adapted for back and forth chats, and suggests that `@deki04` look into `llama.cpp` for fast inference on a Mac. They note that Mac can only utilize CPU with transformers. 
- **FInetuning QLORA model**: User `@.beowulfbr` shares their configuration and raises a concern about training loss not decreasing significantly while fine-tuning an OpenChat 3.5 model using QLORA with a dataset of 300k entries. `@teknium` assures that this is normal behavior and the model will stay relatively flat after epoch 1.  
- **Validation during QLORA Training**: User `@ruggsea` ask for insight into validation during QLORA training and best practices for splitting a finetuning dataset into train/validation sets.
- **GPT-4 Finetuning**: `@semantic_zone` inquires why there hasn't been more discussion about *GPT-4 finetuning*, particularly for reasoning. `@giftedgummybee` responds indicating a couple reasons which include the costs associated with it and it being heavily gated.

- **Parsing Output in Langserve**: User `@rodralez` encountered an issue when trying to parse the output from a template application in Langserve. They wanted to display only the "output" key of a JSON object in the Output window instead of the entire JSON object. Trying to achieve this by using `lambda x: x["output"]` resulted in disappearing of the chat history. They were seeking possible solutions to this problem. The template application being used can be viewed [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/9ef2feb6747f5a69d186bd623b569ad722829a5e/templates/retrieval-agent).

- **LangServe Route Adding Issue**: `@vilelaone` had a problem adding routes using LangServe with their `AgentExecutor`. While their agent execution worked standalone, it failed when added with LangServe. An attempt to use a custom input and output model led to a ValueError of expecting one output key but receiving more.

- **ConversationBufferMemory Impact**: A small discussion suggested that the use of `ConversationBufferMemory` could be causing the above issues, as the chat history was disappearing for `@rodralez` and the `LangServe` route addition was failing for `@vilelaone`.

- **Solving Problem with output_key**: `@vilelaone` was able to resolve their issue by using `output_key="output"` in `ConversationBufferMemory`. It was noted that this is necessary for `LangServe`, even though the standalone `AgentExecutor` works fine without it.

## [DiscoResearch](https://discord.com/channels/1178995845727785010) Discord Summary

- Dialogue regarding **fine-tuning challenges with 7b models**, with observations that 7b models can be hard to fine-tune using LoRA due to a propensity for performance degradation and catastrophic forgetting. *User `@.calytrix` speculated this could be due to mixtral's dense yet low-redundancy 7b models*. 
- Comparative conversation between **Foundation 7b vs Old 7b** models. User `@fernando.fernandes` mentioned that the new 7b models seem more challenging for everyone despite the old 7b models being denser and more sensitive to catastrophic forgetting.
- Theory by `@fernando.fernandes` discussing **self-attention orthogonality and performance**, proposing that performance could be linked to the information volume in the self-attention layers. Especially, in poorly performing models such as the undi95 mixtral fine-tune, the self-attention layers are more orthogonal.
- Proposed solutions for **fine-tuning** from `_jp1_` and `@fernando.fernandes`. They recommend methods such as higher dropout rates, freezing router layers, and potential freezing of the embed_token layer. All suggestion aim to improve the performance of models like mixtral 7b.

- **Fine-tuning Challenges with 7b Models**: User `@.calytrix` has observed that the 7b models are particularly challenging to fine-tune with LoRA without causing performance degradation or catastrophic forgetting. This user speculates that the issue might be tied to **mixtral's** dense, low-redundancy 7b models which might be less tolerant to LoRA fine-tuning.
- **Foundation 7b vs Old 7b**: `@fernando.fernandes.` shares the observation that everyone, regardless of their finetuning methods, appears to be struggling with the new 7b models. This is contrary to the experience with the older 7b models, which are even denser and thus more susceptible to catastrophic forgetting.
- **Self-Attention Orthogonality and Performance**: `@fernando.fernandes.` proposes that the amount of information stored in self-attention layers, conceptualized as databases, is related to their rankings and orthogonality. He noted that for models with poor performance, such as the undi95 mixtral finetune, the self-attention layers tend to be more orthogonal. Here, orthogonality is measured via the Frobenius norm calculated between the weights of self-attention modules from diverse experts.
- **Potential Solutions for Fine-tuning**: User `_jp1_` proposes that QLoRA fine-tuning may not work well with router (or gate) layers, thus requiring higher dropout rates. Future rounds of finetuning, incorporating frozen router layers and additional bugfixes/improvements, could significantly improve performance. `@fernando.fernandes.` agrees with this and suggests that it may be necessary to **freeze the embed_token layer** as well, though the reason for its potential positive impact still needs to be understood.
