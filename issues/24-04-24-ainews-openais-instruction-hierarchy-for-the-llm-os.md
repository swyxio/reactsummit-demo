<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 4/23/2024-4/24/2024. We checked 7 subreddits and [**373** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **27** Discords (**395** channels, and **6364** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **666 minutes**.

In general, every modern operating system has the concept of "protection rings", offering different levels of privilege on an as-needed basis:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ef0283c2-2c8a-4aaf-84f0-11a7991c3b89.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Until ChatGPT, models trained as "spicy autocomplete" were always liable to prompt injections:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/a6edde4d-e948-49ca-bf4b-7f93dcbebc61.png?w=960&fit=max) 

so the solution is of course privilege levels for LLMs. OpenAI [published a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13208) on how they think about it for the first time:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f2448e39-c8be-4591-a14a-daa0423b61b4.png?w=960&fit=max)

This is presented as an alignment problem - each level can be **aligned** or **misaligned**, and the reactions to misalignment can either be **ignore and proceed** or **refuse** (if no way to proceed). The authors synthesize data to generate decompositions of complex request, placed at different levels, varied for alignment and injection attack type, applied on various domains.

The result is a general system design for modeling all prompt injections, and if we can generate data for it, we can model it:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/14244827-5aa4-48f8-a0e2-456abdc84b99.png?w=960&fit=max) 

With this they can nearly solve prompt leaking and improve defenses by 20-30 percentage points.

As a fun bonus, the authors find that just adding the instruction hierarchy in the system prompt LOWERS performance for baseline LLMs but generally improves Hierarchy-trained LLMs.

- **DiscoLM's Dual EOS Tokens Explained**: In Llama3's instruct configuration, two end-of-speech (eos) tokens are used: `128001` for regular end of text, and `128009` for end of a conversational turn. The latter helps to manage multiturn conversations by signaling the model to stop answering while still considering the text as part of the same conversation.

- **Ninyago's Coding Dilemma Resolved**: After encountering a problem with **DiscoLM_German**, ninyago received advice to simplify the code by excluding the attention mask and using `model.generate(input_ids=gen_input)`. Other suggestions included utilizing text generation [pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) for simplicity and `vllm` for faster GPU inference or `llama.cpp` for CPU.

- **Optimizing Generation Length**: To increase model output to a desired length, ninyago was advised to use the `max_new_tokens` parameter instead of relying on `max_tokens`. The suggestion was based on avoiding sentence cutoffs and ensuring that prompts like `Schreib maximal 150 Wörter.` are effectively executed.

- **Prompting in Dual Language Forms**: A community member enquired about the effectiveness of prompting DiscoLM models in German using either the "du" or "Sie" form.

- **Contributions to DiscoLM Welcomed**: In response to johannhartmann's interest in contributing quantizations for the Llama3_DiscoLM_German_8b_v0.1_experimental model, _jp1_ encouraged the collaboration despite future model improvements being on the horizon, suggesting that there was no necessity to wait for the newer version.

- **Verbose Prompt Option Confusion**: The **--verbose-prompt** option, although listed in the help file of the Meta-Llama 3-70B Instruct llamafile as a feature for printing prompts before generation, triggers an *unknown argument error* when used, leading to confusion over its validity.

- **Backend Service with Llamafile**: Members discussed methods to use Llamafile for a backend service without the UI popping up, including the option of running the LLM using Llamafile as a method or service on a different port.

- **Using Llamafile in Server Mode without Browser**: A detailed implementation guide for running a llamafile in server mode using subprocess in Python was provided. It includes starting the llamafile with a **nobrowser** option to use the backend API and details on configuring and sending requests to different model instances.

- **mlock Failure on Windows When Loading Model**: A user encountered a memory locking issue, `failed to mlock 90898432-byte buffer`, when trying to load the Mixtral-Dolphin model on a Windows machine equipped with a Ryzen 9 5900 and 128GB RAM, suspecting the problem might be due to the application being 32-bit.

- **Using External Weights with Llamafile on Windows**: In response to the mlock issue, it was pointed out that Windows might require the use of external weights, with a focus on using the bare llamafile from Mozilla-Ocho’s GitHub and the specific command *llamafile-0.7.exe --mlock -m dolphin-2.7-mixtral-8x7b.Q5_K_M.gguf*. However, the mlock failure persisted even when running another model, phi2 llamafile.
