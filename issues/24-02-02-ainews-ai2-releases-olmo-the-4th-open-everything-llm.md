description: >-
  **AI2** is gaining attention in 2024 with its new **OLMo** models, including
  1B and 7B sizes and a 65B model forthcoming, emphasizing open and reproducible
  research akin to **Pythia**. The **Miqu-70B** model, especially the Mistral
  Medium variant, is praised for self-correction and speed optimizations.
  Discussions in **TheBloke** Discord covered programming language preferences,
  VRAM constraints for large models, and fine-tuning experiments with
  **Distilbert-base-uncased**. The **Mistral** Discord highlighted challenges in
  the **GPU shortage** affecting semiconductor production involving **TSMC**,
  **ASML**, and **Zeiss**, debates on open-source versus proprietary models, and
  fine-tuning techniques including **LoRA** for low-resource languages.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI Discords for 2/1/2024. We checked **21** guilds, **312** channels, and **5874** messages for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **483 minutes**. We enountered stability issues with very link-heavy messages (thanks @yikesawjeez...) that we had to figure out how to address.

As teased on Nathan Lambert's [Latent Space appearance](https://www.latent.space/p/rlhf-201), we're about to see AI2 come up a lot more this year under new leadership. The first results of that are coming through now with [OLMo](https://allenai.org/olmo/olmo-paper.pdf) (Open Language MOdels) - a 1B, and set of 7B models, with a 65B on the way.

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/bbb5cb1e-b02f-41f7-9da0-31dce096f27f.png?w=960&fit=max) 

[Nathan's Substack](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/olmo) has the less corpo take if you enjoy that tone (we do) and it is also fun to note that [the releasing-models-thru-magnet-link meta](https://twitter.com/natolambert/status/1753063313351835941) still has not yet run out of juice.

In the LS Discord we had the honor of discussion with Nathan in more detail, including the odd choice to release a "Twin" AMD model, the exclusion of Mistral 7B from benchmarks, and more.

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/09aedd23-595b-48fd-bc44-6e12b56d7df4.png?w=960&fit=max) 

We happened to cover Pythia ([one of the top 10 papers of 2023](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/10-ai-research-papers-2023)) in this week's Paper Club, and Nathan agreed that OLMo might be regarded a spiritual successor to Pythia in its commitment to reproducible and fully open research. 

Hopefully the start of more in 2024.

- **Saving and Reusing Chain of Thought**: `@byronhsu` inquired about the outcomes of saving a model's chain of thought (CoT) and then using it as input for subsequent prompts. The aim is to reduce the time and cost of multiple iterations, questioning whether this technique affects the reasoning abilities of the model.
- **Latency Tradeoff in CoT Approach**: `@justahvee` confirmed that feeding a previously saved CoT into a second step works but noted a tradeoff with inference latency due to multiple calls (the original generation and the follow-up inference).
- **Clarifying Inference Latency Concerns**: `@byronhsu` sought clarification from `@justahvee` on the inference latency issue, assuming that feeding in a CoT directly should result in faster inferences.
- **Explaining the Latency Tradeoff**: `@justahvee` explained that the latency experienced is due to the total time of the initial CoT generation and the second inference using the CoT, as it involves multiple separate calls.
- **Assurance on Accuracy Retention**: `@byronhsu` received confirmation from `@justahvee` that accuracy is retained when CoT output from one step is used as input for the next step.

- **A Warp-Speed Experiment**: `@zippika` shared[ code](https://example.com/link-to-code) for `rgb_to_grayscale` CUDA kernel optimizations, utilizing **ulong** for vectorized loads per warp. This unique approach loads three pixels at a time, aiming to increase efficiency.
- **Crank up that Occupancy**: Subsequent modifications led to a much higher **occupancy** with a calculated theoretical of **100%** but a measured achieved occupancy of **77%**, indicating better utilization of GPU resources in `@zippika`'s experiments.
- **Throughput Under the Microscope**: `@zippika` posted the **GPU Throughput** analysis, highlighting **Memory** utilization at **71.87%** and **Compute (SM)** usage at **46.36%**, reflecting the comprehensive workload distribution of their GPU-based computation.
- **Speed Bumps Ahead**: Despite the conceptual success, `@zippika` mentioned not having tested the speed and later followed up to report that the new implementation appears to be **slower** in practice.
- **Thinking Out Loud with Emoji Support**: The user apologized for the seemingly disorganized messages, expressing that the comments were part of a thought process, accompanied by a unique emoji (`<:floom:799302782477402142>`), indicating a mix of informal communication and technical content.
