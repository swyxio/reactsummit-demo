In the race for "open o1", DeepSeek r1 ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-deepseek-r1-claims-to-beat-o1-preview-and/)) still has the best results, but has not yet released weights. An exhausted-sounding Justin Lin [made a sudden late release today](https://x.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/1861858852855320803) of QwQ, **weights, demo and all**:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f5da457a-5f23-4b1a-a24b-e395f826ab10.png?w=960&f**it=max)

Quite notably, this 32B open weight model fully trounces GPT4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on every benchmark.

Categorizing QwQ is an awkward task: it makes enough vague handwaves at sampling time scaling to [get /r/localLlama excited](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1h1c691/qwq_reflect_deeply_on_the_boundaries_of_the/):

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/edb7d8eb-6402-42e0-b064-2a4f7d495254.png?w=960&fit=max)

But [the model weights itself](https://x.com/gazorp5/status/1861883506055606567) show that it looks like a Qwen 32B model (probably Qwen 2.5, [our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-o1-destroys-lmsys-arena-qwen-25-kyutai/)), so perhaps it has just been finetuned to take "time to ponder, to question, and to reflect", to "carefully examin[e] their work and learn from mistakes". "This process of careful reflection and self-questioning leads to remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems". All of which are vaguely chatgptesque descriptions and do not constitute a technical report, but the model is real and live and downloadable which says a lot. The open "reasoning traces" demonstrate how it has been tuned to do sequential search:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/6e367ece-86e3-4c03-b18f-144a9320d46e.png?w=960&fit=max)

A fuller technical report is coming but this is impressive if it holds up... perhaps the real irony is Reflection 70B ([our coverage here](https://x.com/swyx/status/1832234771973583220)) wasn't wrong, just early...

**[Sponsored by SambaNova]** Inference is quickly
becoming the main function of AI systems, replacing
model training. It’s time to start using processors that
were built for the task. SambaNova’s RDUs have
[some unique advantages](https://shortclick.link/lk96sw) over GPUs in terms of speed and flexibility.

> **swyx's comment**: [RDU's](https://shortclick.link/lk96sw) are back! if a simple 32B autoregressive LLM like QwQ can beat 4o and 3.5 Sonnet, that is very good news for the alternative compute providers, who can optimize the heck out of this standard model architecture for shockingly fast/cheap inference.

> `FSDP multiple ranks, FLOPS counting challenges, GPU performance discrepancies, Math library workspace issues, Efficient use of FLOP counters`

- **How to load a pretrained model in FSDP?**: To load a pretrained model across multiple ranks for FSDP2, it's essential to **manually shard** the weights before loading them, as illustrated in [this example](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/blob/b5d2e6372017c163914b13b2514f29914e5dbb84/torchtune/training/_distributed.py#L150-L223). The process involves initializing the full model on each rank and sharding the weights step-by-step without materializing the complete model weights on any single GPU.
- **Challenges in FLOPS counting**: Counting **FLOPS** can be problematic as many operations evade detection by existing scripts, leading to erroneous flop counts impacting research reliability. Suggested solutions include tools such as [fvcore](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore/blob/main/docs/flop_count.md) and [torch_flops](https://github.com/zugexiaodui/torch_flops) for more accurate measurements.
- **GPGPU performance discrepancies**: One user noted that their calculations suggest a **\>3k tok/s** performance for GPT-2 Small on a 3080Ti, which is not being met in practice. Concerns were raised over potential factors like different **kernels** and **temporary workspaces** in math libraries that might lead to unexpected memory usage.
- **Workspace issues may cause OOMs**: The size of temporary workspaces in math libraries can vary by hardware, leading to out-of-memory errors. Users can override workspace settings—like `CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG`—to manage memory better, although hardware changes can still complicate matters.
- **Nuances in FLOPS counting**: Accurate counting of **FLOPS** is nuanced as even when operations are detected, subtleties remain that can affect results. One user expressed frustration at their **GPT-2** model's performance, suspecting missing FLOPS may cause performance discrepancies.

> `LoLCATs paper, ThunderKittens kernel, Model Throughput Issues, Linearized Attention Performance`

- **LoLCATs Paper Insights**: A discussion arose around the [LoLCATs paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10254) focusing on linearizing LLMs without full model fine-tuning, noting its performance dropped to **half throughput** compared to **FA2** for small batch sizes.
  
  - Interestingly, the linearized model shows memory savings but fails to outperform the previously expected **quadratic attention model**.
- **Questioning Kernel Efficiency**: Uncertainty was expressed regarding what kernels are being used in the LoLCATs implementation, specifically whether the **ThunderKittens** kernel or a less efficient one is employed.
  
  - Members inferred that the results may suggest the use of the ThunderKittens kernel based on the Appendix, yet it raised questions about overall efficiency.
- **MLP Size vs. Context Window**: Discussions highlighted concerns that the **4k context window** might be too small to significantly impact performance when considering the MLP weight matrix sizes.
  
  - The weight matrix properties reveal that MLP sizes outscale the KV matrix dimensions, potentially affecting throughput.
- **Algorithmic Gains vs. Performance**: Participants noted that the algorithmic gains from the attention operator at **4k sequences** may be overshadowed by linear projections and the full FFN block.
  
  - Despite these expectation, there remained a surprising disparity in throughput as indicated in the initial findings of the paper.

  - This involved setting parameters such as location and username in the messages for the model.
- **Function Calling outputs empty**: Despite the setup, the model returned empty outputs when invoked with **function calling**, showing a JSON response with **content** field empty.
  
  - This indicates a potential issue as the same member reported receiving reasonable outputs when **function calling** was not used.
- **Seeking community insights on function calling**: The member asked if others in the community successfully used **function calling** with OpenRouter, expressing concerns about the empty response.
  
  - They highlighted that their attempts without tools went smoothly, raising questions about the specific issues with this setup.
