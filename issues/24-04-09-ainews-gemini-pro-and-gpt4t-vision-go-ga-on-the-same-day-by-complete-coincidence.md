<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 4/8/2024-4/9/2024. We checked 5 subreddits and [**364** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **26** Discords (**388** channels, and **4154** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **468 minutes**.

Incremental improvements, but big nonetheless:

- On the first day of [Google Cloud Next](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next), **the million-token context window [Gemini 1.5 Pro was let out of waitlist jail](https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1777733743303696554)** and freely available in 180+ countries. Additionally, it can:
  - understand up to 9.5hrs of audio ([quote](https://twitter.com/liambolling/status/1777758743637483562): "not just the words you’re saying but the tone and emotion behind the audio. In some cases it even understands some sounds such as dogs barking and rain falling.")
  - "upload nearly unlimited files and it's free" with a new [File API](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/prompting_with_media)
  - `Gecko-1b-256/768` aka `text-embedding-004` model, a new small embedding model that beats peer-size models on MTEB
  - JSON mode & better function calling
- 3 hours later, [GPT-4 Turbo with Vision is now generally available in the API](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1777769463258988634) but hidden in it was a major update to the GPT-4 Turbo language model itself. 
  - There's not even a blogpost - all we know is that it is [majorly improved](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1777772582680301665) and specifically [reasoning has been further improved](https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1777809000345505801). Maybe it just got really really really good at [delving](https://x.com/ChatGPTapp/status/1777221658807521695)?

Lots more smaller updates from Cohere Command R to Google CodeGemma in the recaps below.

- **Debate on the Nature of Averages in ScheduleFree Optimizer**: There is an extensive discussion about the nature of the *1/t* term in ScheduleFree optimizer. One faction clarifies that a learning rate *beta=1-1/t* does *not* give you an exponential moving average but a simple mean of all values, evidenced by the calculation *1 * (1/2) * (2/3) * (3/4) * ... * (1-1/t) = 1/t*.

- **Exponential vs. Simple Moving Average Misconception**: The discussion about the ScheduleFree optimizer continues with explanations provided on the distinction between exponential and simple moving averages, ending with the clarification that ScheduleFree keeps a simple average, *not* an exponential one.

- **Exploration of Knowledge Storage Capacity in LLMs**: Members shared insights from a research paper, discussing the efficiency of knowledge storage in language models. The paper's findings suggest that language models can store 2 bits of knowledge per parameter, gated MLPs may impair knowledge storage, and MoEs are relatively efficient.

- **Dense vs. Sparse Training in MoEs**: A new [paper about Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05567) is shared which proposes a dense training and sparse inference framework, claiming better parameter efficiency and comparable performance to dense models, calling into question the parameter efficiency when scaling.

- **Optimizer Effectiveness in Large-Scale Models**: The conversation touches upon the effectiveness of the LAMB optimizer with references to papers that question its benefits. One member suggests a [batch size invariant version of Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18824) for large-scale, distributed settings, which purportedly offers batch size invariance without the strong assumptions needed for LARS and LAMB.

- **F-strings in Mojo Still Pending**: Members have confirmed that `f` string functionality is not supported in Mojo yet. The feature is awaited by users looking for Python-like string formatting capabilities.
- **Exploration for Local Documentation Command**: A user inquired about a command to download Mojo documentation locally, similar to Rust's documentation command, but no such command exists at the moment. They were advised to use the online documentation or clone the Git repository for now.
- **Quality of Local vs. Online Documentation**: There's a discussion on whether the local Git repository documentation is as structured and up-to-date as the online documentation. Links to online [Mojo standard library modules](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/lib) were shared for users preferring structured resources.
- **Temporary Solution for String Formatting**: While waiting for the `f` string functionality, a user suggested using C-style formatting [from builtin.io import _printf as printf] for string formatting in Mojo. However, this method may be deprecated in the future.
- **Mojo API Documentation for Beginners**: A user shared a [Notion site link](https://ripple-haddock-938.notion.site/Mojo-40a425eab9104fde8b3e11a2f5a3e078?pvs=4) with translated and summarized API documentation intended to help beginners.
