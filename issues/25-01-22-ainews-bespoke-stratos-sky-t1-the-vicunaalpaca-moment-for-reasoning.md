  **Reasoning Distillation** has emerged as a key technique, with Berkeley/USC
  researchers releasing **Sky-T1-32B-Preview**, a finetuned model of **Qwen 2.5
  32B** using 17k reasoning traces for just **$450**, matching benchmarks of
  **o1-preview**. **DeepSeek** introduced **R1**, a model surpassing
  **o1-preview** and enabling distillation to smaller models like a 1.5B Qwen to
  match **gpt-4o** and **claude-3-sonnet** levels. **Bespoke Labs** further
  distilled **R1** on Qwen, outperforming **o1-preview** with fewer samples.
  This progress suggests that *"SFT is all you need"* for reasoning without
  major architecture changes. Additionally, **DeepSeek-R1** uses pure
  reinforcement learning with supervised finetuning to accelerate convergence
  and shows strong reasoning and multimodal capabilities. **Google's Gemini 2.0
  Flash Thinking** model boasts a **1 million token context window**, code
  execution, and excels in math, science, and multimodal reasoning. Critiques
  highlight challenges in model repeatability, behavioral self-awareness, and
  RLHF limitations in reasoning robustness.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Reasoning Distillation is all you need.**

> AI News for 1/21/2025-1/22/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **34** Discords (**225** channels, and **4297** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **496 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

In the ChatGPT heyday of 2022-23, [Alpaca and Vicuna](https://sapling.ai/llm/alpaca-vs-vicuna) were born out of LMsys and Stanford as ultra cheap ($300) finetunes of LLaMA 1 that distilled from ChatGPT/Bard samples to achieve 90% of the quality of ChatGPT/GPT3.5.

**In the last 48 hours, it seems the Berkeley/USC folks have done it again, this time with the reasoning models.**

It's hard to believe this sequence of events happened just in the last 2 weeks:

1. Berkeley's Sky Computing lab [released Sky-T1-32B-Preview](https://x.com/NovaSkyAI/status/1877793041957933347), a finetune of Qwen 2.5 32B ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-o1-destroys-lmsys-arena-qwen-25-kyutai/)) with 17k rows of training data from QwQ-32B ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-qwen-with-questions-32b-open-weights/)) + [rewriting traces with gpt-4o-mini + rejection sampling](https://x.com/TrelisResearch/status/1879530546038022623), **all done for $450**. Because QwQ outperforms o1-preview, distilling from QwQ brings Qwen up to **match** o1-preview's benchmarks: ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/d2026e95-5756-4266-ad56-21b21c75a5a3.png?w=960&fit=max) ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1e1678a4-d885-4148-b588-c1f967979741.png?w=960&fit=max)
2. DeepSeek releases R1 ([2 days ago](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-deepseek-r1-o1-level-open-weights-model/)) with benchmarks far above o1-preview. The R1 paper also revealed the surprise that you can distill from R1 to **turn a 1.5B Qwen model to match 4o and 3.5 Sonnet** (?!).
3. Bespoke Labs (today) [uses the Sky-T1 recipe to distill R1 on Qwen again](https://x.com/madiator/status/1882131703927652762) to **greatly** outperform (not just match) o1-preview, again with [17k rows of reasoning traces](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bespokelabs/Bespoke-Stratos-17k?row=0). ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/2c7efe2e-2d81-41fb-9737-3a9c369602eb.png?w=960&fit=max) 

While Bespoke's distillation does not quite match DeepSeek's distillation in performance, they used 17k samples vs DeepSeek's 800k. It is pretty evident that they could keep going here if they wished.

The bigger shocking thing is that "**SFT is all you need**" - no major architecture changes are required for reasoning to happen, just feed in more (validated, rephrased) reasoning traces, backtracking and pivoting and all, and it seems like it will generalize well. **In all likelihood, this explains the relative efficiency of o1-mini and o3-mini vs their full size counterparts.**

> `Model Quantization, Fine-tuning Models, DeepSeek R1 Model Support, Chat Templates and Thinking Tags, Dynamic 4-bit Quantization`

- **Discussion on Model Quantization Techniques**: Users debated the effectiveness of various quantization methods, with 8-bit quantization noted for its trade-off between performance and accuracy, while BnB 4-bit was discussed for its dynamic quantization capabilities.
  
  - It was pointed out that while BnB 8-bit isn't well supported, alternative methods like FP8 and Q8_0 offer better flexibility and performance.
- **Fine-tuning with Unsloth**: A user inquired about fine-tuning the unsloth models with chat data, expressing that the model should ideally generate sequential messages rather than single responses.
  
  - Suggestions included ensuring high-quality dataset examples and considering the employment of another model to supervise and review the outputs.
- **DeepSeek R1 Compatibility**: Clarifications about using the DeepSeek R1 model with llama-server revealed that users need to ensure they load the complete model rather than just a part of it for successful deployment.
  
  - Discussion also indicated a broader support for running the model via VLLM, including large versions.
- **Chat Templates and 'Thinking' Tags**: Users explored the lack of a unified 'thinking' tag in chat templates for behavior training in DeepSeek, noting the resultant COT aspect in responses.
  
  - Suggestions were made to either incorporate such templating or to avoid using specific templates entirely during training.

> `Unsloth training on Medium, Weights & Biases ETA tracking, Custom code for ETA, Fine-tuning challenges`

- **Unsloth's Fine-tuning Explored on Medium**: A Medium article discussed [fine-tuning LLMs using Unsloth](https://gautam75.medium.com/fine-tuning-llama-3-1-8b-for-function-calling-using-lora-159b9ee66060) with Weights & Biases and vLLM for model serving, addressing the need for adaptation to specific tasks.
  
  - It highlights challenges in LLM fine-tuning, especially concerning GPU memory and computation time.
- **Weights & Biases Lacks ETA Tracking**: A user expressed disappointment that Weights & Biases does not show an estimated time of arrival (ETA) for training processes, only displaying run time and start time.
  
  - They received confirmation that Weights & Biases *doesn’t track time* but instead focuses on plotting training metrics.
- **Custom Code Needed for ETA**: A community member clarified that while Weights & Biases does not have built-in ETA tracking, it can be done by writing custom code.
  
  - This provides a workaround for users wanting to monitor training completion times more precisely.
