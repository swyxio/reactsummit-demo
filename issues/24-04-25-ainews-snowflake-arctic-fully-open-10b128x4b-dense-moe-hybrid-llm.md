title: 'Snowflake Arctic: Fully Open 10B+128x4B Dense-MoE Hybrid LLM'
date: '2024-04-26T01:33:53.546196Z'
original_slug: ainews-snowflake
description: >-
  **Snowflake Arctic** is a notable new foundation language model released under
  Apache 2.0, claiming superiority over **Databricks** in data warehouse AI
  applications and adopting a mixture-of-experts architecture inspired by
  **DeepSeekMOE** and **DeepSpeedMOE**. The model employs a 3-stage curriculum
  training strategy similar to the recent **Phi-3** paper. In AI image and video
  generation, **Nvidia** introduced the **Align Your Steps** technique improving
  image quality at low step counts, while **Stable Diffusion 3** and **SD3
  Turbo** models were compared for prompt understanding and image quality.
  **Adobe** launched an AI video upscaling project enhancing blurry videos to
  HD, though with some high-resolution artifacts. **Apple** released open-source
  on-device language models with code and training logs, diverging from typical
  weight-only releases. The **Llama-3-70b** model ties for first place on the
  LMSYS leaderboard for English queries, and **Phi-3** (4B params) outperforms
  **GPT-3.5 Turbo** in the banana logic benchmark. Fast inference and
  quantization of **Llama 3** models were demonstrated on MacBook devices.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 4/24/2024-4/25/2024. We checked 7 subreddits and [**373** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **27** Discords (**395** channels, and **5506** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **631 minutes**.

This one takes a bit of parsing but is a very laudable effort from Snowflake, which til date has been fairly quiet in the modern AI wave. [Snowflake Arctic](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/arctic-open-efficient-foundation-language-models-snowflake/) is notable for a few reasons, but probably not the confusing/unrelatable chart they chose to feature above the fold:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/8a45195d-2c7c-420b-a6cc-dcf124fc1d84.png?w=960&fit=max) 

"Enterprise Intelligence" one could warm to, esp if it explains why they have chosen to do better on some domains than others:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1ab962bf-83de-4037-8fc1-b0a1e1bfa9d3.png?w=960&fit=max) 

What this chart *really* shows in not very subtle ways is that Snowflake is basically claiming to have built an LLM that is better in almost every way to Databricks, their main rival in the data warehouse wars. (This has got to smell offensive to Jon Frankle and his merry band of Mosaics?)

Downstream users don't care *that* much about training efficiency, but the other thing that should catch your eye is the model architecture - taking the right cue from [DeepSeekMOE](https://x.com/deepseek_ai/status/1745304852211839163) and [DeepSpeedMOE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05596)) with more experts = better:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/bcd39b75-ae22-43fa-be38-72ce278d1140.png?w=960&fit=max) 

No mention is made of the "shared expert" trick that DeepSeek used.

Finally there's mention of a 3 stage curriculum:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/21e13aaa-64f0-4924-b7d9-9c80f723e6ec.png?w=960&fit=max) 

which echoes a similar strategy seen in the recent Phi-3 paper:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/24598097-2055-4691-89dd-90c83d91df37.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Finally, the model is released as Apache 2.0.

Honestly a great release, with perhaps the only poor decision being that [the Snowflake Arctic cookbook](https://medium.com/@snowflake_ai_research/snowflake-arctic-cookbook-series-exploring-mixture-of-experts-moe-c7d6b8f14d16) is being published on Medium dot com.

- **Training Models with Instructions**: A discussion on whether including instructions in model training loss is redundant was initiated. It was noted that the parameter `train_on_inputs` from *Axolotl* influences this and that bypassing instructions during fine-tuning might be sensible for most tasks.

- **Synthetic Data Strategy Inquiry**: One member sought advice on generating diverse synthetic data for training models. Recommendations included exploring [GitHub - argilla-io/distilabel](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel), and examining projects such as WizardLM, Airoboros, Phi, Alpaca, and Orca.

- **The Paradox of Overfitting**: Debate occurred over the utility of validation sets during training, with some arguing that the validation loss doesn't necessarily correlate with real-world performance and that checkpoint evaluations might be more efficient. The conclusion seemed to favor minimal epochs and evaluating last epochs for performance.

- **Long Context Management in LLMs**: An exchange about the abilities of LLMs, specifically Llama3, in managing long contexts took place. Participants mentioned that merely extending context without proper understanding isn't sufficient, and techniques like **rope scaling** were brought up as methods currently being used.

- **Quantized Model Finetuning Quandary**: An inquiry about improving performance on a quantized version of a model (*Q4_K_M*) led to suggestions around data quantity and LORA vs QLORA approaches.

They emphasize that while **vLLM's local Python mode** is convenient for experimentation and development, decoupling components allows for easier LLM swaps on different infrastructures or through APIs.

- **Batch Completion Operations Without an API Server**: A contribution is made about using `litellm.batch_completion` to run batch requests against an API server, but a member specifies they prefer to operate directly in Python without an API server, intending to stick with **vLLM** and the `vllm.LLM` class.

- **TGI Focused on Low Latency, vLLM on High Throughput**: The distinction between **TGI** and **vLLM** is highlighted in a message, with TGI being described as API-first and focused on low latency, whereas vLLM is noted for being an easy-to-use library oriented towards cost-effective, high throughput deployment.

- **Prompt Nuances in German**: A user inquired about the impact of using the informal "du" versus the formal "Sie" in prompting the DiscoLM series models in German, seeking insights based on others' experiences.

- **Challenges with Text Summarization Constraints**: A user expressed difficulties in getting DiscoLM models to adhere to a 150-word count or a 1000-character limit for text summarization tasks, noting that the `max_new_tokens` parameter resulted in mid-sentence cutoffs.

- **Queries on Sharing Quantifications**: A member contemplated providing quantifications for experimental versions of the Llama3_DiscoLM_German_8b_v0.1 model, questioning if it's better to contribute now or wait for a more advanced release. Another user encouraged sharing, noting that while upcoming improved versions are in the works, they will take some time to be production-ready.

- **Phi-3's Impressive Benchmarks**: A user shared excitement after discovering that Phi-3 scored nearly perfectly on the Ger-RAG-eval, and asked the community for guidance on how to apply a "classification mode" for live inference using the model, similar to benchmark evaluations.

- **Technical Difficulties with DiscoLM-70b**: A member reported encountering a "Template not found" error and nonsensical outputs when attempting to interact with DiscoLM-70b using the `huggingface/text-generation-inference` endpoint, despite the successful run process.

**Datasette - LLM (@SimonW) ▷ #[llm](https://discord.com/channels/823971286308356157/1128504153841336370/1232708130018951209)** (7 messages): 

- **Python API mysteries solved**: A member inquired about [Python API documentation](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html) for **Datasette's LLM**, to use it programmatically for tasks like embedding a directory of text files. Another user provided a direct link to the detailed explanation on how to utilize the Python API.
 
- **Claude meets Hacker News with LLM CLI**: **Simon Willison** discussed using Claude in conjunction with the [LLM CLI tool](https://llm.datasette.io/) for summarizing long Hacker News threads. He elaborated on his process and provided a [link to his workflow](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes) using the LLM CLI with an LLM plugin.

- **Embedding API Usage Explored**: For embedding text files through the Python API, the conversation pointed to [LLM's embedding API documentation](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/python-api.html), which includes code snippets and usage examples for handling embeddings efficiently, including `embed_multi()` for multiple strings.

- **Python Equivalent for CLI Embedding Feature**: The creator, **Simon Willison**, clarified that there is no direct Python equivalent for the "embed every file in this directory" CLI feature, but he shared the relevant section in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/simonw/llm/blob/04915e95f8ab490d6a82900ccba92ad3fe93d2ab/llm/cli.py#L1217-L1360) where one can see how the CLI implements it using the Python API.
