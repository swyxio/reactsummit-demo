- **Unlocking LLM Secrets via API**: A recently discussed [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09539) explores how to extract non-public information about API-protected Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 by exploiting the softmax bottleneck—revealing details such as hidden model size with a relatively low number of API queries.
- **Discussion on Carlini's Latest Work**: A participant referenced a recent paper by Carlini et al. that investigated the model size estimation through logits but noted that the key details were redacted.
- **Surprise Over Alleged Model Size**: One member expressed surprise that the model size could be 7B parameters, suggesting such an estimation seems implausible.
- **Skepticism on Model Size Accuracy**: Resistance to the 7B size estimate was voiced, with speculation that the calculation might be flawed, especially if GPT-3.5 is a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model.
- **Theory of Distillation or Mixtures in Models**: A discussion speculated on the use of *'mega distillation sauce'* or token-critical mixtures in turbo LLMs, citing past research that showed the beginning tokens are crucial for performance in tasks like math problems.
