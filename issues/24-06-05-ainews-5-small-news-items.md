- **Script to test HF Models generates buzz**: Members discussed a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/pull/328) that adds a script for users to quickly test model evaluation with torchao APIs. One user reported issues with Out of Memory (OOM) errors while quantizing and evaluating large models on GPU.
  
- **OOM Problems with Large Models**: A member noted that running the default script caused OOM errors, suggesting to load models on CPU before quantization to avoid this. They observed that memory issues also depend on the task and the model's vocabulary size.

- **Investigating OOM Issues**: Users looked into the root of these OOM issues, mentioning a high number of open issues in the [EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness repository](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/issues?q=is%3Aissue+oom+is%3Aopen+). They discussed that large vocab sizes, such as in llama3, exacerbate these problems.

- **Specific Task Memory Usage**: When running tasks like wikitext, the need for large logits tensors can cause memory issues, unlike smaller tasks like hellaswag which use shorter sequences. This observation highlighted the impact of specific evaluation tasks on memory requirements.

- **Optimizations and Discussions on Quantization**: There was a technical discussion on whether `torch.compile()` should be applied after or before quantization, concluding it should be done before in their case. It was also noted that Intel recommends disabling fast math for the inductor CPU backend.

- **Efficient cuda stream usage discussed**: Members discussed the need for migrating all operations to the "main stream" to improve performance. **Eriks.0595** noted the benefit of **named streams** and reassured the code should not show any operations on the legacy stream post the initial memcpy.

- **Fixing Pytorch DDP Loss Bug**: **Aleksagordic** fixed a bug in PyTorch DDP loss computation where losses were not reduced properly before being logged, causing a perceived divergence with the C implementation. They submitted a [PR](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/pull/551) to correct this issue.

- **Performance Optimization for Matrix Operations**: There were detailed discussions on **optimizing matrix operations** in CUDA, with members noting substantial but not maximal speed gains with improved memory load patterns. **Aleksagordic** sought clarifications on warp formation and correct kernel implementation to ensure no future tokens are inaccurately computed.

- **Ensuring Deterministic Kernel Implementation**: Emphasis was placed on making sure all kernels used are deterministic by avoiding atomic operations. An action item was noted for **global norm kernel** to finalize deterministic operations by using CPU buffers for partial sums.

- **Deposition Day**: **Akakak1337** mentioned being unavailable due to a deposition related to Tesla, humorously noting the **minimal financial compensation** for their time and the adversarial nature of the process.
