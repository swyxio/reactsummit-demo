People are still very much exploring the implications of Anthropic's new Computer Use demo/usecases. Some are pointing out [its failures](https://x.com/natolambert/status/1849082872436793647?s=46) and [picking apart the terminology](https://x.com/doomslide/status/1849204183205081231), others have hooked it up to [phone simulators](https://x.com/mckaywrigley/status/1849145631895593292) and [real phones](https://x.com/ethansutin/status/1849187111255310513?s=46). Kyle Corbitt somehow [wrote a full desktop app for Computer Use in 6 hours](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41926770) so you dont have to spin up the docker demo Anthropic shipped.
