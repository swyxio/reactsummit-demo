# AI Twitter Recap

**OpenAI GPT-5 product updates, routing economics, and evals**

- [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1955438916645130740): GPT-5 now supports “Auto/Fast/Thinking” modes in ChatGPT with GPT‑5 Thinking at 196k tokens, 3,000 msgs/week, and overflow to GPT‑5 Thinking mini. 4o returns to the picker; “Show additional models” exposes o3/4.1/GPT‑5 mini; 4.5 remains Pro‑only due to GPU cost. Personality changes are coming plus per‑user customization.
- Monetization via routing: Multiple observers argue the real “GPT‑5 release” is the router that dynamically sends requests to cheaper models to cut compute costs ([@dylan522p](https://twitter.com/dylan522p/status/1955433082397589900); “router will get very good very fast” per [@finbarrtimbers](https://twitter.com/finbarrtimbers/status/1955633697635631112)). As [@jefrankle](https://twitter.com/jefrankle/status/1955634983021998252) notes, reliable signals are needed to learn good routing decisions. Separately, Plus vs Pro users appear to have different “thinking budgets” ([@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1955610515134460285)).
- Serving variance matters: For GPT‑OSS‑120B, [@jeremyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1955438370274087369) recommends Fireworks, DeepInfra, and Together as accurate hosts. [@giffmana](https://twitter.com/giffmana/status/1955710876528599217) says Microsoft/Amazon reportedly used older vLLM defaults and medium reasoning effort, explaining lower quality and “>10% degradation” complaints (called “fraud” by [@nrehiew_](https://twitter.com/nrehiew_/status/1955613510463037611)).
- Evals snapshot: GPT‑5 topped FrontierMath with nuanced deltas; holdout vs non‑holdout performance and “unguessable” answers detailed by [@EpochAIResearch](https://twitter.com/EpochAIResearch/status/1955667249252978741). On RooCode, GPT‑5 is 55% slower but ~40% cheaper vs Sonnet 4 ([@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1955669720843358502)).

**GPT‑OSS: base model extraction, hosting, and low‑level tooling**

- Base extraction from reasoning model: [@jxmnop](https://twitter.com/jxmnop/status/1955436067353502083) released gpt‑oss‑20b‑base extracted from OpenAI’s reasoning checkpoint, crediting [@johnschulman2](https://twitter.com/johnschulman2). Next steps: generation checks for memorization, instruction tuning, and trying 120B ([follow‑up](https://twitter.com/jxmnop/status/1955436118620488059)). Community discussion cautions on calling it a “base model” and suggests probing train‑data leakage via perturbations ([@eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/1955479573489213593), [@florian_tramer](https://twitter.com/florian_tramer/status/1955510942252572946), [@OfirPress](https://twitter.com/OfirPress/status/1955463664556769426)).
- Hosting and orchestration: gpt‑oss‑120B shows strong tool‑calling for multi‑tool pipelines in a single prompt ([@reach_vb](https://twitter.com/reach_vb/status/1955678303395696821)). Infra work on the OSS stack includes a high‑throughput training/inference PR with flex‑attention, complex freqs, grouped‑GEMM MoE, and checkpoint converters ([@khoomeik](https://twitter.com/khoomeik/status/1955433361402724679)).

**Anthropic: Opus‑plan/Sonnet‑execute, 1M context, prompt caching, Humanloop**

- Model pairing in code: “Opus plan, Sonnet execute” is now officially supported in Claude Code via /model, routing high‑level planning to Opus 4.1 and task execution to Sonnet 4 ([@_catwu](https://twitter.com/_catwu/status/1955694117264261609); [@alexalbert__](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1955687538129252807)). Sonnet 4 context expands to 1M tokens on the API ([@claude_code](https://twitter.com/claude_code/status/1955471002353242605)); prompt caching TTL is now 1 hour GA ([docs](https://twitter.com/claude_code/status/1955475387858972986); [@alexalbert__](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1955709585999978613)). Cline added immediate support for Sonnet‑1M ([@cline](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1955776052644732938)).
- Team moves: The Humanloop team joins Anthropic to accelerate safe enterprise adoption ([@humanloop](https://twitter.com/humanloop/status/1955487624728318072); [@RazRazcle](https://twitter.com/RazRazcle/status/1955488872235929712)).

**DSPy 3.0 and the rise of prompt/black‑box optimizers**

- DSPy 3.0 ships with GRPO/RL training, SIMBA, and GEPA; the latter is touted as beating RL on prompt optimization ([@CShorten30](https://twitter.com/CShorten30/status/1955445406441033906); [@MaximeRivest](https://twitter.com/MaximeRivest/status/1955431980868542692)). Practitioners are already adapting GEPA (e.g., to Observable JS) ([@LakshyAAAgrawal](https://twitter.com/LakshyAAAgrawal/status/1955455810802421991)).
- Ecosystem traction: multi‑language DSPy ports, production use for agentic flows, small demos like a <200 LoC agent with DSPy + bash, and detailed guides to MIPROv2 configuration ([@lateinteraction](https://twitter.com/lateinteraction/status/1955419751246934187), [@JuiceSharp](https://twitter.com/JuiceSharp/status/1955460115957682444), [@rasmus1610](https://twitter.com/rasmus1610/status/1955617801802260691), [@heylegacyguy](https://twitter.com/heylegacyguy/status/1955682283270078484)).

**Open models, toolchains, and leaderboards (Qwen, GLM, qqWen, Kimi, Mistral)**

- Qwen momentum: Qwen3‑Coder is live ([@Alibaba_Qwen](https://twitter.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/1955436295603490864)); Deep Research now supports image/file inputs ([tweet](https://twitter.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/1955642787619381325)); Qwen Image is faster on Qwen Chat and Image Edit is in testing ([tweet](https://twitter.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/1955656265499316406); [tweet](https://twitter.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/1955656822532329626)). The open‑finetuning suite qqWen (1.5B–32B) publishes code/weights/data for a niche financial programming language (Q) across pretrain+SFT+RL ([@brendanh0gan](https://twitter.com/brendanh0gan/status/1955641113693561071)).
- GLM and coding IDEs: Zhipu’s GLM‑4.5 integrates natively with Kilo Code; devs report quality gains ([@Zai_org](https://twitter.com/Zai_org/status/1955627932543840510); [@Kilo_Code](https://twitter.com/Kilo_Code/status/1955629042205696084)).
- Leaderboards: On LmArena’s August Text Arena, Qwen‑3‑235b‑a22b‑instruct takes #1 among open models; GLM‑4.5 debuts #4; OpenAI gpt‑oss‑120B debuts #7; top open models place within the overall top‑50 ([@lmarena_ai](https://twitter.com/lmarena_ai/status/1955669431742587275)).
- Tooling: Anycoder adds Mistral Medium 3.1 ([@_akhaliq](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1955621767302808012)). Hugging Face TRL now supports VLM SFT, multimodal GRPO, and MPO ([@mervenoyann](https://twitter.com/mervenoyann/status/1955622287920537636)).

**Agents, evaluation, and infra debugging**

- Tool‑use benchmarks: LiveMCPBench evaluates 10 frontier models on 95 time‑sensitive tasks across 527 tools. Claude Sonnet 4 leads with 78.95% success; the dominant failure mode is tool discovery, not execution. Costs track performance; LLM‑as‑judge agrees with humans ~81% ([@_philschmid](https://twitter.com/_philschmid/status/1955601309966447074); [paper](https://twitter.com/_philschmid/status/1955601312059461681)).
- Real‑world agent gap: METR finds a gap between algorithmic scoring and practical usability for autonomous agents on real software tasks from their RCT, calling for broader but usable metrics ([@METR_Evals](https://twitter.com/METR_Evals/status/1955747420324946037)).
- System/UI support: LangChain releases a Deep Agents UI for TODOs, file systems, and subagents ([@LangChainAI](https://twitter.com/LangChainAI/status/1955674201853247584)); DAIR AI announces a hands‑on “Building Effective AI Agents” course ([@dair_ai](https://twitter.com/dair_ai/status/1955623925901353351)).
- Infra debugging and perf: vLLM details CUDA core dump debugging with recommended env vars ([blog](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/1955478388178817298)); Jina shares GGUF embedding optimization on L4 (IQ3_S, batch 512, c=2048) reaching ~4,143 tok/s with ~2GB VRAM ([thread](https://twitter.com/JinaAI_/status/1955647947359867068)).

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Qwen Model Real-World Local Usage Reports

- [**God I love Qwen and llamacpp so much!**](https://v.redd.it/ur3oxzhnmsif1) ([Score: 561, Comments: 126](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mp5bjc/god_i_love_qwen_and_llamacpp_so_much/)): **The OP reports running local batch inference with the Qwen3 30B Instruct LLM using llamacpp on a single NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU, processing 4 requests in parallel. This approach is being leveraged for large-scale data processing and platform insights, but the user notes hitting VRAM or throughput bottlenecks and anticipates moving to a multi-GPU setup. (See [Qwen LLM](https://github.com/QwenLM) and [llamacpp repo](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) for model and backend details.)** One commenter requests technical details on how parallel batch inference was achieved, indicating demand for practical guides on running large LLMs locally with consumer GPUs and batching. No substantive technical debate in the comments, only interest in replication.
    - A commenter inquires about practical use cases for batch inference when running language models like Qwen locally, suggesting interest in understanding efficiency gains or scenarios where batch inference would benefit a local, possibly single-user setup.
    - Technical curiosity is revealed as another user asks how the showcased setup (Qwen model with llamacpp) is achieved locally, implying a request for steps or instructions for reproducing multi-modal or advanced inference pipelines in a home environment.
    - There is a subtle reference to screen aspect ratio (21:9) which, while not deeply technical, hints at running models or UIs on ultra-wide displays, potentially relating to productivity or visualization strategies for working with large models locally.
- [**Fully local Qwen 2.5 Omni realtime agent (sees + talks).... tested it by cooking dinner**](https://v.redd.it/m9ttqovtmtif1) ([Score: 211, Comments: 22](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mpayu9/fully_local_qwen_25_omni_realtime_agent_sees/)): **The user deployed a fully local pipeline using the Qwen 2.5 Omni model as a real-time agent, processing webcam video input frame-by-frame and delivering overlayed AI responses in ~1 second latency. Implementation employed the open Qwen model for scene interpretation and highlights included solid single-turn conversation and image-to-text reasoning, but notable weaknesses were found in multi-turn dialog stability and hallucination rate, as well as poor audio understanding unless input was very clean. The repository used is [gabber-dev/gabber](https://github.com/gabber-dev/gabber).** A technical inquiry was raised about the specific model variant in use (in particular, if it is the gguf format), but no further deep discussion of implementation or benchmarks followed.
    - A user inquired specifically about which variant of the Omni model was used in the project, asking if it was the GGUF format, which is often important for compatibility with local deployments and quantized inference engines.
    - Another comment provided a direct link to the GitHub repository ([gabber-dev/gabber](https://github.com/gabber-dev/gabber)), which is relevant for anyone interested in reviewing the source code and assessing the technical implementation details.
    - One comment praised the decision not to include a code editor for LiveKit, suggesting this is a deliberate and smart design choice potentially related to security or minimalism. The commenter also suggested that LiveKit should consider funding such efforts, indicating a recognition of the technical value or novelty of the approach.

### 2. gpt-oss-120B Model Benchmarks and Limitations

- [**gpt-oss-120B most intelligent model that fits on an H100 in native precision**](https://i.redd.it/4okvse7e2rif1.jpeg) ([Score: 305, Comments: 218](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1moz341/gptoss120b_most_intelligent_model_that_fits_on_an/)): **The image presents a scatter plot comparing various AI language models by their 'Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index' (a proxy for model evaluation) and 'Active Parameters at Inference Time' (log scale), with particular emphasis on the gpt-oss-120B model. It highlights that gpt-oss-120B, purported to be the 'most intelligent model that fits on an H100 GPU in native precision,' occupies a favorable position (high intelligence index, moderate parameter count). The analysis implies a tradeoff between intelligence and inference resource use, favoring models like gpt-oss-120B that balance both. [Image link.](https://i.redd.it/4okvse7e2rif1.jpeg)** Technical commenters challenge the framing of 'native precision' (4-bit quantization) as a unique advantage, noting competitive performance from other 4-bit models, and caution against marketing hype. One commenter seeks direct benchmarks comparing gpt-oss-20B and Ernie 4.5 21B, highlighting gaps in current model comparisons.
    - There is skepticism about advertising claims based on "native" precision, which refers to running gpt-oss-120B in 4-bit quantization; several commenters note that other models quantized to 4-bits outperform it, so "native quant" doesn't inherently confer an advantage.
    - A technically relevant omission is the lack of a benchmark comparison between gpt-oss-20B and Ernie 4.5 21B, even though these models are similar in active and total parameter counts. Accurate performance comparisons require side-by-side benchmarks.
    - The Qwen3 30B model is highlighted as outperforming gpt-oss-20B on existing evaluation charts, casting doubt on claims about gpt-oss-20B's leading intelligence for models that fit consumer GPUs.
- [**Peak safety theater: gpt-oss-120b refuses to discuss implementing web search in llama.cpp**](https://i.redd.it/j7hi9xgjrrif1.png) ([Score: 251, Comments: 63](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mp1j7e/peak_safety_theater_gptoss120b_refuses_to_discuss/)): **The image demonstrates a notable 'safety refusal' by the gpt-oss-120B model, where the model declines to provide instructions for adding web search to llama.cpp, citing policy restrictions. Technical discussion in the comments highlights that such censorship behavior can be mitigated by adjusting inference parameters—specifically, increasing 'temperature' to 1.0, and using 'Top_K=0' or 'Top_K=100' with 'Top_P=1.0', which prompts the model to respond without refusal. This suggests the refusal is not hard-coded, but emerges from sampling strategy and likely reflects prominent training tokens in the model's output distribution.** Commenters debate the implications of such refusals, with some noting that these can be circumvented simply by tuning parameters—a characteristic of many so-called 'censored' models. Others express concern that heavily weighted refusal tokens might be problematic and reflect questionable choices in the training or fine-tuning process.
    - Adjusting inference settings (such as **Temperature: 1.0, Top_K: 0/100, Top_P: 1.0**) can mitigate refusals from gpt-oss-120b, indicating that many 'censored' models can be "decensored" by tweaking sampling parameters, rather than requiring model retraining or hacking.
    - Detailed reproduction in **Ollama** using gpt-oss-120b (native MXFP4 quant) shows *no refusals* and a complete breakdown of how to implement web search in llama.cpp, including: use of external search APIs (SerpAPI, Google, Bing, etc.), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, leveraging wrappers like LangChain, llama_server, and including example code and potential pitfalls, highlighting that refusals may be environment- or quantization-specific rather than inherent to the model weights themselves.
    - The debate in the comments points out that if lower temperature (higher determinism) causes a model to default to refusals, it may indicate that the refusals are heavily baked into the fine-tuning or are disproportionately common tokens—raising concerns about practical use and the robustness of 'uncensoring' via mere sampling tricks.

### 3. Nano-banana Text-to-Image Model Launch

- [**There is a new text-to-image model named nano-banana**](https://i.redd.it/jmw88evj4sif1.png) ([Score: 262, Comments: 53](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mp2wq3/there_is_a_new_texttoimage_model_named_nanobanana/)): **The post introduces a new text-to-image model named 'nano-banana' and illustrates its capability with an example: it reconstructs a full face from a partial (eye-level) image input. The image demonstrates that the model outputs a high-fidelity portrait consistent in features with the partial input, suggesting strong image completion or inpainting capabilities. Commenters speculate about its application in image-editing, referencing prompt-driven transformation tasks and comparing it to Gemini-powered image generation (though this is stated humorously in context).** Commenters debate whether the model is related to Gemini's image generation, with one suggesting it's a good fit for advanced image-editing tasks—particularly character or style transformations based on prompts.
    - A commenter notes strong results from the model (nano-banana) for image-editing scenarios, referencing a sample where the prompt successfully altered the depicted characters to resemble 2B from Nier: Automata and Master Chief from Halo, suggesting the model handles complex text-to-image requests well (see [image sample](https://preview.redd.it/efd1pwamnsif1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=63694450033128ea331aea6c05cf1c1cea585fc0)).
    - There is a direct inquiry into whether the model is open source or has open weights, which is highly relevant for community research and further development but remains unanswered in the thread.

### 1. OpenAI GPT-5 & ChatGPT Model Picker and Feature Updates

- [**4o is back—Sam Altman just flipped the switch: Auto, Fast, and Thinking modes, 196k context, and up to 3,000 weekly messages.**](https://i.redd.it/fvn16sqd3pif1.png) ([Score: 267, Comments: 52](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1mos29d/4o_is_backsam_altman_just_flipped_the_switch_auto/)): **The image displays an official update (apparently from Sam Altman) regarding significant feature additions to ChatGPT, notably three selectable GPT-5 modes: Auto (automatically balances speed/depth), Fast (prioritizes response time), and Thinking (slower, deeper responses, now with a 196k token context window). Paid users can send up to 3,000 "Thinking"-mode messages per week before being shifted to a "mini" variant; limits may fluctuate per demand. The previous GPT-4o model is reinstated in the picker, with users able to reveal additional models (e.g., o3, 4.1) through a setting toggle, enabling tailored tradeoffs between capability, speed, and style. This context window and cap increase are especially relevant for sustained research/coding tasks, reducing context-trimming errors. Personality updates are also in progress for GPT-5, targeting a more "warm" but less "try-hard" interaction style.** Commenters note 4o already reappeared several days prior and underscore the importance of communicating model picker settings to users. One suggests the feature reversal is a response to user dissatisfaction and cancellations, implying the update is at least partly reactive to community feedback.
    - The discussion mentions that GPT-4o has reappeared in the model picker for several days, signaling a rapid deployment reversal, possibly in response to user feedback or usage statistics.
    - One comment points out a UX-specific configuration: to see GPT-4o and certain mini/alternate models, users must toggle 'Show additional models' in the ChatGPT web settings. This is a technical workaround that affects model accessibility and discovery.
    - There is speculation that the model's reinstatement was related to a noticeable trend of membership cancellations, suggesting that model availability directly impacts user retention and subscription metrics for OpenAI.

Users can now choose between 'Auto,' 'Fast,' and 'Thinking' modes for GPT-5, impacting response quality and speed. Paid users get expanded access to legacy models (including "o3" and "o4"), improved rate limits, and new personality options for GPT-5; the focus is on greater per-user model customization.** Commenters praise the transparency and flexibility, noting it's an improvement for power users versus the previous unified model approach. Some believe this reversion to legacy model options is transitional and will be phased out as unified models improve.
    - There's a technical discussion around the 3000/week limit for 'GPT 5 Thinking' prompts, which replaces the former o3 model. The commenter calculates that this equates to about 3.36 minutes per prompt if the week is fully utilized, suggesting that, for the vast majority of ordinary ChatGPT users, this is effectively quasi-unlimited—except for edge cases like using codex CLI and multiple agents.
    - A key theme is the differentiation between 'GPT 5 mini' (effectively unlimited usage and faster responses) and 'GPT 5 Thinking' (higher power, limited to 3000 prompts/week). There’s a question about the practical use cases for 'mini' now, outside of scenarios that demand high speed or are math-heavy, since most users wouldn’t hit the 'Thinking' cap in typical ChatGPT use.
    - Discussion highlights how OpenAI's rollback addresses advanced user concerns over flexibility versus simplicity. While a unified model is still the goal, bringing back the model picker with toggles gives power users fine control over model selection, though some speculate this will only be available temporarily until unified model quality is sufficient.

The author used a controlled prompt structure with ten body type descriptors (emaciated, skinny, slim, slender, fit, average, curvy, plump, chubby, obese) and the same seed, investigating the model's capacity to reflect nuanced differences in body morphology. Basic settings included Wan2.2-T2V...Q5_K_M.gguf, umt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled, Wan2.2-Lightning, Sage Attention, and 8 inference steps with no additional LoRAs. The experiment found limited diversity, especially among slimmer body types, indicating prompt sensitivity and model constraints in rendering visually distinct features for abstract or less exaggerated body descriptors.** Commenters noted that the first several images (up through 'fit') showed little differentiation, with some expecting clearer visual cues like muscle definition or emaciation. There is consensus that differences become more apparent with larger body types, reflecting possible limitations in model training data or prompt parsing granularity.
    - Commenters note inconsistencies in Wan 2.2's output for body types: the 'emaciated', 'slim', 'slender', and 'fit' categories display minimal differentiation, which suggests the model's latent representations do not adequately separate these phenotypes. *'Emaciated'* is expected to visualize with visible ribs and less muscle mass, while 'fit' should imply some muscle definition, yet the outputs are not distinct in these regards.
    - A technical gap is highlighted in both the model's training data and prompt handling: the transition from 'average' to 'overweight' is abrupt, and there is insufficient gradation between consecutive archetypes. This suggests that simple keyword changes may not elicit meaningful variations in body type, potentially due to limitations in the dataset labeling or model fine-tuning.

Technical discussion in the comments points out that current 'guardrails' are externally imposed by company policies—not intrinsic to the AI. For both text and image models, data control and use depend on pre/post-processing and organizational practices, not the model itself. Facial recognition models fundamentally lack context about user intent, making automated, context-aware safety infeasible; genuine enforcement requires external policy and regulation.** Commenters are skeptical of the supposed strength of AI text model 'guardrails,' noting data retention (e.g. for lawsuits) and ease of prompt engineering to bypass safety. There is also skepticism around the ethical business practices of facial recognition vendors, such as requiring untraceable crypto payments.
    - One commenter highlights a fundamental difference between guardrails for facial recognition models and text models like ChatGPT: facial recognition systems cannot determine user intent (e.g., whether uploaded images are for legitimate authentication or malicious purposes). The model also cannot control or even detect if input data (like face images) or outputs (identity information) are logged or misused, making traditional AI-centric "guardrails" less effective. Instead, the discussion emphasizes the necessity of external mechanisms, such as regulations and third-party audits, to ensure privacy and ethical use, paralleling controls that predate the generative AI era.
    - It is observed that text-based AI models (e.g., ChatGPT) also exhibit significant privacy and safety vulnerabilities. For instance, all chat logs are potentially retained (sometimes due to legal reasons, such as lawsuits), and so-called "safety" barriers can be circumvented through prompt engineering—enabling users to extract restricted or dangerous information, like instructions for illicit activities. This highlights that model-imposed filters are limited in preventing misuse and ensuring true privacy, regardless of modality.

- **Last RAG Solves Stateless LLMs**: The user is building **The Last RAG (TLRAG)**, a foundational **LLM architecture** that solves problems like statelessness and digital amnesia, lacking a genuine persistent identity, massive token costs, the context window war, and expensive fine-tuning cycles.
   - TLRAG introduces a persistent, long-term memory system combined with a **Dynamic Work Space (DWS)**, to allow the AI to curate its history and remember key interactions, decisions, and emotional contexts.
- **TLRAG Gives AI Persistent Identity**: TLRAG gives the AI a persistent identity core—the **"Heart"**, which is a living document shaped by its own synthesized experiences and memories, allowing it to develop a consistent, authentic, and self-aware personality over time.
   - It also leverages a **"Window Flush"** mechanism to assemble a lean, intelligent dossier with only the most relevant short-term and long-term memories, yielding validated cost savings of up to **98%** over long conversations compared to standard RAG.
- **NoChain Orchestrator replaces Frameworks**: The **NoChain Orchestrator** takes the core concepts of TLRAG and makes them robust and reliable for production, replacing complex, unpredictable agent frameworks with a deterministic, server-side control plane.
   - It uses hard-coded logic to manage memory, context, and tool use, eliminating the "black box" nature of many agentic systems and delivering predictable, reliable, and testable AI behavior, and more info can be found in their [blogpost](https://dev.to/tlrag/the-nochain-orchestrator-or-how-to-replace-frameworks-2p9a).
- **Explore TLRAG and NoChain concepts**: The user shared a few links to explore the concepts behind **TLRAG** and **NoChain**, including a [blog post](https://dev.to/tlrag/an-architectural-paradigm-for-stateful-learning-and-cost-efficient-ai-3jg3) and a [visual pitch deck](https://lumae-ai.neocities.org/).
   - This highlights the shift from stateless tools to stateful, persistent AI partners that learn and evolve.

> `Context Length, RTX 6000 Pro, DGX Spark, LM Studio on Lenovo Legion Go, LM Studio and RDP` 


- **Context Length impacts repetition**: Increasing the **context length** seemed to stop the model from repeating itself, possibly due to avoiding context overrun issues.
   - One user notes that *if the context is overrun and the LLM's response is the first generation after the system + user prompt, it will mess up and repeat itself forever*.
- **RTX 6000 Pro Users Unite**: Users discussed the **RTX 6000 Pro's** double-sided PCB with 96GB of GDDR6 memory using 3GB chips, and speculated about potential super refreshes with increased VRAM.
   - One user running **Qwen3-30b** at 260k context noted that upgrading to a 96GB card was a *game changer*.
- **Mobile LLMs make an appearance**: A user turned a **Lenovo Legion Go** into a portable localized LLM, while another installed **Qwen 3 4B** on a **ROG Ally**, noting it was pretty fast.
   - The user had to turn off the "thinking" function, otherwise it would stay thinking too much.
- **RDP Access Issues Surface**: A user reported that LM Studio couldn't load a model when accessed via RDP, potentially due to the **GPU** not being recognized.
   - Another user, however, stated that RDP works fine for them, and even RustDesk and Cloudflared allow API access from anywhere.

   - However, it was noted that excessive RAM usage might still limit performance due to only a portion of the large **gpt-oss 20B** model fitting into the **6GB VRAM**.
- **AMD iGPU Struggles with LLM Token Generation**: A user with a **Framework 13 laptop** (**AMD Ryzen 5 7640U** with **Radeon 760M Graphics**) reported slow token generation speeds with **Gemma 4B**, achieving only *6.55 tokens per second* with **10GB RAM allocated** to the iGPU.
   - It was suggested to check whether the CPU or GPU was being utilized during inference and to adjust the runtime to **Vulkan** or **ROCm** if the CPU was primarily engaged.
- **Model Experts Explain MOE**: When asked about the definition of MoE (**Mixture of Experts**), a member linked to a helpful [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/7yR5ScbK1qk?si=AFxEBU9SnGHw_-No) by Julia Turc.
   - MoE models consist of smaller *experts*, improving performance as only part of model needs to be parsed for each token, allowing model to be heavier without exponentially sacrificing performance.

- **Data Quality is Key**: One member suggested that making better quality and diverse data could solve the repetition issue.
   - Another member noted that decent quality data for post-training helps a lot.
- **RLHF for fixing repetition**: One member had pretty good luck using RLHF with repetitive outputs as the rejected to fix repetition.
   - They claimed that you kinda need some way of penalizing bad outputs to fully get rid of repetition, just positive reinforcement for good outputs isn't enough.

   - They reported that the current status of being able to train models on PyTorch with `torch.compile` results in `56 failed, 1398 passed, 8 xfailed in 64.57s`.
- **Optimize Max Graphs to Fuse Ops**: Members discussed whether there's a runtime performance penalty for using many small ops to build the **Max graph**, versus using bigger ops, questioning if the graph compiler fuses whatever is *fusible*.
   - A member from Modular responded that their fusion system is good but not perfect, and they default to assuming things will fuse well, adding workarounds for specific cases, and suggested filing issues when noticing things not working well.
- **MaxCompiler breaks with Mojo Custom Ops**: A member mentioned that they expect graph breaks when using custom ops written in Mojo or another language with the **torch-max-compiler**, but would like unit tests to understand the behavior and options for single graphs.
   - Another member from Modular responded that they bet they don't need to settle for a graph break.
- **ComfyUI and Kyutai to Get MAX**: A member predicted that **MAX** will be integrated into **ComfyUI** sooner than in **vLLM**, because MAX compiles the UNets used in image/video models significantly faster than other options.
   - Another member added that the unet compile times are so bad that most image and video people use eager for anything other than training.
- **AMD Kernel Build Time Screenshot**: A screenshot from the public AMD dev server shows that kernel build times took about an hour in total on a 2x64c server.
   - This points to opportunities to drastically improve compile times for machine learning models.
