- **Exploring Custom LLMPrompt Templates**: `@andreipopg` is trying to understand how to use a custom prompt with the SubQuestionQueryEngine. The user gets tips like "use the RouterQueryEngine for selecting specific data sources" and is advised that "SubQuestionQueryEngine uses a prompt for generating sub-questions," which can be customized ([GitHub example](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/tree/main/llama-index-integrations/question_gen)).
  
- **Troubleshooting Install Issues**: `@chbla.` is facing problems with `llama_index` installation, specifically with `set_global_handler` and `Settings`. `@whitefang_jr` suggests a full reinstall with `pip uninstall llama-index`, which resolves `@chbla.`'s issue.

- **RAG vs. No-RAG Evaluation**: `@addo__` is looking to evaluate GPT-3.5 with RAG on a dataset, as compared to using no RAG. `@whitefang_jr` provides a solution using the `FaithfulnessEvaluator` from LlamaIndex for the no-RAG option.

- **Local LLM Integration Inquiry**: `@miteshgarg_61244` seeks to use local offline fine-tuned LLM models with LlamaIndex's `NLSQLTableQueryEngine` and `SQLTableRetrieverQueryEngine`. `@whitefang_jr` recommends setting the local LLM as a global default in `Settings` and possibly deploying the model on a local server using FastAPI.

- **LlamaIndex Chat Engine Details**: `@vett93` wants to know the differences between `index.as_query_engine()` and `index.as_chat_engine()` after observing varying results using different LLMs. `@whitefang_jr` explains that `index.as_query_engine()` queries data for a response, while `index.as_chat_engine()` considers conversation history for stateful interactions.
