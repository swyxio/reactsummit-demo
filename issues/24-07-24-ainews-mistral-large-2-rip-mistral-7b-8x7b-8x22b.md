  **Mistral Large 2** introduces **123B parameters** with **Open Weights** under
  a Research License, focusing on **code generation**, **math performance**, and
  a massive **128k context window**, improving over Mistral Large 1's 32k
  context. It claims better **function calling** capabilities than **GPT-4o**
  and enhanced reasoning. Meanwhile, **Meta** officially released **Llama-3.1**
  models including **Llama-3.1-70B** and **Llama-3.1-8B** with detailed
  pre-training and post-training insights. The **Llama-3.1 8B** model's 128k
  context performance was found underwhelming compared to **Mistral Nemo** and
  **Yi 34B 200K**. Mistral is deprecating older Apache open-source models,
  focusing on Large 2 and **Mistral Nemo 12B**. The news also highlights
  community discussions and benchmarking comparisons.

It is instructive to consider the focuses of [Mistral Large in Feb 2024](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-large/?ref=upstract.com) vs [today's Mistral Large 2](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-large-2407/):

- Large 1: big focus on MMLU 81% between Claude 2 (79%) and GPT4 (86.4%), **API-only**, no parameter count
- Large 2: one small paragraph on MMLU 84% (still not better than GPT4!), 123B param **Open Weights** under a Research License, "sets a new point on the performance/cost Pareto front of open models" but new focus is on codegen & math performance using the ["convex hull" chart made popular by Mixtral 8x22](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-deepseek-v2-beats-mixtral-8x22b/)  ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/bdb9414a-a9a6-455e-8e8d-ad1cc1daf2f6.png?w=960&fit=max) 
- Both have decent focus on Multilingual MMLU
- Large 1: 32k context
- Large 2: **128k context**
- Large 1: only passing mention of codegen
- Large 2: "Following our experience with Codestral 22B and Codestral Mamba, we trained Mistral Large 2 on a very large proportion of code." ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/842708ad-cafb-4fa2-8a71-f392c69214e1.png?w=960&fit=max) 
- Large 1: "It is natively capable of function calling" and "JSON format"
- Large 2: "Sike actually our Function calling wasn't that good in v1 but we're better than GPT4o now"  ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b7986e07-a81f-4098-9057-8da4c5c75bae.png?w=960&fit=max)

- Llama 3.1: <<90 pages of [extreme detail on how sythetic data was used to improve reasoning and math](https://www.latent.space/p/llama-3)>>

Mistral's la Plateforme is deprecating all its Apache open source models (Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B and 8x22B, Codestral Mamba, Mathstral) and only Large 2 and last week's 12B [Mistral Nemo](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-nemo/) remain for its generalist models. This deprecation was fully predicted by [the cost-elo normalized frontier chart](https://x.com/swyx/status/1815892458519289946/photo/1) we discussed at the end of yesterday's post.

- **Utilizing SMT Solvers for LLMs**: @SMT_Solvers suggested that teaching LLMs to translate word problems from English/German to SMTLIB can yield significant reasoning capabilities, essentially a **MADLIBS synthetic data problem** using egraphs for exploration.
   - This sparks potential for advanced reasoning tasks through effective translation methods, enhancing overall model performance.
- **Repo Structure Updates In Progress**: @teknium announced plans to update the repository's structure and schemas today, inviting collaboration from others in the community.
   - @n8programs expressed eagerness for updates and offered assistance in the process, highlighting community engagement.
- **Moral Dilemmas in Reasoning Tasks**: A discussion emerged around whether to include a subsection for **difficult/moral** queries, like the **trolley problem**, as reasoning tasks that challenge models' foundational moral principles.
   - This raises questions about the implications of moral reasoning versus the straightforward logical evaluation of scenarios, inviting deeper analysis.
- **Reflection on the Trolley Problem**: Concerns were raised about the trolley problem assessing which moral foundations models adopt rather than pure reasoning capabilities, with @stefangliga questioning its purpose.
   - @_paradroid suggested that structuring prompts can clarify reasoning processes and thought evaluations, enhancing understanding of moral frameworks.
- **Structured Reasoning in Moral Queries**: @_paradroid shared a structured framework to analyze the moral implications of self-driving car decisions, aiming for superior reasoning clarity and accuracy.
   - The framework includes identifying initial thoughts, providing context, and reflecting on the reasoning process, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to moral reasoning tasks.

- **Larger Vocabulary Might Slow Inference**: Concerns emerged regarding a larger vocabulary size potentially *slowing down* inference, challenging the common belief that it reduces forward passes needed for **common sentences**.
   - One member questioned if this assumption was valid, suggesting that context may matter especially for **small models** where a vocabulary increase has a larger parameter impact.
- **Tradeoffs in Vocabulary Sizing Logic**: Discussion revolved around the idea that a smaller vocabulary compresses sequences, while a larger one potentially increases token count, which may complicate inference time.
   - Members debated the advantages of having fewer tokens for frequent phrases versus retaining finer interactions that larger vocabularies might miss.
- **Complexity in Vocabulary Research**: A member pointed out the potential high costs and narrow applicability of conducting thorough experiments to test vocabulary effects on different models.
   - They noted that findings might not generalize well, emphasizing the need for caution in broad claims about model capabilities.
- **Byte Pair Encoding's Role in Vocabulary Building**: One participant highlighted how **Byte Pair Encoding** (BPE) constructs vocabulary by first creating tokens for individual words and then merging them into larger tokens when context allows.
   - This process sparks discussion on whether using multiple tokens instead of a single compound token could enhance sequence comprehension and attention metrics.

- **Experimenting with DPO for Translation Models**: A member is inquiring if anyone has successfully fine-tuned a translation model using **DPO** due to insights gathered from the **CPO** paper.
   - They specifically refer to how **moderate-sized LLMs** don't match state-of-the-art models and point to the [CPO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08417) for more details.
- **CPO's Role in Improving Translation Models**: The **CPO** approach aims to address the shortcomings of supervised fine-tuning in machine translation, highlighting issues in reference data quality.
   - By training models to avoid generating just *adequate* translations, CPO enhances the performance of models like **ALMA-R**, which capitalizes on limited datasets.
- **ALMA-R's Standout Performance**: When applying **CPO** to ALMA models, significant improvements were noted despite only using **22K parallel sentences** and **12M parameters**.
   - The resulting model, **ALMA-R**, can compete with or even surpass conventional encoder-decoder models.
