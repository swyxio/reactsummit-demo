original_slug: ainews-fsdpqlora-the-answer-to-70b-scale-ai-for
description: >-
  **Jeremy Howard** and collaborators released a new tool combining **FSDP**,
  **QLoRA**, and **HQQ** to enable training **70b-parameter** models on
  affordable consumer GPUs like **RTX 4090s** with only **24GB RAM**, overcoming
  traditional memory constraints that required expensive data center GPUs
  costing over $150k. The approach shards quantized models across multiple GPUs
  and uses techniques like gradient checkpointing and CPU offloading to achieve
  efficient training on desktop-class hardware. The blogpost details challenges
  and solutions integrating these methods, highlighting a significant cost
  reduction from $150k to under $2.5k for training large language models.
  Additionally, Twitter recaps mention **Inflection AI**'s **Inflection-2.5**
  model rivaling **GPT-4** in benchmarks with less compute, and **Grok**
  improving speed by 3x. **Yann LeCun** discusses multi-step reasoning training
  for LLMs.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 3/7/2024-3/8/2024. We checked [**356** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **20** Discords (**326** channels, and **2933** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **366 minutes**.

[Jeremy Howard et al is back with a new tool](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-03-06-fsdp-qlora.html) for overcoming the memory constraints of doing 70b-scale training (either pretraining or finetuning, [we don't care](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1715099974650790209)), usually costing $150k for 4 H100s, on desktop-class GPUs, which cost under $2.5k. These GPUs max out at 24GB per RTX 4090 card, but 70B-params LLMs take >140GB (just for weights).

> Here’s the key point: the gaming GPUs have **similar performance** to the data center GPUs that **cost over 10x more**! It would be great if we could use these 10x cheaper (but nearly as fast) cards to train large language models, but we can’t, because they have much less memory. The best currently available data center cards have 80GB RAM, whilst gaming cards max out at 24GB RAM. Since only the largest models produce the best results, creating the best models has been largely inaccessible to most people.

## QLoRA Limitations

[The blogpost](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-03-06-fsdp-qlora.html) also gives a full account of QLoRA, HuggingFace's support, and the limitations they ran into:

> QLoRA didn’t quite slay the problem we set out to solve, to train a 70b model on 24GB cards, but it got closer than anything before. When quantized to 4 bits (which is 0.5 bytes), the 70b model takes 70/2 = 35 GB, which is larger than the 24GB gaming GPUs we want to use.

They also discuss memory needs for training, including batch sizing, all of which take required memory well beyond a single 24GB card.

## FSDP - Fully Sharded Data Parallel

- HF `transformers`'s `device_map='auto' setting - has a giant downside: only one GPU is ever active at a time, as all the others wait for their “turn”.
- DDP - only works if you have the full model on each GPU
- Meta's [FSDP](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html) library (see also [Llama-Recipes for FSDP finetuning](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes)) splits model params across multiple GPUs. "By being smart about copying the data of the next layer at the same time the current layer is busy calculating, it’s possible for this approach to result in no slowdown compared to DDP."

FSDP solves the memory limitation issue for H100-size GPUs - but a 320GB RAM system of 4 H100s would cost $150k.

## FSDP + QLoRA + HQQ

> "We figured that if we could use QLoRA to reduce the size of a model by around 400% (so a 70b model would fit into 35GB RAM), and then we used FSDP to shard that across two or more 24GB consumer cards, that would leave enough RAM left over to train a model."

2 RTX 4090s would cost under $2.5k.

FSDP didn't work out of the box with QLoRA quantization, and figured out how to workaround assumptions in the FSDP, PEFT, and LoRA libraries/algorithms to make this all work. The team also used [Gradient checkpointing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174), [CPU offloading](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html#torch.distributed.fsdp.CPUOffload), [FlashAttention 2](https://www.latent.space/p/flashattention), and [HQQ](https://mobiusml.github.io/hqq_blog/) which caused more integration issues. The blogpost has a lot more fascinating details for those who want to dive in.

Overall takeaway is clear:

- **Fine-Tuning Discourse with Hermes Mixtral DPO**: `@flozi00` is working on finetuning the **Nous Hermes Mixtral DPO model**, aiming for improvements before moving to train a classification model, but notes the process involves *sorting out much trash*.
- **Creating a Quality Translation Dataset**: In pursuit of quality translation estimations, `@flozi00` plans to set up an **Argilla space** to label translations from Google Translate, DeepL, and Azure Translate.
- **Targeting En-De Translation Pairs**: `@crispstrobe` recommends leveraging the EN-DE pairs from the OPUS 100 dataset to create a subset with reliable pairings suited for unspecific contexts, highlighting the dataset's utility in creating training subsets.
- **Dataset Licensing and Quality Concerns**: `@philipmay` shares that the mMARCO dataset now has an Apache 2.0 license but encountered issues with viewing the dataset on HuggingFace, indicating the need for assistance to make the **dataset viewer** work.
- **Public Collection for Translation Data Quality**: `@flozi00` mentions an update to their judge model and datasets, seeking additional tips for improvement, which is now part of a [HuggingFace collection aimed at measuring translation pair quality](https://huggingface.co/collections/flozi00/translation-data-quality-65e9d0cdd977e1e0aed2de9d).

- **Merging German Translations with SPIN**: `@johannhartmann` shared that they use a German translation of the slim orca dataset for **Mistral merges**, applying a SPIN-like method across multiple steps. They create datasets with answers from multiple models for the same translated instruction/input-pair, which has led to observable drifts in the model's responses, sometimes becoming more verbose or degrading post-merge. They plan to clean up and upload the dataset soon.
  
- **Brezn3 Outshines Brezn-7b**: `@crispstrobe` expressed amazement as **Brezn3** scores 63.25 on EQ-Bench (v2) (de) without revision, outperforming Brezn-7b's score of 58.22. They inquired whether this was solely due to changing the base model to **LeoLM/leo-mistral-hessianai-7b-chat** and setting `tokenizer_source: base`, or if different DPO modifications were applied.
  
- **DPO Still Baking for Brezn3**: `@johannhartmann` responded that the DPO process for Brezn3 is still underway, with approximately 13 hours remaining before completion.
