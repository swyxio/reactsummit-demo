title: RIP Latent Diffusion, Hello Hourglass Diffusion
date: '2024-01-24T01:38:15.342406Z'
original_slug: ainews-rip-latent-diffusion-hello
description: >-
  **Katherine Crowson** from **Stable Diffusion** introduces a hierarchical pure
  transformer backbone for diffusion-based image generation that efficiently
  scales to megapixel resolutions with under 600 million parameters, improving
  upon the original ~900M parameter model. This architecture processes local and
  global image phenomena separately, enhancing efficiency and resolution without
  latent steps. Additionally, Meta's Self Rewarding LM paper has inspired
  **lucidrains** to begin an implementation. Discord summaries highlight GPT-4's
  robustness against quantification tricks, discussions on open-source GPT-0
  alternatives, challenges in DPO training on limited VRAM with suggestions like
  QLoRA and rmsprop, and efforts to improve roleplay model consistency through
  fine-tuning and merging. Philosophical debates on AI sentience and GPT-4
  customization for markdown and translation tasks were also noted.

Katherine Crowson, of Stable Diffusion fame, is back with a monster: [Direct pixel-space megapixel image generation with diffusion models](Direct pixel-space megapixel image generation with diffusion models): 

> a hierarchical pure transformer
backbone for image generation with diffusion models that
scales to high resolutions more efficiently than previous
transformer-based backbones. Instead of treating images the
same regardless of resolution, this architecture adapts to the
target resolution, processing local phenomena locally at high
resolutions and separately processing global phenomena
in low-resolution parts of the hierarchy. 

This updates the Latent Diffusion architecture (which Stable Diffusion is based on) with a fundamentally redesigned UNet which is less like a CNN and more Transformery. She also uses a bunch of SOTA inference tricks because why not:

The net result of all this is more efficiency - a hierarchical transformer arch that has an O(n) complexity, enabling it scale well to higher resolutions, like creating megapixel-scale images without any latent steps, with a <600m param model (the original SD was ~900M).

**In other news**, the Self Rewarding LM paper from Meta has gathered enough attention for [lucidrains to start work on an implementation](https://github.com/lucidrains/self-rewarding-lm-pytorch).

- **Best Approach to Finetuning for Domain Adaptation?**: `@sunbeer_` inquired about the best method to finetune **Mistral** for domain-specific knowledge such as 18th-century France; they considered training on a corpus of French texts. `@mrdragonfox` advised starting with *PEFT* (Prompt-based Finetuning) to adapt styles and potentially a full finetune if necessary, utilizing the linguistic patterns of that era.
  
- **Content Over Style for Historical Context**: `@sunbeer_` clarified that their aim is to add new content, not just the style, to which `@mrdragonfox` suggested that existing models might already contain relevant old words and recommended starting with PEFT to evaluate the need for further pretraining.

- **Pretraining with a Closed-source Dataset**: `@sunbeer_` mentioned the intent to use a closed-source dataset, opting for pretraining followed by a full finetune. `@mrdragonfox` suggested looking at resources like a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) for guidance and emphasized the cost-effectiveness of starting with PEFT before committing to full finetuning.

- **Finetuning for Domain-specific Knowledge**: `@sunbeer_` asked if PEFT could incorporate intricate domain knowledge, like understanding why certain behaviors were considered insults among French noblemen. `@mrdragonfox` responded that a RAG pipeline (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) might be better for fact-specific queries, while style adaptation can be done with PEFT.

- **Chatbot Customization for Industry-specific Jargon**: `@augustin.poelmans_58429` sought advice for creating a chatbot that understands industry and company-specific acronyms and processes, considering a RAG app or finetuning. The chatbot is intended to work on in-house hosted infrastructure, and they were contemplating whether **Mistral's models** would be suitable.

- **How to Make Mistral Forget Chats**: `@dizzytornado` asked how to reset the memory of previous chats in Mistral, and `@mrdragonfox` noted that the model itself has no memory, and any semblance of "remembering" is due to the front end passing the entire context back in the chat history, as Mistral and all LLMs (Large Language Models) are designed to be stateless.
