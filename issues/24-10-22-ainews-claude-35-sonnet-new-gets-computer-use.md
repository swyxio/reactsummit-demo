3.5 Sonnet, already delivers significant gains in coding. The new 3.5 Haiku (with benchmarks on [the model card](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/1cd9d098ac3e6467/original/Claude-3-Model-Card-October-Addendum.pdf)) matches the performance of Claude 3 Opus “on many evaluations for the same cost and similar speed to the previous generation of Haiku”. 

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/4cf7338a-9345-4c0c-90d7-fae6013a7957.png?w=960&fit=max)
Notably on coding, it [improves performance](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1848742740420341988
) on SWE-bench Verified from 33.4% to **49.0%**, **scoring HIGHER than o1-preview's own 41.4%** without any fancy reasoning steps. However, **on math** on 3.5 Sonne's 27.6% high water mark still pales in comparison to o1-preview's 83%.

**Other Benchmarks:**

- **Aider**: The new Sonnet tops aider's code [editing leaderboard](https://x.com/paulgauthier/status/1848808149945618933) at **84.2%** and  sets SOTA on aider's [more demanding](https://x.com/paulgauthier/status/1848839965201076618) refactoring benchmark with a score of **92.1%**!
- **Vectara**: On Vectara's Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model Sonnet 3.5 [went from](https://github.com/vectara/hallucination-leaderboard) **8.6 to 4.6**


**Computer Use**

Anthropic's new Computer Use API ([docs here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use), [demo here](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo)) point to [OSWorld](https://os-world.github.io/) for their relevant screen manipulation benchmark - scoring **14.9%** in the screenshot-only category—notably better than the next-best AI system's score of 7.8%. 

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/a2a32df1-bb32-47d8-913f-d7775e7a4725.png?w=960&fit=max)

When afforded more steps to complete the task, Claude scored 22.0%.  This is still substantially under human performance in the 70’s, but is notable because this is essentially the functionality that Adept previously announced with its Fuyu models but never widely released. In a reductive sense "computer use" (controlling a computer via vision) is contrasted against standard "tool use"  (controlling computers via API/function calling).

> - `SAE interpretation pipeline`
> - `Evaluation techniques for explanations`
> - `Causal feature explanation`
> - `Feature alignment using Hungarian algorithm`
> - `Open-source tools for LLMs`

- **New Open Source SAE Interpretation Pipeline Launched**: The interpretability team is releasing a new open source [pipeline](https://github.com/EleutherAI/sae-auto-interp) for automatically interpreting **SAE features** and neurons in LLMs, leveraging LLMs themselves.
  
  - This initiative introduces **five new techniques** for evaluating explanation quality, enhancing interpretability at scale.
- **Causal Effects Lead to Better Feature Explanations**: For the first time, it is demonstrated that explanations for features can be generated based on the **causal effect** of steering a feature, differing from traditional context-based methods.
  
  - This approach yields insights into features previously considered uninterpretable, marking a significant advancement in the field.
- **Alignment of SAE Features Using Hungarian Algorithm**: The team has found that **features of different SAEs** can be aligned using the **Hungarian algorithm**, focusing on those trained on different layers of the same network.
  
  - This method reveals that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream exhibit almost identical features, excluding MLPs.
- **Large-Scale Analysis Affirms Interpretability of SAE Latents**: Their analysis confirms that **SAE latents** are significantly more interpretable than neurons, even with sparsified neurons using **top-k postprocessing**.
  
  - This finding encourages further exploration into autoencoders for better interpretability in LLMs.
- **Collaboration Opportunities and Resources Available**: Interested collaborators are encouraged to check the channel for ongoing work related to the SAE interpretation project.
  
  - The team appreciates contributions from various members, and resources like their [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13928) and [dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/auto_interp_explanations) are shared.

> - `Non-archival workshops`
> - `Chess AI model integration`
> - `Chess move explainability`
> - `Stockfish analysis speed`
> - `Research goals in AI development`

- **Navigating Non-archival Workshop Submissions**: It appears possible to submit the same paper to multiple workshops as long as their rules allow, particularly non-archival ones that don’t interfere with conference submissions.
  
  - However, some conferences may not accept papers previously presented at such workshops, so it's vital to verify individual conference policies.
- **Integrating Chess AI and LLMs for Enhanced Interaction**: A member proposed the idea of combining a chess-playing AI with an LLM to enable a conversational model that understands its own decisions, rather than a simple query-response setup.
  
  - This design aims to create a more coherent system where the chess AI's reasoning aligns with its conversational capabilities, allowing for a deeper dialogue about its moves.
- **The Intricacies of Chess Move Explainability**: Discussions revolved around the ability of chess players to explain top-tier moves made by engines, with some suggesting that many moves are often deemed as 'computer stuff' that lack clear justification.
  
  - This highlights a divide between human understanding and engine logic, as even experts may struggle to rationalize certain high-evaluation moves during live commentary.
- **Stockfish's Remarkable Analysis Capabilities**: One member mentioned that a version of Stockfish can evaluate up to **28 million nodes per second**, suggesting a significant analytical power in assessing positions.
  
  - This statistic brings into question claims about different engines' capacities, emphasizing the impressive performance of modern chess engines.
- **Clarifying Research Goals for AI Integration**: A member encouraged specificity regarding the research goals for AI, questioning the motivations behind wanting the bot to achieve certain tasks.
  
  - This inquiry aims to uncover the expected learnings and benefits from an integrated chess AI, fostering a deeper exploration of its potential use cases.

- **Leverage Instruction-Tuned Models for Training**: A member suggested using an instruction-tuned model like **llama-instruct** for instruction training, emphasizing its advantages if users don't mind its previous tuning.
  
  - They recommended mixing strategies but acknowledged that *experimentation* is essential for finding the right balance.
- **Concerns on Catastrophic Forgetting**: A member raised concerns about whether to use only domain-specific instruction data or mix with general data to avoid **catastrophic forgetting**.
  
  - The suggestion was to explore various approaches to determine the best method, reflecting the complexities of model training.
- **Pretraining vs Instruction Fine-Tuning**: Discussion highlighted whether to start with a base model for continued pretraining on raw domain data before instruction fine-tuning, or to use an instruction-tuned model.
  
  - One member suggested leveraging raw data at the beginning if available, as it may provide a stronger foundation.
- **Generating Instruction Data from Raw Text**: One member expressed their plan to use **GPT-4** for generating instruction data from raw text, pointing out potential biases and coverage limitations.
  
  - This method could mitigate the reliance solely on human-created instruction data while acknowledging possible drawbacks.
