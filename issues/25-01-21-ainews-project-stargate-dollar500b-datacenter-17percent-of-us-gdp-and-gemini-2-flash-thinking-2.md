> AI News for 1/20/2025-1/21/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **34** Discords (**225** channels, and **4353** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **450 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Days like these are a conundrum - on one hand, the obvious big earth shattering news is the announcement of [Project Stargate](https://x.com/openai/status/1881830103858172059?s=46), a US "AI Manhattan project" led by OpenAI and Softbank, and supported by Softbank, OpenAI, Oracle, MGX, Arm, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. For scale, the actual Manhattan project [cost $35B inflation adjusted](https://x.com/tanayj/status/1881849682063986843?s=46).

Although this was [rumored since a year ago](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-plot-100-billion-stargate-ai-supercomputer?rc=ytp67n), Microsoft's [reduced](https://x.com/smokeawayyy/status/1881801442459033662?s=46) role as exclusive compute partner to OpenAI is prominent by its absence. As with any splashy PR stunt, one should beware [AI-washing](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/1881839728250765709), but the project is very serious and should be treated as such.

However, it's not really news you can use today, which is what we aim to do here at your local AI newspaper.

Fortunately, Noam Shazeer got you, with [a second Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking](https://x.com/NoamShazeer/status/1881845901872001293), with another big leap on 2.0 Flash, and 1M long context that you can use today (we will enable in AINews and Smol Talk tomorrow):

> `PPO Clipping Dynamics, RL Stability Techniques, RLVR Application on R1 Models` 


- **PPO Clipping Dynamics Highlight Asymmetry**: A user noted that nesting the clip inside the min produces **asymmetrically weighted updates** in regions of **[-1, 1]**, where negatives get clipped but positives do not.
   - After realizing a mistake in the order of applying advantage and clipping, they observed it still produces a weird asymmetry that *softens positives while exacerbating negatives*.
- **RL Techniques Aim for Stability**: Discussion around the justification for clipping techniques revealed it’s aimed at **stability**, similar to gradient clipping in LLM training.
   - The effectiveness of such techniques in reinforcement learning was suggested to be influenced by traditional methods where **negatives = death** and **small rewards = working**.
- **Exploring RLVR for R1 Model Applications**: With the recent **r1 model drop**, interest in trying out **RLVR** for specific use cases was expressed, questioning compatibility with ‘open-instruct’ tools.
   - Confirmation was given that all models should work since it's built on **transformers**, but new verifiers must be created for specific data.

This has raised questions about how it will impact events like the NAIRR, which relied on executive funding.
   - Participants noted the potential for an AI cold war stemming from geopolitics, rather than AI itself being at fault.
- **Concerns over Llama License Changes**: There is speculation that Scale AI may have convinced Meta to change their Llama licensing terms following the release of 'Defense Llama' for national security applications [source](https://defensescoop.com/2024/11/04/scale-ai-unveils-defense-llama-large-language-model-llm-national-security-users/). Observers remarked that this raises ethical concerns as defense-related deployments become more mainstream.
   - One noted that the same day 'Defense Llama' was introduced, Meta removed the 'thou shall not warfare' clause from their licensing.
- **AI as an Arms Race**: There is a growing consensus among community members that AI development resembling an arms race may be inevitable. Concerns were raised about the implications of framing AI development in adversarial terms, as it could lead to heightened geopolitical tensions.
   - One user shared a perception that regardless of the efforts made, they believe it will always be an arms race situation.
- **Discussion about NAIRR Event**: Members expressed uncertainty over whether the NAIRR event they were invited to would still take place after the EO was rescinded. The event was initially funded as a pilot but lacked Congressional approval for continuation.
   - Participants speculated whether the EO's changes would disrupt the expected trajectory of AI policies and funding related to research resources.
- **Live Coverage of Trump's AI Infrastructure Announcement**: A live stream was shared featuring President Trump's expected announcement regarding a multi-billion dollar investment in AI infrastructure [link](https://www.youtube.com/live/r8LYbHbDJyg?si=QPb48vP8ZFjhFdae). A community member expressed regret for missing the live broadcast, hoping to catch the key points later.

> `DeepSeeks Group Relative Policy Optimization, Review Process Challenges, Collaboration of Authors and Reviewers` 


- **Understanding GRPO in AI Optimization**: [DeepSeeks Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)](https://fixupx.com/natolambert/status/1881380809153847711) is highlighted as PPO without a value function, using Monte Carlo estimates for advantages, which simplifies the model's complexity.
   - *Understanding the existence of PPO is crucial*, especially given the complexities of value functions with large language models.
- **Policy Optimization with Average Rewards**: The paper discusses how GRPO eliminates the need for additional value function approximation as required in PPO, utilizing the average reward from multiple sampled outputs instead.
   - This insight into GRPO suggests enhanced efficiency in optimizing policies for AI models, as cited in the [recent publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300v3).
- **Challenges in Conference Paper Reviews**: Concerns were raised about needing more authors per paper to act as reviewers, as overburdening one reviewer can lead to inadequate evaluations.
   - One participant shared that recruiting **12 reviewers** from **50+ interested individuals** was necessary to obtain three high-quality reviews for each submission.
- **Overcoming Reviewer Shortages**: The need for extensive outreach was emphasized, as one user mentioned sending personalized messages as part of their efforts to secure quality reviews.
   - Despite these efforts, they felt the necessity to review several submissions personally, reflecting a **significant pressure** on the review system.

> `Quantifying Uncertainty in LLMs, Chain of Thought in LLMs, RL-LLM Instruction Prompts, Distillation in RL` 


- **Models should quantify uncertainty**: *A member suggested* that models should be able to quantify uncertainty to some degree with the current approach, enhancing their reliability.
   - This concept aims to improve the interpretability and confidence of LLM outputs.
- **LLMs performing self-cot**: *Another member noted* that it feels like LLMs are conducting their own chain of thought (CoT) before providing answers, adding depth to the generated responses.
   - This observation highlights the potential of LLMs to reason internally before making statements.
- **Need for RL-LLM thinking-step prompts**: *A suggestion was made* for adding instruction prompts for thinking-steps in RL-LLM systems, complementing the existing goal-setting prompts.
   - This addition could enhance the model's reasoning process, leading to more informed outputs.
- **Improving RL on distillation**: *Another member pointed out* that RL techniques can still be applied on top of model distillation, potentially leading to further improvements.
   - It would be interesting to see if smaller models exhibit significant enhancement through this method.
